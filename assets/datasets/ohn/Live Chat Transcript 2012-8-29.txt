Welcome Timothy!

13:00:30
Timothy D
Hey DeeDee.

13:01:25
deedee
Any questions, topics, etc., you want to start with today?

13:01:34
Timothy D
I still haven't been told results from my blood work in June that was causing me to get leg cramps at night :(

13:02:11
deedee
Welcome Bob!

13:02:23
Timothy D
I ordered the smooth flow system. Can I use my easy enema bag and nozzle and just change hoses?

13:02:34
Bob
Hello, hoping you're having a good day!

13:02:45
deedee
Timothy, did you get your blood work done at a clinic?  What do they say about where your results are?

13:03:14
deedee
Yes, you can definitely use your smooth flow on the easy enema system.

13:03:28
Timothy D
Yes, she did them right there in her office and then sent the blood to a county hospital lab.

13:03:33
Bob
Missed last chat, and the archives are not current.

13:03:37
deedee
I am having a good day; how about you?

13:03:44
Bob
Just great.

13:04:49
deedee
Bob, the last scheduled chat did not happen due to technical difficulties here.  Since we launched the new website, the old passwords were not working and we had to update that, so all should be well now!

13:05:37
Bob
Good... so July did not happen?

13:06:06
Timothy D
They had it set up for August 1st, I believe, Bob.

13:06:16
deedee
No, I can't remember the date of the last one.  Was it in June?  That seems so long ago, doesn't it?

13:06:20
Bob
Yes, that's right.

13:06:29
Bob
Yes, must have been June.

13:06:55
Bob
Yes, tempus fugit... way too fast when you're an old man like me.

13:07:33
deedee
Yes, I do remember that.  I do not remember if we had one in July or not.  The summer was very busy and I do remember having a client who had a sort of emergency which required me to miss the chat.  That could have been in July.

13:07:50
Bob
Anyway, as long as a fix now.

13:08:16
Timothy D
DeeDee, what other essential oils will help with back pain and leg cramps besides peppermint?

13:08:44
deedee
I think a couple of our regular chat people may be in the area of the bad storm/hurricane, so they probably do not have power.  Hopefully this one won't be as terrible for them.

13:09:06
Bob
Timothy, I'd push your medical providers about those blood results... should be available in a couple of hours.

13:09:09
Timothy D
I hope so also.

13:09:25
Bob
Agree.

13:10:09
Timothy D
Yea, I called them Monday and I got an answer saying they would fax it in 10 minutes but no answer yet lol.

13:10:21
Bob
Unacceptable!

13:10:32
Timothy D
I agree.

13:10:41
deedee
Tim, do you take magnesium and calcium at all?  Some oils that can help are rosemary, cypress, marjoram, lavender -  but it may make a difference as to what may be causing this as to what I would recommend.  Can you give me some background?

13:10:42
Bob
You don't mess around with leg cramp delays.

13:11:32
deedee
Any history of blood clots, etc.?

13:11:46
Timothy D
Bob, what started the cramping is I was the one who drew the short straw and had to sleep on a skinny couch in a cabin back in May and the cramps happen 2 to 3 times a week since.

13:12:01
Bob
A cardiology venous study would be good.

13:12:46
Timothy D
I have a shunt from bleeding on brain since I was a baby and 2 people in family have had strokes.

13:12:59
deedee
So, do you think the leg pain stems from the back pain?

13:13:01
Bob
All the more reason not to delay.

13:13:13
deedee
Do you feel it is muscle or nerve?

13:13:26
Timothy D
Muscle.

13:14:02
Timothy D
When I get the cramps I can usually get up and move around and it goes away. It only happens when lying down.

13:14:22
deedee
Magnesium deficiencies are common in heart issues, as well as muscle (heart is a large muscle), so have you ever tried that?

13:14:24
Bob
Wonder where the oldtimers in here are... can't all be in the LA area.

13:14:56
Timothy D
I have not tried anything like that.

13:15:03
deedee
I know one from LA, one on east coast for sure.

13:15:55
Bob
Any swelling of tissues, Tim?

13:16:33
deedee
I would recommend trying some magnesium - we have a supplement called reacted magnesium which is also good for the bowels if you have issues there.

13:16:36
Timothy D
Once I get that system in I thought of trying a series over the weekend and see how long it helps and see if I need to do them weekly.

13:16:38
Bob
Hi Stacy.

13:16:40
deedee
Welcome Stacy! 

13:17:13
Stacy L
Sorry I'm late - just got home. Have I missed anything good?

13:17:27
Bob
Everything good in here.

13:17:58
deedee
Stacy, any questions, concerns, etc?

13:18:20
Timothy D
Everyone in family is guessing it's from low potassium but I eat plenty of bananas.

13:18:28
Stacy L
I'm interested in becoming a hydrotherapist and was looking for more information / encouragement.

13:19:22
deedee
Timothy, it is really all about balancing the minerals.  Have you ever had a hair tissue mineral analysis done through us?  I highly recommend it since you do not seem to be getting any answers medically.

13:19:59
deedee
Anything I can do Stacy; I would be more than happy to talk to you more about that.  What state are you in?

13:20:00
Timothy D
No I haven't. Once I can save up the money I was going to do that next.

13:20:01
Stacy L
A few months ago, I received your newsletter and it had an article on hormonal-related bowel issues.  I wanted to read it, but lost the info before I had a chance.  Do you remember it, if so, where might I find the article?

13:20:18
deedee
Great Timothy!

13:20:42
Stacy L
DeeDee, I'm in Texas.  I received a few treatments back in 2001, but the regulations have changed and I haven't been to anyone since then.

13:21:44
Timothy D
Stacy, what part of Texas? I haven't found a colon hydrotherapist here in SW Oklahoma.

13:21:47
deedee
Stacy, we archive all of our newsletters under Media.  I will try and find what newsletter it was in.  I think May 2012.

13:22:35
Stacy L
Tim, I'm near Ft. Hood.  We don't have anyone.  I would have to go to Metroplex or Austin... and then would need a doctor's prescription.

13:22:51
deedee
Texas is a strict state for hydrotherapists.  Don't you also have to be a massage therapist, or have a doctor's order or a doctor on staff or something like that?

13:23:24
deedee
Are the doctor's prescriptions easy to obtain?

13:23:48
Stacy L
Not sure yet.  I know it's changed since I first went and that person no longer works here.  Not sure about prescriptions yet - really makes me angry.

13:23:54
Bob
Tim, if it were myself, I'd try a Dr. Bragg vinegar and honey small mix in enemas.

13:24:11
deedee
I wonder if you can get a naturopath's order for one.  You could briefly talk to one online and ask if they can prescribe one.

13:24:36
Stacy L
Also - what do you recommend for cleaning enema, tubes, etc.?

13:25:40
Bob
I use a small vinegar mix... and later a small chlorox mix.

13:25:44
deedee
Stacy, here I use Young Living's Thieves cleaner.  You can also use Grapefruit Seed Extract and/or peroxide.

13:26:11
Bob
I should add for cleaning the tubes.

13:26:35
Bob
Not me!!

13:27:00
Stacy L
I've been hanging mine up and letting the tube dry, just boiling the applicator, not cleaning the tube!!  Should I clean it each time I use it (the tube and bag)?

13:27:01
deedee
We do not recommend bleach because of its toxicity.  The bags, etc., can absorb some of that and it can leach back into the cleansing water the next time.

13:27:24
Bob
Interesting... not aware of that.

13:27:50
deedee
You can run some cleanser through the system each time, but as long as there is no back flow and you dry it well, it should be OK.

13:28:11
Bob
Been doing it for 60 years.

13:28:17
Stacy L
Good - always afraid of that.

13:28:26
Timothy D
DeeDee, I've been washing my equipment with either Dove bar soap or 1 of the 2 soaps I got from you guys then soaking it in grapefruit seed extract for 45 minutes.

13:28:35
deedee
Bob, I am glad it has worked for you.

13:29:50
deedee
I did a video a while back on ways we recommend to clean your equipment and with what products, but I do not think it has been edited and posted yet.

13:30:18
Timothy D
No, I haven't seen it yet.

13:30:23
deedee
Are any of you currently using any essential oils?

13:30:36
Timothy D
Peppermint here.

13:30:52
Stacy L
No.  Do you mean in the enema?  What is recommended?

13:30:52
Bob
Yes, as inhalants.

13:31:23
deedee
Last Saturday I attended a day-long seminar on the healing properties of the essential oil products and I can't wait to start implementing these things more in my practice and sharing it more with all of you guys.

13:31:54
Timothy D
I mostly use it in the enemas but sometimes when in back pain I'll inhale it instead of taking pain killers and it works good.

13:33:00
deedee
We have kind of taken using essential oils to a new level in colon cleansing and also healing with them by absorption of the colon.  I don't think anyone else has really gone there too much yet, but I am using it in practice with great results.  

13:33:14
Bob
I use the essential oil soaked into a terra cotta pendant, and wear around the neck, so it can be lightly inhaled.

13:33:30
Stacy L
Very interested - will more info be on blog?

13:34:18
deedee
The colon is a site for high absorption of healing elements which will go directly to the blood stream and through the sytem to the areas that it is needed most for healing.  

13:34:26
deedee
Also, therapeutic essential oils can cross the blood brain barrier which is a great tool for healing! 

13:34:27
Timothy D
I've read Kristina's book. Now I wanna watch the 2 videos but gotta save the money to get them.

13:35:12
deedee
Using oils topically and through aromatherapy and internally through drinking or putting it into a capsule also can be very effective.

13:35:40
deedee
Stacy, I am not sure because I am not doing the blogs right now, but maybe! 

13:36:30
deedee
Young Living oils (which we use) are considered the only therapeutic grade and internal grade oils there are.

13:37:02
Timothy D
DeeDee, which of the citrus oils would you recommend I try to help with my problems?

13:39:17
Timothy D
Being on SSI makes it hard to order in bulk or multi items :(

13:40:24
deedee
Well, lemon is good for high blood pressure, orange is good for inflammation and circulation, grapefruit is good for fluid retention, plus many, many other things.

13:40:41
Stacy L
DeeDee, do you know of places for certification?  I've been studying about I-ACT in San Antonio, but that is the only one I've found.

13:41:11
deedee
I am not sure if any of the citrus would be the best choice for the muscle situation you are going through unless it is related to heart, circulation, etc.

13:41:59
deedee
Stacy,  www.i-act.org has a list of all of the certified schools in U.S.  I went to Chicago.

13:42:14
Timothy D
The back pain only happens when I sleep wrong or lift heavy objects.

13:42:50
deedee
Timothy, I can make you a small bottle blended with many oils that we think would work - fairly inexpensively if you ever want to try that.

13:43:24
Timothy D
OK, I'll email you when I have the money.

13:44:30
deedee
What are some other issues you want to address with oils?

13:45:10
Timothy D
Those are the only 3 problems I have; medically I been doing good otherwise.

13:45:55
deedee
Timothy, have you checked out all of our free videos on the website?  I know you mentioned purchasing the DVDs, but you can get a lot of info free on the website.

13:46:15
Bob
I highly recommend the immune boost oil as an inhalant... just soaked into the terra cotta pendant... so the aroma flow is very light.

13:46:42
deedee
Timothy, let's plan next to do the hair analysis when you can so we can get to the root of the issues first.

13:47:24
Timothy D
Yes, that's where I found out about the smooth flow system that I just ordered and I've also watched the one where you mix the oils to make suppository trays.

13:47:47
deedee
Bob, that is great, especially during cold and flu season. It is great to diffuse all over your house also, and use as disinfectants, etc., instead of all of the chemicals and those terrible hand sanitizers that create the super bugs!

13:48:27
Bob
I have chronic lymphocytic leukemia... and truly believe the immune booster oil helps my energy balance system.

13:49:11
deedee
Bob, are you using the Young Living ImmuPower, or which one?

13:50:45
Bob
I started with Young Living, but really feel it's a rip-off... Switched to a less expensive non-layered marketing brand and results are the same... I feel.

13:51:36
Timothy D
Bob, I didn't pay that much for peppermint.

13:52:42
Timothy D
Bob, do you do your enemas in the evening or morning?

13:53:45
Bob
In the morning.  I have a massage therapist LPN come in twice weekly who does energy balancing massage and gives me a very slow coffee enema every other treatment.

13:54:57
Timothy D
Ahhh, I've been doing mine in the evening cause I live in governmentt housing and not sure when maintenance or anyone similar will want to inspect apartment or what.

13:55:25
Timothy D
Hey Victoria.

13:55:37
Bob
I have always done my enemas in the morning... Your system gets normalized a  bit before bedtime.

13:56:15
Timothy D
I'll try that on weekends maybe because no one comes around then. It's just Mon-Fri.

13:56:45
Bob
My massage/enema sessions take over two hours... all very slow.

13:56:45
deedee
Welcome Victoria!  Do you have a quick question before we end in 4 minutes?

13:57:57
Victoria
End! You must start at 10 my time. 

13:58:16
deedee
We are Central time.  What time zone are you?

13:58:51
Victoria
Mountain time.

13:59:11
Bob
Was nice chatting.  Tim, all the best to you at getting a diagnosis and treatment going... especially the long overdue diagnosis!

13:59:48
deedee
I think some areas of Mountain are one hour behind and some areas are 2.  I know Pacific time is 2 behind.

13:59:56
Timothy D
Yup, I hope so too. I was told a natural trick for cramps but not sure if it will work.

14:00:09
Bob
Share it quick.

14:00:28
Timothy D
tsp of mustard or pickle juice.

14:00:37
Bob
Like my Dr. Braggs.

14:00:41
deedee
Thank you all for joining today.  I will be posting the next chat soon once I figure out my schedule.  See you all next time!
