Hi guys

18:12:51&nbsp;
kristina
How are ya all doing?

18:14:00&nbsp;
kristina
Topics for today...please do chime in...for instance, Tom, I would be honored if you gave details about your visit.

18:14:37&nbsp;
kristina
I also wanted to return to the topic of prostate health that I addressed in the February Newsletter.

18:15:12&nbsp;
TomIA
I did the hydrotherapy / FIR / Massage also got information on using flowmaster I purchased, Will be back this Friday for a 2nd visit

18:16:10&nbsp;
TomIA
The 18-21in snow that week in Febuary made it a bit of a challenge but was worth the effort

18:16:23&nbsp;
kristina
I also wanted to point out a post that was recently made on the colon cleanse message board:

18:16:26&nbsp;
kristina
 I made a strange but WONDERFUL discovery. I started taking milk thistle capsules to aid in cleansing my liver because of the daily pain meds I take. Well, low and behold almost 2 weeks later, I have had 1-3 bowel movements almost EVERY DAY unaided since I started taking it! Yes. I haven't needed a daily enema or cascara sagrada to help me go. At one point, I was so constipated, I was having to take higher doses of the cascara and it was becoming less and less effective and I was relying on enemas almost every day to have a bowel movement. From what I've read, milk thistle is supposed to be a "mild" laxative. Well, I only know that I have become very regular since starting this regimen. I am thankful for this blessed discovery and just wanted to share it with other constipation sufferers out there.

18:16:42&nbsp;

that is because you are so busy, kristina, hope you enjoy the concert.  

18:17:31&nbsp;
TomIA
I still have not been able to log into the message board but do review the updates

18:17:48&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, I am very busy. How did you know that I am going to a concert, Michael? I am going to see a UW professor, Robert Taylor play 3 Beethoven Sonatas, all by memory tonight at 7

18:18:08&nbsp;
Lisa
I'm glad you read the link I sent you on that post! It is a good post.

18:19:02&nbsp;
Lisa
All professional pianists play by memory!

18:19:11&nbsp;
TomIA
I am using the goat milk soap with frankincense/myrrh for my first rounds as suggested for prostate

18:22:54&nbsp;
TomIA
Does anyone have issues with colon tubes turning around or folding back

18:23:43&nbsp;
lynn
hello everyone, it's been a while for me

18:23:45&nbsp;
Lisa
Is it common to feel more hungry after eating something salty? I know sugar does that, but salt too?

18:24:24&nbsp;
kristina
Lisa, it depends on what the salty food is. Specifically what foods make you feel more hungry?

18:25:18&nbsp;
Lisa
Really, just about anything that is salty. Better cut down on it I guess.

18:25:39&nbsp;
kristina
It is most likely the carbohydrate in the food that is making you feel more hungry.

18:25:59&nbsp;
Lisa
yes, that makes sense!

18:27:06&nbsp;
michael b
the earlier, softer colon tubes did tend to fold back, tom, but the newer are harder.   

18:27:33&nbsp;
kristina
The goat milk soap with frankincense and myrrh is proving to offer excellent relief from some prostate issues. I am starting to recommend that all men who take enemas use it in the first or second enema in the series or both of these enemas.

18:27:48&nbsp;
lynn
Is a colon tube of 36" the best delivery device for olive oil

18:27:52&nbsp;
lynn
I bought this from you

18:28:06&nbsp;
TomIA
Tried the new 70d tube but had issues with it.  Will be speaking to Dee Dee about this on my visit this week.

18:28:19&nbsp;
kristina
I find that colon tubes are best used in the later enemas in the series and not the first enema in the series. 

18:29:11&nbsp;
lynn
Hello Kristina, do you feel the goat's milk should be retained when doing this for the prostate

18:29:20&nbsp;
TomIA
I used the regular inflatable flex nozzle for first enema then the colon tube

18:29:21&nbsp;
Lisa
My silicone colon tube works great!

18:29:47&nbsp;
lynn
Kristina, I'm Lynn (male) if you might remember

18:30:15&nbsp;
kristina
Our silicone colon tube FR 32 is a stiffer 70 Durometer Colon Tube, is 30", and is the colon tube that I would recommend for delivering olive oil into the colon.

18:30:30&nbsp;
lynn
so nice to see you Lisa 

18:31:06&nbsp;
lynn
Kristina, I ordered the colon tube from you

18:31:28&nbsp;
TomIA
Yes the one with the delrin tip, I started with the flowmaster colon setup and flex nozzle then bought the delrin tip

18:32:40&nbsp;
Lisa
By the way, I can't imagine not using the flowmaster. Works great!

18:32:49&nbsp;
kristina
No, the goat's milk doesn't need to be retained. However, it is possible that retaining the frankincense and myrrh soap for 5-12 minutes would be more therapeutic.

18:33:05&nbsp;
kristina
Do you always use the Flowmaster for your enemas now, Lisa?

18:33:12&nbsp;
lynn
Tom, do you insert olive oil

18:33:22&nbsp;
Curtis
also more effective

18:33:31&nbsp;
Lisa
Won't use anything else! 

18:33:50&nbsp;
TomIA
Are you speaking about as a lube or implant?

18:34:04&nbsp;
lynn
Tom, yes a implant

18:34:17&nbsp;
kristina
I must say that I am very proud of having developed the Flowmaster Colon Cleanse Programs

18:34:37&nbsp;
TomIA
Not yet I did purchase it but have not used it yet

18:35:05&nbsp;
kristina
They are proving to be a fabulous tool for the colon cleanse. To read more about this enema product, go to http://www.enemabag.com/complete_colon_cleanse.html

18:35:13&nbsp;
Lisa
The pump on the flowmaster makes the water go so much deeper! Can a colon tube be used with it to make it even deeper?

18:35:24&nbsp;
TomIA
I liked the flowmaster it helps me hold more volume without issue.

18:35:34&nbsp;
kristina
Welcome, Carol!

18:35:38&nbsp;
lynn
Kristina, I need to get on course with your programs, I have been using  enemas for bowel movement assistance

18:36:16&nbsp;
Carol45
Hi - so sorry I won't be able to join you this evening.  I am just now leaving work and took a moment to pop in.

18:36:19&nbsp;
nibroc
Corb is here

18:36:21&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, Lisa, a colon tube may deliver the enema solution even deeper than the Flowmaster Pump does.

18:36:37&nbsp;
kristina
Thanks everyone for coming a couple of hours earlier to this chat.

18:37:02&nbsp;
lynn
Kristina, may I sign up for email notice?

18:37:03&nbsp;
TomIA
I use the colon tube with the flowmaster delivery system

18:37:15&nbsp;
Lisa
That's okay Kristina! The concert sounds great!

18:37:50&nbsp;
kristina
If you already own an enema bag, and want to pump delivery system of the Flowmaster, you can simply invest in one of our Smooth Flow Syringe and Hose Systems

18:38:07&nbsp;
kristina
Email notices for what?

18:38:10&nbsp;
nibroc
Regarding fold over of colon tubes--I have difficulty with a Fr43 doing the fold over

18:38:18&nbsp;
nibroc
any suggestions

18:38:19&nbsp;
lynn
For chat

18:38:27&nbsp;
Lisa
Do you mean the newsletter?

18:38:53&nbsp;
lynn
Didn't we used to get a email when chat was, or was that discontinued

18:39:07&nbsp;
Lisa
Chat info is in the newsletter.

18:39:10&nbsp;
kristina
That is a good question. Do you get our emails for our monthly newsletter yet?

18:39:24&nbsp;
lynn
Yes,so sorry Kristina

18:39:57&nbsp;
lynn
Olive oil is do good for colon troubles

18:40:30&nbsp;
kristina
No, I also send out a reminder of the Live Chat a day before. Given that I am not the technical expert of the business, I recommend trying to sign up for the newsletter again. At this point, you can ask to receive the reminder for the chat, too. If that doesn't work, email me.

18:40:31&nbsp;
TomIA
Foldover issues was with the silicone colon tube that came with the flowmaster package, FR32,  

18:40:55&nbsp;
lynn
Thank you Kristina

18:41:27&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, add olive oil to the colon before you try to insert the colon tube with an implant syringe and a shorter colon tube

18:41:36&nbsp;
lynn
Lisa, do you also use olive oil

18:41:49&nbsp;
kristina
Hi Corb. How are things with you?

18:42:39&nbsp;
TomIA
I have been using the super salve and surg-lube will have to try the olive oil

18:42:46&nbsp;
kristina
Thank you. What did you purchase?

18:42:55&nbsp;
Lisa
I tried olive oil, but felt too messy. I don't really need it anyway. I use enemas mostly for cleaning and use peppermint oil and sea salt most of the time.

18:43:26&nbsp;
nibroc
The video package and the 3 quart amber bag---haven't used it yet 

18:43:49&nbsp;
lynn
Yes olive oil is messy, you need to prepare, also best used at night and retained

18:44:27&nbsp;
kristina
The idea with the olive oil is to aid the process of deeply inserting the colon tube. One doesn't need to use olive oil, but it can help.

18:45:08&nbsp;
lynn
Kristina, you do believe in them for implants don't you?

18:45:10&nbsp;
kristina
FYI-we are just about permanently out of our 3 quart amber bags. 

18:45:44&nbsp;
lynn
Makes me sad as I was going to order the amber one

18:45:49&nbsp;
kristina
skus 141 and 306

18:46:00&nbsp;
Lisa
I'm very lucky that I don't really have any health problems, and I use enemas to help prevent problems and take out any toxins I may have.

18:46:01&nbsp;
kristina
We still have a handful left.

18:46:05&nbsp;
nibroc
the six quart amber bag looks frightening 

18:46:27&nbsp;
lynn
You do, wonderful! I will order!

18:46:33&nbsp;
kristina
We will be stocking a 2 quart amber enema bag similar to the 3 quart except in its size.

18:47:08&nbsp;
TomIA
You don't have to put in 6 qts

18:47:39&nbsp;
kristina
I don't recommend taking all 6 quarts at once. However, the 6 quart bags don't have to be refilled after each enema in the series.

18:48:01&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, I do believe in olive oil as a therapeutic implant.

18:48:09&nbsp;
lynn
We are so lucky we have you and your company Kristina

18:49:36&nbsp;
Lisa
OHN is one of a kind. I'm gratefull too!

18:49:41&nbsp;
kristina
Speaking of colon implants, I have recently been working with Chlorophyll   from Standard Process as a colon implant. I find that it will help the body to heal hemorroids, anal fissures, and issues with inflammation in the colon. 

18:51:52&nbsp;
TomIA
I will try the olive oil would I just use it straight or mix with enema water? I am thinking oil will not blend?

18:52:16&nbsp;
lynn
Tom, I put in only olive oil

18:52:17&nbsp;
kristina
Chlorophyll contains hormone precursors and has the reputation of a stimulant for tissue support. Chlorophyll Complex is regarded as a natural gastrointestinal tract deodorant and cleanser

18:52:30&nbsp;
kristina
What items?

18:52:45&nbsp;
kristina
Thanks, Lisa

18:52:53&nbsp;
lynn
The chlorophyll

18:52:57&nbsp;
kristina
Thanks, Lynn

18:53:10&nbsp;
Lisa
You're welcome Kristina!

18:53:19&nbsp;
kristina
We do offer the chlorophyll but only via the phone, 608-242-0200.

18:53:21&nbsp;
lynn
Welcome Kristina

18:53:39&nbsp;
kristina
The Standard Process company does not want us to offer their products on the internet. 

18:53:41&nbsp;
lynn
I will be calling Kristina

18:54:05&nbsp;
curtis
TomIA  you have to continually mix water and oil

18:54:18&nbsp;
lynn
But will get my order together

18:55:11&nbsp;
kristina
The chlorophyll comes in capsules, which need to be opened and added to a small amount of olive oil. I would use the implant syringe with olive oil.

18:55:42&nbsp;
lynn
Yes, I have an implant syringe

18:55:45&nbsp;
kristina
You could also add it to a small amount of water.

18:56:18&nbsp;
TomIA
I purchased the stainless bucket for implant use,  will try the straight olive oil followed with the enema water and see if that helps with the delrin tube, I will check out the implant syringe on my visit this week.

18:56:27&nbsp;
kristina
 I recommend using the olive oil on its own or with aloe vera. 

18:56:36&nbsp;
lynn
Would the chlorophyll keep one awake if taken at bedtime with my olive oil

18:56:38&nbsp;
Lisa
By the way, I've been taking Hoodia for a month now and it really works! But I wonder if it could be working as a placebo. I guess we never really know about that.

18:56:41&nbsp;
kristina
That is great, Lisa.

18:57:20&nbsp;
lynn
Tom, I use a enema metal bucket for olive oil

18:57:21&nbsp;
kristina
Next Live Chat April 9th at 7 pm.

18:57:47&nbsp;
lynn
Thank you for a warm welcome, I will be at the next chat

19:02:41&nbsp;
kristina
Thanks, Lisa. Chat is now closing all....

19:02:50&nbsp;
TomIA
bye
