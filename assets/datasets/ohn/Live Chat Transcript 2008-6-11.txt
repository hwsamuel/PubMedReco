Dave
i am first in, 

19:52:58&nbsp;
kristina
Hello to both of you!

19:53:06&nbsp;
Lisa
Hi everyone! No student now, so I can make it tonight!

19:53:14&nbsp;
kristina
This is great, Lisa.

19:53:20&nbsp;
Dave
beaten out by lisa again!

19:53:36&nbsp;
kristina
Dave, you were in first!

19:53:44&nbsp;
kristina
What do you both think of the new website?

19:53:58&nbsp;
Lisa
Yes, you were! I get the silver! LOL!

19:54:09&nbsp;
Dave
Kris, hope you DeeDee and all escaped terrible floods your area.

19:54:49&nbsp;
kristina
Mostly I have. DeeDee has to take an alternative route to work because a bridge is closed on her usual route. 

19:54:58&nbsp;
Lisa
The new site is wonderful! Worth the wait!

19:55:02&nbsp;
kristina
We are expecting more torrential downpours tonight.

19:55:11&nbsp;
Dave
I always want to go first Lisa, LOL.

19:55:48&nbsp;
Dave
Probably best you back in cirty, Kris.

19:56:27&nbsp;
kristina
Thanks, Lisa. And, yes.

19:57:03&nbsp;
Dave
be nice to resurrect previous chts, but whatever.

19:57:50&nbsp;
kristina
We will be posting all previous chat pages and all previous newsletters soon.

19:59:44&nbsp;

Hello Everybody!

20:01:08&nbsp;
Billy the Kid
Has anybody heard of a 2 qt silicone Enema Bag?

20:01:37&nbsp;
TomIA
Never seen a 2 quart

20:03:23&nbsp;
kristina
I want to have a 3 quart silicone enema bag molded but I need to generate the down payment for the mold first. I don't think that there are any other silicone bags on the market aside from the 4 quart silicone bag.

20:03:41&nbsp;
kristina
Are you aware of any other silicone enema bags available? 

20:04:36&nbsp;
Billy the Kid
No, I am not.

20:04:51&nbsp;
kristina
What is your interest in a 2 quart silicone enema bag?

20:04:53&nbsp;
TomIA
The only one I have found is the 4 qt Klystra like the OHN

20:05:32&nbsp;
TomIA
I like the larger 4 qt and the opening for cleanup

20:06:23&nbsp;
Billy the Kid
Anything larger than 2qts is a little too much for me. I would prefer to have a good visual of the solution movement.

20:07:06&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, the 4 quart silicone bag is very easy to clean. In the cleanliness department the only issue I have with it is it tends to collect hair and dust.

20:08:12&nbsp;
TomIA
You can watch water movement very well in the 4 quart even at low flow rates

20:09:01&nbsp;
kristina
We do have the 2 quart amber that is translucent

20:09:13&nbsp;
kristina
This is true, too.

20:09:34&nbsp;
Billy the Kid
Yes, I have one.

20:10:13&nbsp;
Dave
Dave is back from glitch.

20:10:40&nbsp;
Dave
Any way to catch up on what said?

20:11:02&nbsp;
Lisa
By the way, I hope all of you are growing your own tomatoes these days!

20:11:47&nbsp;
Dave
Are TX ones on banned list?

20:11:58&nbsp;
Lisa
Yes!

20:12:00&nbsp;
kristina
Sorry, Dave, but you mostly only missed discussion of the 4 quart silicone bag and the amber 2 quart bag that are featured in this month's newsletter.

20:12:11&nbsp;
Billy the Kid
Creole Tomatoes have been declared safe down here.

20:12:16&nbsp;
kristina
What is the deal with tomatoes?

20:12:17&nbsp;
TomIA
like the new website really sharp work

20:12:20&nbsp;
Dave
OK thanks.

20:12:32&nbsp;
Billy the Kid
Salmonella.

20:12:44&nbsp;
kristina
Thanks, Tom. I would love to hear specifics from folks about what they like about the new website.

20:12:56&nbsp;
Lisa
There are recalls in 16 states!

20:13:04&nbsp;
kristina
For tomatoes?

20:13:13&nbsp;
Lisa
Yes!

20:13:14&nbsp;
Billy the Kid
Yes

20:13:36&nbsp;
TomIA
Around here they are saying full country because of distribution on the tomatoes

20:14:25&nbsp;
Dave
Certain varieties in certain states. Probably best to check FDA etc websites for details.

20:14:51&nbsp;
TomIA
How's Madison faring with the water levels Iowa is hurting

20:15:28&nbsp;
kristina
Madison seems to be doing fine.

20:16:02&nbsp;
jesse
Your new website is superb, Kristina

20:16:32&nbsp;
Billy the Kid
I am enjoying it as well. Job well done.

20:16:53&nbsp;
Dave
Just back from weeklong car trip, and colonic Friday will be welcome! BTW, like site much too.  

20:17:56&nbsp;
TomIA
Does anyone use the delrin tipped colon tube?

20:17:57&nbsp;
kristina
On tomatoes:

20:17:59&nbsp;
kristina
buy from some local vendors, or grow your own. I'll be buying from local fruit stands that buy from local growers, as my tomatoes are iffy, at best, this year. (The squash and okra, on the other hand are looking promising!) Don't be afraid of cherry or grape tomatoes, and the tomatoes sold as "on the vine" are also deemed safe.

20:18:34&nbsp;
Dave
That's what I have read/seen.

20:18:51&nbsp;
kristina
Thank you, thank you, and thank you. I am fishing for specifics on what you all like.....

20:19:28&nbsp;
Billy the Kid
Pictorial is much better for one thing.

20:19:29&nbsp;
Lisa
Nothing better than garden tomatoes!

20:19:55&nbsp;
TomIA
I just got a look at the new site yesterday will get up to speed and give you some feedback

20:19:56&nbsp;
Dave
Maybe direct link to forum, to encourage participation?

20:20:28&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, aren't all the photos spectacular! The fact that you can see the detail of each and every product.

20:20:43&nbsp;
kristina
And, that you can search for products more easily.

20:21:30&nbsp;
Lisa
Did KJ help you on the site? Great work!!

20:21:33&nbsp;
kristina
Until I get to a place where I can run the forum, we will be leaving it off. However, I do hope to offer more live chats on a week-to-week basis. 

20:21:50&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, KJ put in a zillion hard-working hours.

20:22:12&nbsp;
Dave
Just like at the corner drug store, way back when, LOL. This is 21st century version.

20:22:57&nbsp;
maree
am i too late

20:23:21&nbsp;
TomIA
35 minutes left

20:23:23&nbsp;
Billy the Kid
Not at all, welcome.

20:23:31&nbsp;
maree
excellent ty 

20:23:31&nbsp;
kristina
No, you are not too late.

20:23:37&nbsp;
maree
is there a set topic ? 

20:23:43&nbsp;
Dave
great to make live chats more often, encourage sign-ons..

20:24:05&nbsp;
TomIA
open forum ask your questions

20:24:11&nbsp;
maree
ok ty 

20:24:23&nbsp;
Lisa
More live chats would be great Kris! Then we don't have to wait a whole month if we miss a chat!

20:25:08&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, I think so, too. I know of some companies that have live chat daily. I don't think I will go that route but once a week ought to be doable.

20:25:19&nbsp;
maree
that would be lovely 

20:25:26&nbsp;
maree
*raising hand* 

20:25:27&nbsp;
TomIA
that would be excellent

20:25:29&nbsp;
Dave
Sounds great.

20:25:36&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, maree

20:26:06&nbsp;
maree
enemas relating to someone without a gallbladder - what is recommended for equipment - 

20:26:07&nbsp;
kristina
One topic that I would love to hear from each of you on is what foods do you eat that you feel keep you healthiest? 

20:26:18&nbsp;
TomIA
does anyone use olive oil implants and what retention time is typical

20:26:20&nbsp;
kristina
Welcome Dean and Michael

20:26:53&nbsp;
kristina
I encourage folks to hold the olive oil implants as long as they are able to -- one to 24 hours even.

20:26:56&nbsp;
TomIA
Have switched all my salt to the celtic sea salt 

20:27:02&nbsp;
Lisa
I feel just eating less makes me feel healthier.

20:27:22&nbsp;
Billy the Kid
I used Olive Oil once or twice and found it very difficult to retain.

20:27:41&nbsp;
kristina
maree, any of the enema equipment would work if you don't have a gallbladder. Have you read through our enema equipment buying guide?

20:28:19&nbsp;
kristina
How often do you eat, Lisa? Or is it how much do you eat when you eat? 

20:28:22&nbsp;
Dave
re food, anything that provides adequate fiber.

20:28:28&nbsp;
maree
what i have on hand is normal bag /tube style but also colon tube - and wondering about using a bulb syringe for that - 

20:28:43&nbsp;
kristina
This would be a good moment to point out my number 1 health tip

20:29:00&nbsp;
maree
as my partner is sight challenged w/ traditional bag /tube style

20:29:13&nbsp;
Lisa
It depends on my day. If I do eat more often, it is smaller amounts.

20:29:19&nbsp;
kristina
Bulb syringes are used when you only want to clear out the lower colon, rectal area.

20:30:00&nbsp;
maree
alone yes, but to aid in conjunction w/ colon tube for application only 

20:30:10&nbsp;
kristina
A bulb might work well for your partner. You would want to have a bowl full with water to refill the bulb syringe continuously and in this way you could clear out more of the colon. 

20:30:23&nbsp;
maree
ok just what i was thinking , ty 

20:30:51&nbsp;
maree
for me re: healthiest i use alot of homeopathy too - so if i need to i use pau d'arco tea enemas 

20:31:01&nbsp;
Dave
Bulbs good for emergencies, probably how most years ago got started getting enemas.

20:31:02&nbsp;
kristina
I detail working with a bulb syringe in my downloadable movie, Small Volume Enemas.

20:31:13&nbsp;
Billy the Kid
I eat only when I am hungry and stop when I feel "full". My weight stays down and I can eat most anything I want.

20:32:26&nbsp;
kristina
Right now the downloadable movies are all on sale and if you buy with the newsletter coupon you will get close to a 25% discount on all the downloadable colon cleansing videos.

20:32:34&nbsp;
maree
there is a site which has recipes of homeopathic uses for enemas 

20:32:54&nbsp;
maree
this would be great to include on this site 

20:33:03&nbsp;
Billy the Kid
I do, however, maintain a regular and consistant Enema Schedule.

20:33:12&nbsp;
TomIA
Some use organic green teas for enemas 

20:33:49&nbsp;
Lisa
I like green tea for enemas! It really cleans me out!

20:33:54&nbsp;
kristina
you can enlarge the chat screen by clicking on the float function in the lower right hand corner

20:34:18&nbsp;
kristina
how often do you take enemas, Billy?

20:34:49&nbsp;
Billy the Kid
Every four days.

20:35:06&nbsp;
kristina
Do you take an enema series or one enema? What solutions do you use?

20:35:13&nbsp;
kristina
How long have you been doing that?

20:35:50&nbsp;
kristina
Welcome, Lynn

20:36:04&nbsp;
lynn(male)
hello Kristina, so nice to be back

20:36:10&nbsp;
Billy the Kid
I take a series of at least three. I use Celtic Salt, Peppermint Oil and sometimes I throw in a little Baking Soda.

20:36:12&nbsp;
lynn(male)
hello everyone

20:36:16&nbsp;
maree
it wont let me post the site in here 

20:36:22&nbsp;
Lisa
Hi Male Lynn!

20:36:29&nbsp;
Dave
Billy, schedule good. Must of us started off with enemas given as needed. by mom. You too? 

20:37:10&nbsp;
Billy the Kid
Yes, needed or not!

20:37:17&nbsp;
TomIA
I have to work solo and find a bag a lot more friendly than the bulb method

20:37:59&nbsp;
kristina
Thanks much.

20:38:25&nbsp;
kristina
Lynn, do you have anything on your mind tonight about health and/or the colon cleanse?

20:38:36&nbsp;
kristina
What about you, Jesse?

20:38:39&nbsp;
TomIA
The flowmaster system works well for solo use and control of flow.

20:38:45&nbsp;
maree
solo not an option - too short to reach *) 

20:39:12&nbsp;
lynn(male)
Kristina, someone was trying to tell me that one should use mineral oil instead of olive oil, so you will not absorb all the oil and weight gain?

20:39:57&nbsp;
jesse
As I think I have indicated by phone, from medication induced chronic constipation, I take a daily self-administered 4-quart cleansing enema.  

20:40:14&nbsp;
lynn(male)
I use the olive oil monthly with one of your 36" colon tubes

20:40:25&nbsp;
Lisa
There, I got the screen big now. So much better!

20:41:05&nbsp;
kristina
I write about this issue of mineral oil on enemabag.com in the Using Enemas Safely section.

20:41:29&nbsp;
jesse
And per an earlier question, I have had my gallbladder out since 1992, and in October 2006, I had cryoablation prostate cancer surgery.   

20:41:53&nbsp;
kristina
Mineral oil is derived from petroleum.  Mineral oil enemas are potentially unsafe for enema use because used internally, mineral oil has the ability to be absorbed by the colon. Once in the body, mineral oil goes into the liver, via the colon, as coffee does. Mineral oil depletes and poisons the liver, pulling out oil-soluble vitamins and minerals which are then excreted into the feces. Mineral oil enemas, done regularly, will lead to nutritional deficiencies.

20:42:37&nbsp;
maree
i want to do a coffee regimen and visit an hydrotherapist but none close

20:42:37&nbsp;
kristina
Well done, Lisa

20:42:43&nbsp;
lynn(male)
I will never use mineral oil

20:43:39&nbsp;
kristina
You can give yourself, or have another person give you, an enema series that equals the therapeutic value of colon hydrotherapy. You will need to take the enemas in a series. 

20:44:10&nbsp;
kristina
Coffee enemas detoxify the body. They assist the body to heal more deeply when used in conjunction with a detox diet or program.  The coffee enema was first rigorously used as a healing treatment by Dr. Max Gerson, MD, in the 1940s and 1950s, to treat his cancer patients.

20:44:34&nbsp;
Lisa
Because I have more free time tomorrow, I plan a coffee enema. OHN coffee. I've been very tired lately, and sure that will help.

20:44:43&nbsp;
kristina
To learn more about coffee enemas, go to http://www.enemabag.com/coffee_enema.html.

20:45:10&nbsp;
lynn(male)
Lisa, I will get coffee this weekend,they are so wonderful!

20:45:46&nbsp;
Lisa
I have a coffee maker in my bathroom!

20:45:48&nbsp;
maree
i have my filtered water but may have to drink that bc of the flooding here if we lose water 

20:46:12&nbsp;
Dave
Only mineral oil I got (only orally) was to soften stool as kid,  but can enema was the real cure. Fleet of course does have mineral oil enema bulbs, wonder how well they sell.

20:46:29&nbsp;
lynn(male)
I'm so sorry for those here having water issues, I know all about that here too

20:46:49&nbsp;
maree
i don't use fleets

20:47:02&nbsp;
maree
i like being in control just as much there of what goes in my body 

20:47:06&nbsp;
Lisa
I hate fleets!!

20:47:13&nbsp;
maree
ty lynn

20:47:26&nbsp;
lynn(male)
welcome maree

20:47:52&nbsp;
maree
its pau d' arco tea brewed really strong, use and hold 10 min intervals is great for rebuilding immune system after a round of antibiotics

20:47:55&nbsp;
maree
or green tea 

20:48:12&nbsp;
lynn(male)
Kristina,you have a wonderful business, you help so many people

20:48:20&nbsp;
lynn(male)

kristina, congratulations on getting the forum and the store up and working. 

20:48:57&nbsp;
kristina
It certainly is a blessing to be doing the work that I do. I have the honor of consulting with people the world over. 

20:49:01&nbsp;
lynn(male)
we are all lucky to have OHN!

20:49:15&nbsp;
maree
yes thank you and the new site looks great 

20:49:31&nbsp;
kristina
Thanks, Michael. The forum is taking a rest right now.

20:50:42&nbsp;
lynn(male)
I for one was blessed with a Mother that gave regular enemas, I feel blessed

20:51:25&nbsp;
jesse
I concur totally with all of the positive comments about OHN.  I had not planned to be disabled, but it is such a blessing to be able to purchase the products I need from you, Kristina, Dee Dee, and all of your OHN staff, in a compassionate environment.

20:51:33&nbsp;
maree
Kristina I will email you that site to look over 

20:51:40&nbsp;
lynn(male)
She is 84 and still using, and even asks if my wife is giving, and says it will help you live longer

20:52:12&nbsp;
kristina
Awwww.....Thank you....thank you....thank you....

20:52:45&nbsp;
maree
I think it helps to - realize there is a community out there for us 

20:52:55&nbsp;
Dave
lynn, were OK with them from the start, as that's a hangup for too many? Lots of converts here, lol.

20:52:56&nbsp;
maree
and this site bridges that gap 

20:53:25&nbsp;
lynn(male)
Kristina,you are really a star!:D 

20:53:47&nbsp;
lynn(male)
Yes, agree Dave and Maree

20:53:48&nbsp;
kristina
Next Scheduled Live Chat is Wednesday, July 9th at 7pm, CST. I hope all of you can make it.

20:53:58&nbsp;
maree

20:54:03&nbsp;
Lisa
Any plans for another book Kristina?

20:54:04&nbsp;
lynn(male)
I want to come back

20:54:06&nbsp;
jesse
Before the time is up, I just want all of you who are in the flood area to know you are in my thoughts and prayers.

20:54:14&nbsp;
Billy the Kid
It is such a scary subject for so many people. Shame 

20:54:26&nbsp;
lynn(male)
Yes I'm with Jesse on that

20:54:37&nbsp;
lynn(male)
Goodnight everyone

Yes, there is a large community of folks who find the colon cleanse to be a superb health tool. You are all in good company.

20:57:09&nbsp;
kristina
Thanks for keeping in touch!

20:59:47&nbsp;
michael b
