hi, kristina and dave I hope all is well with both of you

20:00:28&nbsp;
kristina
And, you, too Michael.

20:01:18&nbsp;
Jesse R.
Good evening, Kristina and everyone else.  I hope all are well.

20:01:53&nbsp;
Dave
Seeing  chiropractor tomorrow for first time. Good experience here, or otherwise?

20:03:08&nbsp;
kristina
Tonight we will discuss many issues but the first I will start with is Vitamin D, its role in health and how to optimize your Vitamin D levels. Please do feel free to bring up other topics that you would like to discuss. I may address them as we go or wait until the end.

20:03:09&nbsp;
Jesse R.
Kristina: I am so looking forward to being in Madison Sept 8-12 to meet all of you and to receive treatment.

20:04:01&nbsp;
michael b
will this live chat continue for a long time?

20:04:17&nbsp;

HI Kristina, sue here, hi all

20:04:40&nbsp;
kristina
We here at the Optimal Health Center are looking forward to your visit too. If you wish, you can let others know why you are coming to the Optimal Health Center and what treatments you might be having.

20:04:47&nbsp;
kristina
Hi Sue. Welcome.

20:05:00&nbsp;
kristina
Do you mean tonight or through the years?

20:05:20&nbsp;
kristina
According to the National Center for Health Statistics, as many as 36% of Americans are vitamin D deficient. 

20:05:36&nbsp;
kristina
How many of you have had your vitamin D levels tested? 

20:05:52&nbsp;
sue b
my son just 20 years old and goes in the sun got tested last month and is deficient

20:06:07&nbsp;
sue b
i now take a supplement and plan to get tested

20:06:12&nbsp;
kristina
D deficiency in adults has been linked to an increased risk for osteoporosis, osteomalacia ? the softening of bones ? and certain cancers, autoimmune diseases and cardiovascular problems.

20:06:20&nbsp;
Dave
I'll be at OHN in October as well,  for a fall cleaning vs spring cleaning, lol.

20:06:28&nbsp;
kristina
Vitamin D also may play a role in preventing diabetes and hypertension, according to the National Institutes of Health. A study in last week's Archives of Internal Medicine found that men 40 to 75 with below-normal vitamin D levels had a higher risk of heart attack.

20:07:05&nbsp;
kristina
What were your son's Vitamin D levels, Sue and why did you have him tested?

20:07:32&nbsp;
sue b
his endo did it cuz he had high calcium

20:07:36&nbsp;
sue b
and found the low d

20:07:44&nbsp;
Jesse R.
I have both EGD to check status of Barrett's Esophagus and Colonoscopy Sept 15.  I have not been able with the miserable laxatives to get adequate cleansing in the past; thus I am coming for enemas to start the process along with some FIR Sauna and Massage

20:07:50&nbsp;
sue b
he takes 1000 units now daily

20:08:00&nbsp;
kristina
The American Medical Association (AMA), the nation's largest physician organization, voted today at its Annual Meeting to adopt the following new public health policy: The current Reference Intake Values for Vitamin D were established by the Food and Nutrition Board in 1997. Current research suggests that the Upper Limits for adults is likely overly conservative. Today the AMA called on the FDA to re-examine the current Daily Reference Intake Value for Vitamin D in light of new scientific findings. &quot;The health benefits of Vitamin D are plentiful, such as strong bones and a reduced risk of breast cancer and cardiovascular disease,&quot; said AMA Board Member Steven Stack, M.D. &quot;It's time to take a good look at the current daily recommended level of Vitamin D and ensure that Americans know the appropriate levels so they can reap the full health benefits.&quot;

20:08:27&nbsp;
michael b
that is a good question, how does one get vitamin D tested?

20:08:35&nbsp;
Jesse R.
I likely start PCa treatment later in the year, and I think we have to totally know my esophagus and colon status prior to that.

20:08:46&nbsp;
sue b
when i go for blood work next i am asking for it

20:08:53&nbsp;
Dave
I am getting nicely browned in southern sun, so Vit D intake probably OK, but take some supplementally too.

20:08:58&nbsp;
sue b
his endo said this would be in then news prominently very son

20:09:06&nbsp;
kristina
The only blood test that can diagnose vitamin D deficiency is a 25-hydroxy-vitamin D [25(OH)D].  Get your levels above 50 ng/ml, year around.  Unfortunately, about 10-20% of the doctors in the USA order the wrong test.  They order a 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D, thinking that by measuring the most potent steroid in the system, they are getting useful information.  They are not.  1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D is an adaptive hormone; it goes up and down with calcium intake.  Furthermore, as 25(OH)D is a weak steroid, when 25(OH)D levels are low, the body compensates by increasing the amount of the potent steroid, 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D.  Thus, a common cause of high 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D is low 25(OH)D or vitamin D deficiency.  So these doctors see the 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D is normal or high and tell their patients that they are OK when they are vitamin D deficient, advice that may prove fatal.  Furthermore, the reference labs in this country know this is occurring but, to date, have not taken steps to educate the doctors ordering the test because the reference labs make more money off a 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D than they do from a 25-hydroxy-vitamin D.  Although the misdiagnosis of vitamin D deficiency may prove fatal, the doctors, and the reference labs, are ordering and processing the wrong test. 

20:09:17&nbsp;
sue b
Dave -- my son runs in the sun and walks over all the city of Boston and he was low

20:09:21&nbsp;
sue b
we were very surprised

20:09:29&nbsp;
sue b
he gets a lot of sun

20:09:57&nbsp;
kristina
Here are some general guidelines regarding whether or not you ought to supplement with Vitamin D:

20:10:08&nbsp;
kristina
If you live in Florida and sunbathe once a week, year around, do nothing.  If you use suntan parlors once a week, do nothing.  However, if you have little UVB exposure, my advice is as follows.  Well children under the age of two should take 1,000 IU per day, over the age of two, 2,000 IU per day.  Well adults and adolescent between 80 pounds and 130 pounds should start with 3,000 IU per day, over 130 pounds but less than 170 pounds, 4,000 IU per day and over 170 pounds, 5,000 IU per day.  Two months later have your doctor order your first 25-hydroxy-vitamin D blood test.  Yes, start the vitamin D before you have the blood test.  Then adjust your dose so your 25(OH)D level is between 50 and 70 ng/ml, summer and winter.  These are conservative dosage recommendations.  Most people who avoid the sun - and virtually all dark-skinned people - will have to increase their dose once they find their blood level is still low, even after two months of the above dosage, especially in the winter.

20:11:04&nbsp;
kristina
The Vitamin D we offer is excellent, Bio-D-Mulsion Forte? - 1 fl oz.

20:11:23&nbsp;
sue b
well, he was deficient and his doc just said 1000 a day

20:11:31&nbsp;
sue b
he weighs only 115 lbs though

20:11:42&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, Sue, understandably. I have heard some doctors say that they are finding as many as 90-95 percent of their clients are low in Vitamin D.

20:11:50&nbsp;
sue b
wowswers

20:11:58&nbsp;
sue b
i read up on it a bit and it can cause muscle aches

20:12:02&nbsp;
sue b
of which i have :(

20:12:31&nbsp;
kristina
I think with its connections to heart disease, diabetes, cancer and bone loss, we all need to be having our Vitamin D tested after we supplement for a bit and then continually monitoring our Vitamin D throughout the years.

20:12:45&nbsp;
sue b
you can't really take too much, is that correct?

20:12:52&nbsp;
sue b
and should we multi-dose?

20:12:57&nbsp;
kristina
Of course, I do ask that everyone gets a good dose of sunshine as often as they are able to, without getting sunburned, ever.

20:12:58&nbsp;
pat e
I thought that &quot;D&quot; was suppose to be the &quot;Sunshine!!&quot; vitamin??

20:13:21&nbsp;
Jesse R.
I get my vitamin D with the citracal I take daily for osteoporosis.  I also take the 70 mg dose of fosomax 1x weekly.

20:13:25&nbsp;
sue b
i looked up vitamin d foods and i eat almost none of them and work indoors at my computer all day so i am sure i am deficient

20:13:26&nbsp;
Dave
Sue, New England sun not as intense, so supplement would help. Just a guess. 

20:13:41&nbsp;
michael b
are there any foods really rich in &quot;D&quot;.

20:13:44&nbsp;
sue b
yes Dave i am sure...here in texas we get real sun ;)

20:13:53&nbsp;
John B
A N.D. here in Okla. has tested about 250 people of all ages, mostly older however, and only about 8 have passed with minimum.

20:14:01&nbsp;
sue b
that is amazing John

20:14:09&nbsp;
Jesse R.
As we do on the &quot;left coast of FL&quot;

20:14:14&nbsp;
sue b
what took them so long to figure this out?

20:14:22&nbsp;
sue b
maybe less people drink vit a enriched milk?

20:14:37&nbsp;
kristina
Mostly that is true, but do follow your doctor's advice on retesting for the Vitamin D.

20:14:49&nbsp;
sue b
she didn't wanna see my son for a year

20:14:55&nbsp;
sue b
i told him to go sooner

20:15:07&nbsp;
sue b
maybe 6 months tops

20:15:12&nbsp;
Jesse R.
Very interesting, John.  I spent my first 46 yrs. in OK

20:15:18&nbsp;
kristina
However, one does need to be thoughtful of their choices for Vitamin D supplementation. For instance, Cod liver oil contains toxic amounts of vitamin A.  Vitamin A antagonizes the action of vitamin D.  Stay tuned to the press.  In several months you will see a clear warning by numerous experts not to take vitamin A or cod liver oil.

20:15:35&nbsp;
sue b
right, i just read about that

20:15:37&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, D is the sunshine Vitamin.

20:15:48&nbsp;
sue b
a friend wanted to take the cod liver and i suggested not due to high vit a dose

20:16:17&nbsp;
sue b
 crazy how things change..my mom used to take cod liver oil many moons ago

20:16:47&nbsp;
John B
I am 67 and last year in August I made sure I got a mimimum of 20 to 30 minutes of early sun with only ball cap, shoes and skimpy shorts.  I was pretty well tanned and only had a Vit D level of 33.

20:16:49&nbsp;
kristina
More information on cardiovascular disease and D

20:16:54&nbsp;
Jesse R.
I was given cod liver oil as a child.  I absolutely hated it!

20:17:07&nbsp;
sue b
John, did your doc say wh?

20:17:07&nbsp;
sue b
why?

20:17:12&nbsp;
kristina
Vitamin D and blood pressure

20:17:36&nbsp;
michael b
will vit. D get past sun block? 

20:17:50&nbsp;
sue b
i think sun block is just for uv rays

20:17:55&nbsp;
kristina
John, did you supplement? Were you retested?

20:18:07&nbsp;
kristina
Animal products are the main sources of Vitamin D foods.

20:18:10&nbsp;
sue b
john -- did your doc say why you were low? what causes that?

20:18:11&nbsp;
John B
I do have cancer and possibly that could have been a contributing factor.

20:18:17&nbsp;
Dave
Kris, wasn't cod liver oil once a must for babies/toddlers? Probably got it like it or not - like an enema lol. &gt;

20:18:24&nbsp;
michael b
thanks sue.

20:18:39&nbsp;
sue b
I am sorry to hear that John, does the doctor think that is why?

20:18:41&nbsp;
kristina
However, it is real tough to get enough D with just food, especially as one ages. 

20:18:47&nbsp;
Jesse R.
I have cancer too, John.  Good luck to you.

20:18:50&nbsp;
sue b
my son's endo said he is just a &quot;poor converter&quot; from the sun

20:19:12&nbsp;
kristina
Sunblock does limit the amount of Vitamin D that your body is able to make.

20:19:26&nbsp;
sue b
that is good to know i would not have thought it would...

20:19:39&nbsp;
kristina
vitamin D and autoimmune diseases

20:20:22&nbsp;
kristina
Just so you all know, as of today, our Live Chats 2008 are all posted on the website. This one will also be on the website within a day or two so don't worry about getting these links down and all the other good information.

20:20:42&nbsp;
sue b
ok good, ty

20:20:55&nbsp;
Jesse R.
Great to know!  Thanks so much, Kristina.

20:21:11&nbsp;
kristina
One more thing.  Everyone has different vitamin D machinery.  For example, regular run-of-the-mill rickets does not require much vitamin D to be cured.  However, two other forms of rickets, both rare, one caused by a defective vitamin D receptor and the other by a malfunction of the enzyme that activates vitamin D, requires either much more vitamin D or activated vitamin D (calcitriol) itself.  It seems likely that there is as much variation in the amount and functionality of the enzyme that activates vitamin D as there is in the vitamin D receptor.  Furthermore, there are probably tissue variations as well.  That is, one vitamin D deficient child gets rickets, another autism, another asthma, and yet another type-1 diabetes because functionality of the vitamin D machinery is genetically variable both between children and within children''s tissues.  Therefore, some people, who have genetically determined decreased functionality of the machinery in different tissues, will need more vitamin D.  How much more, we do not know.  However, should you have a child with autism, they will usually need more than a normal child to overcome their genetic defects.  None of what I say in this last paragraph has been proven, it is theoretical.

20:21:35&nbsp;
John B
I took 25 drops (400 I.U./drop) of Xymogen brand liquid drops once in morning and once in evening for a total of 50 drops/day.  I took this for 3 months and brought my level up to 42.  I then took 100 drops/day and increased my Vit D level to 74.3 in 3/08.

20:21:47&nbsp;
sue b
what is a good level John?

20:21:51&nbsp;
kristina
How much vitamin D you need varies with age, body weight, percent of body fat, latitude, skin coloration, season of the year, use of sunblock, individual variation in sun exposure, and - probably - how ill your are.  As a general rule, old people need more than young people, big people need more that little people, fat people need more than skinny people, southern people need more than northern people, dark-skinned people need more than fair-skinned people, winter people need more than summer people, sunblock lovers need more than sunblock haters, sun-phobes need more than sun worshipers, and ill people may need more than well people.

20:21:57&nbsp;
kristina
You are welcome.

20:22:36&nbsp;
Dave
Sorry that the message board has died, but guess I understand with lack of contributions.

20:23:19&nbsp;
kristina
Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that is essential for maintaining normal calcium metabolism (1). Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) can be synthesized by humans in the skin upon exposure to ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation from sunlight, or it can be obtained from the diet.

20:23:42&nbsp;
sue b
when you say vit d is fat soluable, does fat-soluble mean best taken with food?

20:24:24&nbsp;

Thanks, Dave. It was time as I was never able to tend to it. I am thinking of having a weekly live chat, though.

20:26:45&nbsp;
Dave
Be happy if that happened.

20:26:48&nbsp;
kristina
What is the ideal level of 25(OH)D?

20:26:58&nbsp;
kristina
We don''t know.  However, thanks to Bruce Hollis, Robert Heaney, Neil Binkley, and others, we now know the minimal acceptable level.  It is 50 ng/ml.  In a recent study, Heaney et al enlarged on Bruce Hollis''s seminal work by analyzing five studies in which both the parent compound, cholecalciferol, and 25(OH)D levels were measured. It turn out that the body does not reliably begin storing the parent compound (cholecalciferol) in fat and muscle tissue until 25(OH)D levels get above 50 ng/ml.  The average person starts to store cholecalciferol at 40 ng/ml, but at 50 ng/ml, virtually everyone begins to store it for future use.  That is, at levels below 50 ng/ml, the body is usually using up the vitamin D as fast as you make it or take it, indicating chronic substrate starvation, not a good thing.    Hollis BW, Wagner CL, Drezner MK, Binkley NC. Circulating vitamin D3 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D in humans: An important tool to define adequate nutritional vitamin D status. J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol. 2007 Mar;103(3-5):631-4.

20:27:09&nbsp;
John B
The N.D. I listen to on radio out of Edmond, OK, says 75 is a good level for those with health problems.  150 is considered toxic.  I have been taking about 50 drops (400 I.U.) daily Dr.Hulda Clark's Vit. D since June got a report back today--it was 98.

20:27:51&nbsp;
michael b
these chats have so much information,thanks again,kristina.

20:28:05&nbsp;
kristina
You are very welcome, Michael.

20:28:22&nbsp;
kristina
If I have missed anything that anyone has asked or pondered, let me know.

20:28:32&nbsp;
sue b
does fat-soluble mean best taken with food?

20:28:45&nbsp;
Jesse R.
I know this is probably time you really do not have available, and I do appreciate it and the information, Kristina.

20:28:47&nbsp;
Dave
Is cod liver oil even available easily today?

20:29:25&nbsp;
kristina
Fat soluble vitamins are mostly found in fatty foods and fish-liver oils and are particularly rich in vitamins A and D. A certain amount of fat is needed in the diet to help the body absorb these vitamins.

20:29:44&nbsp;
sue b
so take in middle of meal?

20:29:47&nbsp;
michael b
i have fairly light skin, so i try to take care of it.

20:29:54&nbsp;
kristina
soluble in fats

20:30:42&nbsp;
kristina
The fat soluble vitamins are absorbed from the terminal ileum, and so pathology at this location can lead to their deficiency (e.g. ileal resection, Crohn's disease). They can also become deficient in poor diets, malabsorption (e.g. cystic fibrosis) and obstructive jaundice (bile is required in the duodenum/ileum to facilitate fat absorption).

20:31:04&nbsp;
Lisa
Hi everyone! I just got finished teaching, so I can join in on the last half!

20:31:11&nbsp;
michael b
hey Lisa, glad you could make it.

20:31:13&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, Sue, take your Vitamin D supplement in the middle of your meal.

20:31:19&nbsp;
sue b
ok, ty :)

20:31:48&nbsp;
Lisa
I bet many members are sad to see the forum go!!

20:31:51&nbsp;
kristina
Oh, yes, Cod Liver Oil is very popular in the alternative health movement.

20:33:02&nbsp;
Dave
Kris: On other subjects raised earlier: worth of chiropractic? Told many are pro-colon therapy too?

20:33:23&nbsp;
kristina
A good chiropractor is worth their weight in gold.

20:33:44&nbsp;
Dave
pull up a chair, Lisa and see previous!

20:34:11&nbsp;
Jesse R.
Dave, I am blessed with a DO who does manipulative work for me, but the chiropractor I used to see endorses colon therapy, as does my DO.

20:34:13&nbsp;
kristina
Another link that I wanted to bring to your attention is a Washington Post article about the work of Sally Fallon.

20:34:18&nbsp;
michael b
would Cod Liver oil be good rubbed on ones body, not digested?

20:34:37&nbsp;
sue b
i got locked and booted up, sorry if i my question was sketchy

20:35:38&nbsp;
kristina
Her work is inspired by the late Dr. Weston A. Price. The article states, &quot;His 1939 book, &quot;Nutrition and Physical Degeneration,&quot; concluded that a diet high in the vitamins found in animal fats and untouched by &quot;modern&quot; innovations such as refined flour, sugar and chemically preserved foods was the key to preventing chronic disease and tooth decay.&quot;

20:35:45&nbsp;
John B
Jesse R., sorry to hear you are also dealing with cancer--mine is prostate, what is yours?  Best wishes!

20:36:07&nbsp;
michael b
Sally gave your book a  really good reveiw.

20:36:33&nbsp;
Jesse R.
Prostate, as well, John.  18 mo. ago we thought we had a cure, but it looks like I have the beginning of a recurrent problem.

20:36:49&nbsp;
kristina
I think Cod Liver Oil would not be a good choice to rub on your body. I would recommend using coconut oil on the skin.

20:36:58&nbsp;
Dave
This guy is a colonic &quot;getter,&quot; so I guess that is good endorsement, LOL.

20:38:00&nbsp;
kristina
Hi, Lisa. The chats are now all posted on the website. 2008 Live Chat Transcripts 

20:38:14&nbsp;
michael b
is there vit. D in coconut oil. 

20:38:19&nbsp;
kristina
This chat will be online yet this week so you will be able to read it in its entirety.

20:38:53&nbsp;
John B
Jesse--have you heard of Bill Henderson's newsletter regarding using baking soda with maple syrup for treatment?

20:39:19&nbsp;
kristina
You will want to supplement Vitamin D orally, Michael

20:39:37&nbsp;
Lisa
Thanks Kris. I'll be sure to read them.

20:39:51&nbsp;
Jesse R.
No I have not, John.  Thanks for the heads up.  Presently, it looks like late-year radiation/hormonal or possible chemo.

20:39:56&nbsp;
kristina
There is no Vitamin D in coconut oil.

20:40:33&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, my book Ten Days to Optimal Health is similar to her book, Nourishing Traditions in many ways. You will also find the review on that link.

20:41:29&nbsp;
Lisa
I have Nourishing Traditions. Great book!

20:41:34&nbsp;
Dave
Lisa, previous tat logd now available too.

20:41:57&nbsp;
michael b
i think I need to get more Vitamin D from you. 

20:42:19&nbsp;
John B
Kristina, I cannot remember if you said no website sharing information at the beginning.

20:42:24&nbsp;
kristina
More on Price and Vitamin D:

20:42:26&nbsp;
kristina
He concluded that what those diets had in common were high levels of vitamins A and D and what he called &quot;activator X,&quot; now believed to be vitamin K2. He determined that those important vitamins could be obtained only from animal foods, including seafood, organ meats, and butterfat and eggs from pastured animals. Price, who died in 1948, got some early attention for his work, but its message was largely forgotten during the pro-industry '50s and '60s. 

20:42:43&nbsp;
Dave
sorry garble: previous logs now available.

Just start next time with the format. Thanks for putting your attention to this detail.

20:45:17&nbsp;
kristina
good idea, Michael.

20:46:06&nbsp;
kristina
Given that it is summertime for most of you, I hope that you are enjoying some daily sun.

20:46:24&nbsp;
sue b

Very easy to do in FL.  I just have to be very careful with my very light skin.

More on Vitamin D:

20:47:57&nbsp;
kristina
A report from the Office of Dietary Supplements of the National Institutes of Health concluded there is currently not enough evidence to recommend a specific upper limit of serum 25(OH)D that would indicate vitamin D sufficiency; although many US experts consider 75 nmol/L 25(OH)D is optimal, while several experts in Europe believe that 50 nmol/L 25(OH)D is adequate.  Michael Holick, considered one of the world?s leading researchers on vitamin D agrees that 75 nmol/L (30ng/mL) ?is required to maximize vitamin D's beneficial effects for health?.   Using this as a target, what dose of vitamin D is needed to reach this target in most patients? A recent study from the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition [Link] examined what the optimal dose of vitamin D would need to be in order to raise serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels to greater than 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL) without exceeding 220 nmol/L (88ng/mL). This study was a 6 month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolling 138 healthy men (n=26) and women (n=112) ages 18-65.  The initial doses of vitamin D were determined from baseline vitamin D status.  Those individuals with a 25(OH)D baseline concentration between 50-80 nmol/L were given 50 &#956;g/day of vitamin D3 (2000 IU) and those with a baseline concentration below 50 nmol/L were given 100 &#956;g/day of vitamin D3 (4000 IU).  The patients were followed at 8 week intervals and the dose was subsequently adjusted after each visit.  Doses were increased or decreased in 50 &#956;g or 20 &#956;g increments.  The mean daily dose given was 86 &#956;g/day (3440 IU) of vitamin D3.

Jesse R.,  Look up www.beating-cancer-gently.com.  Go to newsletter archives and look at March 12, 2008 for baking soda/maple syrup info.  I am currently trying this therapy--started 3 weeks ago.

20:48:21&nbsp;

Is it just me, re Post article, that alternatives are becoming OK for &quot;polite society?&quot; Enemas and colon hydrrotherapy next?

20:48:46&nbsp;
Jesse R.
Thanks so much, John B.

Sue, needed medical tests really depend on the individual, their age and their overall health.

20:49:39&nbsp;
sue b
right, but now everyone should do D is that correct?

20:49:48&nbsp;
sue b
wondering if anything else we should ask about...

20:50:01&nbsp;
kristina
Of course, I do recommend the Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis and the Adrenal Stress Index Test on a seasonal basis.

20:50:10&nbsp;
sue b
i get that :)

20:50:57&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, everyone needs to go to their doctor and have their Vitamin D levels monitored. However, I do recommend that people start taking Vitamin D, as I stated earlier, as soon as they are able to.

20:51:23&nbsp;
kristina
Sue, do you mean with your medical doctor?

20:51:29&nbsp;
sue b

i just hope docs are open to this -- and don't see it as yet another invasion into their territory

20:52:12&nbsp;
sue b
i feel i am always asking/telling my doc what to test for 

20:52:25&nbsp;
sue b
not that i mind...;)

20:53:13&nbsp;
kristina
I hear you, Sue.

20:54:12&nbsp;
kristina
There is a lot of reading material on that internet that can help you, as well as on www.westonaprice.org to assist you with discussing these issues with your doctor.

Other lab tests are trickier to talk about. I will think about this good question and address it at the next live chat. We can also talk about it tomorrow in our phone consultation.

20:55:52&nbsp;
sue b
ok i appreciate it. i have lab work coming up in about 10 days

20:55:52&nbsp;
kristina
We are just about out of time. Any last minute questions? I have thoroughly enjoyed today's live chat. Thanks everyone for being here.

20:55:56&nbsp;

Kristina, do you recommend colon cleansing before hernia repair in the groin area.

20:56:16&nbsp;
kristina
We have a monthly live chat on the second Wednesday of each month at 7pm, CST.

20:56:20&nbsp;

I am just glad that this chiro is good for colonics and grew up when i did with usual remedies then.

20:56:25&nbsp;

Jesse R. Also, look at the previous (I believe Feb. 2008) about the DVD on MMS (Miracle Mineral Supplement).  I also started this therapy along with the baking soda/maple syrup at the same time.  A person in AR knocked out prostate/bladder cancer in 6 wks

20:56:32&nbsp;
kristina
I am considering doing a weekly or bi monthly live chat. 

20:56:54&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, I do, Michael.

20:57:00&nbsp;
Jesse R.
Thanks so much, John B.

20:57:11&nbsp;

Jesse, what therapies have you used?

20:57:32&nbsp;
kristina

20:57:48&nbsp;
Dave
will only only encourage you there, Kris next date/time?

20:58:12&nbsp;

Thanks Kristina!

I wonder how many of us actually inform our doctors that we use enemas for health or other?  I can tell you that I haven't informed mine as I'm afraid that I'll be labeled something.

20:58:31&nbsp;
Jesse R.
My cancer was detected so early and the initial PSA's post-op were so good nothing was recommended.  I do take a daily coffee enema for this and other problems.

20:58:36&nbsp;
kristina
next live chat, September 10th at 7pm. I will send out a notice if I decide to have a second chat before that with the upcoming newsletter.

20:58:49&nbsp;
Jesse R.
Thanks so much, 

20:59:33&nbsp;
