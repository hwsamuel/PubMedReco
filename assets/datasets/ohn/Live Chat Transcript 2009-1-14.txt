Hi Kris!!

19:58:56&nbsp;
kristina
Hey, how are you?

19:59:30&nbsp;
Lisa P.
I'm doing well. Lots of practicing for my Carmel, CA, gig!

19:59:44&nbsp;
kristina
Tell me more. I haven't heard about this.

20:00:22&nbsp;
kristina
Rayna has been studying the Suzuki method. I absolutely love it. We went to a weekend retreat.

20:00:40&nbsp;
Lisa P.
I sent you an email! I'll send it again. I'm performing at the Cypress owned by Doris Day! She does enemas you know!

20:01:27&nbsp;
Lisa P.
I'm glad Rayna is doing well with her music!

20:01:56&nbsp;
kristina
Sorry about not getting to that email  yet. How do you know about Doris Day using colon cleansing to optimize her health?

20:03:07&nbsp;
Lisa P.
She has talked about this. When she was 13, she got hit by a train!!! In the hospital, she was given enemas, and she loved how it felt, so she kept up this good habit.

20:03:20&nbsp;
kristina
Welcome, Bud.

20:03:36&nbsp;
kristina
Welcome, Mike.

20:03:48&nbsp;
Mike K
Hi Kris

20:03:55&nbsp;
kristina
How did she get hit by a train?

20:04:10&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Hi Bud and Mike! Just starting out with some small talk.

20:04:28&nbsp;
Mike K
Hi Lisa

20:04:39&nbsp;
Joseph
hello Kris, all

20:04:57&nbsp;
Lisa P.
She was in a car with three other people, and no one was killed! But it could have been she wouldn't walk again she's so lucky!

20:05:05&nbsp;
kristina
Hi Joseph,

20:05:35&nbsp;
kristina
This is interesting about Doris Day because I learned about using enemas from a man who was hit by a car. 

20:05:49&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Wow!

20:05:49&nbsp;
kristina
When he came out of his coma, his colon didn't function.

20:06:18&nbsp;
kristina
As he sought the advice of medical doctors, he wasn't pleased with the answers he was receiving: take harsh laxatives for the rest of his life.

20:06:49&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Smart man!

20:06:59&nbsp;
kristina
He continue his quest for bowel health and found a medical doctor in Colorado that guided him to daily enemas, which he has been taking all these years, with continually good health.

20:07:32&nbsp;
kristina
I feel blessed because it was through him that I started my internet business selling enema equipment.

20:07:48&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Amazing story!

20:08:06&nbsp;
kristina
Okay, please do share your colon cleanse and related health stories. The topic that I want to advance tonight is heavy metal toxicity.

20:08:18&nbsp;
Mike K
A lot of paralyzed people use that method

20:09:23&nbsp;
kristina
Heavy metals are contaminating our food, water and health supplements for animals and man. The major source is chemical pollution by agribusiness, industry and the public dumping of toxic household wastes in landfills. All these metals upset the mineral balance in the body. 

20:09:37&nbsp;
kristina
Welcome, Tommy!

20:09:42&nbsp;
kristina
And Jumper, too.

20:09:42&nbsp;
Mike K
Their is a lot of times I feel like I have lead in my butt :-)

20:10:44&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, lots of people who are paralyzed do use the colon cleanse daily. I have worked with many and they always feel so much better when they can move their bowels daily.

20:10:51&nbsp;
Joseph
isn't mercury more of a problem in the Great Lakes water?

20:10:52&nbsp;
kristina
Lead in the butt?

20:11:32&nbsp;
Mike K
 Ya, lead butt 

20:12:05&nbsp;
Mike K
Means you move slow!

20:12:08&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Lance Armstrong dumped toxic chemicals in an Austin lake. We are angry at him here!

20:12:14&nbsp;
kristina
The most common way people are exposed to any form of mercury is by eating fish containing methyl mercury. Other exposures include breaking products containing elemental mercury and using compounds that contain mercury.

20:12:24&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, there is A LOT of mercury in the Great Lakes.

20:12:44&nbsp;
tommy w
Hi Tommy here - first time - ??  I had an astronomy class this evening that was canceled for lack of interest - :(  Otherwise - Enemas - My wife is thinking coffee enemas are weird - !!  

20:13:11&nbsp;
kristina
Mercury and PCBs are the contaminants of greatest concern in Wisconsin's fish. To reduce people's exposure to these contaminants, the state provides advice to help you choose what fish and how much fish to eat.

20:13:14&nbsp;
kristina
Welcome, Billy

20:13:28&nbsp;
kristina
Oh, I get it.

20:13:38&nbsp;
kristina
I guess I am a bit slow on the jokes. LOL

20:14:00&nbsp;
Joseph
:) 

20:14:03&nbsp;
billythekid
Nice to be here.

20:14:05&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, lots of people think all sorts of enemas are weird.

20:14:30&nbsp;
Bud F
bbb

20:14:39&nbsp;
Mike K
I think they are mostly just embarrassed about it

20:15:45&nbsp;
kristina
Hello, Michael.

20:15:56&nbsp;
kristina
Hello Lori

20:16:11&nbsp;
lori
hi all

20:16:21&nbsp;
Joseph
hi lori

20:16:26&nbsp;
lori
hi...

20:16:29&nbsp;
Mike K
Ever notice how some people will talk about other people's bowel functions but never their own

20:16:32&nbsp;
kristina
This information is not intended to discourage people from eating fish but just guiding them on how much, from what bodies of water and what types of fish.

20:16:56&nbsp;
kristina
One of my goals is to reduce the amount of mercury that is in the environment.

20:17:13&nbsp;
tommy w
I have started some of the coffee enemas but not enough time to notice any difference.  My health has been quite good and at 64 I feel happy about that.  Honesty -  I believe in some honesty so - The enema idea sounds like a healthy thing but doctors don't

20:17:36&nbsp;
kristina
Back to the broader topic of heavy metals:

20:18:33&nbsp;
tommy w
I seem to not know how much I can enter and then it hangs up here - ??

20:18:36&nbsp;
kristina
Hair analysis can detect and measure the content of heavy metals and minerals of the hair. This applies to animals and people.

20:18:51&nbsp;
kristina
The Global Environmental Monitoring System (GEMS) of the United Nations Environment Program selected human hair as one of the important monitoring materials for worldwide biological monitoring of pollution.

20:18:56&nbsp;
kristina
Welcome, Katy

20:19:13&nbsp;
Katy
Thank you, sorry I'm late

20:19:21&nbsp;
jumper
Following up on Mike's comment, I recently had a colonoscopy and was required to take one of these oral Golightly drinks.  I asked the doctor if I could do just an old-fashioned high colonic, and you would have thought that I had asked for something impolite.

20:19:43&nbsp;
Mike K
so how do you know that the fish you bought at the store is safe to eat?

20:19:56&nbsp;
michael b
watching the weather reports in wisconsin, brrrrr, so stay warm, and hello.

20:20:31&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Hope all of you are staying warm. It was sunny and 60 here!

20:20:45&nbsp;
kristina
I work with folks all the time who do better with a good old-fashioned high enema to have a colonoscopy. The client always reports that the colon was cleared out well.

20:20:59&nbsp;
billythekid
Even down here in New Orleans it is very, very cold

20:21:04&nbsp;
Mike K
Sun just went down and it's 82?

20:21:05&nbsp;
kristina
I know of many people who get sick for days from the prep drinks for the colonoscopy 

20:21:23&nbsp;
kristina
Very good question, Mike.

20:21:24&nbsp;
lori
Ok so Christina, where are you going with the  heavy metals? 

20:21:59&nbsp;
lori
are we focusing on one topic tonight or are people just asking random questions?

20:22:13&nbsp;
lori
this is my first chat group with you...

20:22:27&nbsp;
kristina
The website I use is www.organicconsumers.org

20:22:43&nbsp;
Mike K
lori, heavy metals 

20:23:08&nbsp;
kristina
www.montereybayaquarium.org/cr/seafoodwatch.aspx

20:23:21&nbsp;
kristina
You can even get the application for Safe Fish on your iPhone.

20:23:40&nbsp;
lori
so do we just ask questions?

20:23:48&nbsp;
kristina
Lori, I always advance a topic, which tonight is Heavy Metals and questions are always, always welcome.

20:24:03&nbsp;
kristina
On any subject related to health

20:24:23&nbsp;
lori
is anyone else CHT here? 

20:24:24&nbsp;
kristina
I am so pleased that you have joined us, Lori. Please do share all that is on your mind.

20:24:42&nbsp;
Joseph
thank you for the links, kris

20:24:51&nbsp;
michael b
in regard to eating fresh fish, farm-raised fish can be iffy? look for wild.

20:25:11&nbsp;
tommy w
Healthy discussions sounds good to me.  Oh - I am in the Minnesota area - coldddd here.  I know Kristina feels it also in Wisconsin. I wonder how I can change my wife's feelings about enemas?  I was thinking of the DVDs you have Kristina - might help.

20:25:42&nbsp;
kristina
Here is a tidbit from the Safe Fish site from the Monterey Bay Aquarium that will give you the detail that helps you decide which fish to eat: 

20:25:44&nbsp;
kristina
Health Alert Environmental Defense Fund has issued a health advisory for longline-caught albacore tuna due to elevated levels of mercury. No consumption advisories are listed for troll/pole-caught albacore as these gear methods catch younger tuna with lower mercury levels. 

20:25:55&nbsp;
lori
I just bought the DVD and yes it is VERY helpful for people who don't understand. I highly recommend it...

20:26:01&nbsp;
Lisa P.
All About Enemas is a good DVD to start with.

20:26:13&nbsp;
kristina
If your hair reveals the presence of heavy metals (arsenic, lead, mercury, aluminum, cadmium, selenium, nickel, copper and iron) this means the tissues and organs of your body contain them too. The hair is a spill over from what is in the body.

20:26:30&nbsp;
kristina
Generally heavy metals cannot be detected by blood or urine tests. Heavy metals are toxic, the severity of symptoms being related to the absolutes consumed, and the time factor involved.

20:26:33&nbsp;
Katy
Kristina, is it true that cooking goitrogenic veggies deactivates the substance that interferes with thyroid production?

20:26:49&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, this is true, Katy.

20:27:00&nbsp;
Katy
Thanks. 

20:27:05&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Kristina has some good clips on youtube also! Check it out!

20:27:29&nbsp;
kristina
Thanks, Lisa. Yes, I am very pleased about those YouTube clips.

20:28:07&nbsp;
jumper
Where on YouTube?  I don't remember hearing of this.

20:28:28&nbsp;
Lisa P.
I just typed in her name, and there it was!

20:28:28&nbsp;
kristina
Heavy Metals causing mineral imbalance can lead to the following conditions in people/ or animals: (from ?Toxic Metal in Human Health and Disease?)

20:28:45&nbsp;
tommy w
Barb - my wife - is very interested in the health food stores and the non-medical approach to her health.  Her mom died of Celiac disease - gluten - not tolerant I guess it was - Barb wonders if she could maybe inherit that - ?

20:28:50&nbsp;
kristina
Dr Paul Eck and Dr. Larry Wilson, Eck Institute of Applied Nutrition and Bioenergetics.)

20:29:04&nbsp;
kristina
Depression - toxicity with lead and aluminum

20:29:16&nbsp;
kristina
Hypoglycemia - elevations of sodium-to-potassium ratios with potassium deficiency prevents blood glucose from crossing the cell membrane and contribute to inflammations and stress. This can be associated with many heavy metals.

20:29:33&nbsp;
kristina
Aluminum toxicity lowers manganese levels that influence blood sugar disturbances.

20:30:00&nbsp;
Katy
Kris, could lots of yeast die-off from taking anti-fungals burden the gall bladder and liver? 

20:30:09&nbsp;
kristina
Those clips discuss coffee enemas, as does the home page of my website, www.optimalhealthnetwork.com

20:30:21&nbsp;
kristina
Absolutely!

20:31:01&nbsp;
kristina
Lori, what is CHT?

20:31:37&nbsp;
Katy
OK. That is when I began noticing gallbladder problems.  

20:31:48&nbsp;
kristina
Celiac Disease is often passed from generation to generation.

20:32:14&nbsp;
tommy w
Say - I noticed today that for me an enema seems a lot easier if I am on my left side.  Guess I will go with that and hope it continues to work.  Lots of time I need though before I stop &quot;dripping,&quot; which is a huge nuisance.

20:32:21&nbsp;
kristina
We do an adrenal stress index test that measure for gliadin, which is a marker from gluten intolerance that I have found incredibly useful.

20:32:46&nbsp;
kristina
Have you tried a retention nozzle?

20:33:25&nbsp;
tommy w
I am going to log off - Last chat room I was in was Hay House years ago.  A good place for the mental that is also an issue at times.  Blessings to all -w 

20:33:58&nbsp;
kristina
Louise Hay is a blessing to all of us.

20:34:14&nbsp;
kristina
I am currently working with the ideas of Bruce Lipton, PhD. 

20:34:23&nbsp;
michael b
i do wish, if it is possible, to make the downloaded (small and large enemas ) dvd.

20:34:33&nbsp;
kristina
The Biology of Belief is one of his books. 

20:34:51&nbsp;
kristina
You can also find clips on YouTube.

20:35:29&nbsp;
Katy
Sounds interesting, thanks.

20:35:45&nbsp;
kristina
It is changing my life, my work, my health, these ideas.

20:35:50&nbsp;
kristina
Back to heavy metals:

20:35:53&nbsp;
kristina
Headaches - almost all heavy metals

20:36:05&nbsp;
kristina
Hypertension - can be due to elevated sodium-to-magnesium ratio, and elevated sodium-to-potassium ratios causing edema and water retention in the body with increased blood pressure.

20:36:21&nbsp;
kristina
Many heavy metals play a role in this.

20:36:33&nbsp;
kristina
Arthritis - can be related to aluminum and lead?s relationship to calcium levels in the body. Copper is implicated in various collagen diseases and rheumatoid arthritis. Also elevated iron?s association to aluminum toxicity (?rusty? joint syndrome)

20:36:48&nbsp;
kristina
Lowered resistance to infections and healing are related to zinc deficiencies caused by toxic levels of aluminum and copper

20:36:58&nbsp;
kristina
Hair loss - selenium toxicity, and premature graying from aluminum

20:37:07&nbsp;
Joseph
how much for a hair analysis kris?

20:37:12&nbsp;
kristina
Prostate disorders - aluminum toxicity interferes with zinc metabolism necessary for the health of the prostate

20:37:30&nbsp;
kristina
$65

20:37:47&nbsp;
Joseph
thank you :D 

20:37:52&nbsp;
kristina
Cardiovascular disease can be associated with aluminum, arsenic, selenium,

20:38:16&nbsp;
Katy
Kris, when I get a scratch and bleed I notice my blood smells strongly metallic. Is that normal?

20:38:19&nbsp;
kristina
We also do hair analysis on pets. 

20:38:33&nbsp;
Katy
Oh really, how much?

20:38:57&nbsp;
Katy
The same as for humans?

20:40:01&nbsp;
kristina
I believe that blood that is high in iron tends to smell like metal.

20:40:21&nbsp;
kristina
Blood that is too high in iron can cause troubles. We like to see it on the lower side on the hair analysis.

20:40:49&nbsp;
kristina
The same price for pets as for humans.

20:41:00&nbsp;
Katy
OK, I have hair analysis kit and just haven't done it yet. 

20:42:04&nbsp;
kristina
Well, I look forward to working with you using the information from your hair. The evaulation gives us a sense of one's overall health, of health trends, and how one is managing lifestyle stressors.

20:42:41&nbsp;
kristina
It is quite a kick to view the WHOLE body at a cellular level, especially after I have been studying cellular biology with Bruce Lipton.

20:42:47&nbsp;
Katy
Kris, is it possible for candida not to show up in stool analysis if it has been there long term?

20:43:06&nbsp;
kristina
The gist of his work is WE CAN HEAL. That our genes do not determine our health!

20:43:14&nbsp;
michael b
i have meant to send you a current hair sample. it has been 3 years since my original sample. if i tried a hair sample from my cat, she would bite me. 

20:43:31&nbsp;
Joseph
I really want to do that analysis, for metal, and acidity testing

20:43:37&nbsp;
kristina
Well, Michael, I have missed you, ya know!

20:43:47&nbsp;
Joseph
lol

20:44:06&nbsp;
kristina
:D 

20:44:17&nbsp;
Lisa P.
michael, can you get a hair sample from your cat's brush?

20:46:13&nbsp;
kristina
Candida is hard to locate in stool samples. Even if it is present it may not show up

20:46:32&nbsp;
Katy
What I meant on the yeast question is that I know I've had candida since childhood but it didn't show up in Comp. Stool Analysis test as an adult. I hear it can build a protective shell around itself.

20:47:13&nbsp;
Joseph
smart Lisa!

20:47:31&nbsp;
Katy
Sometimes when I do enemas, chunks of white evacuate with the water.

20:48:03&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Thanks Joseph! Maybe a flea comb will work too!

20:48:45&nbsp;
kristina
The stool analysis that we use looks at uses gut immunity and intestinal function markers to evaluate irritation and inflammation

20:49:11&nbsp;
kristina
If theses markers indicate overall status of gut immunity and integrity to be low, it is likely that one has a candida overgrowth.

20:49:12&nbsp;
Katy
OK, how much does that cost?

20:49:29&nbsp;
kristina
or too high

20:50:00&nbsp;
kristina
We have two different tests that can be found here

20:50:12&nbsp;
Katy
Thanks

20:50:19&nbsp;
kristina
Gastrointestinal Health Panel - $215

20:50:30&nbsp;

I think you are looking for the basic test.

20:51:35&nbsp;
Katy
I'll check out the links, thanks

20:51:47&nbsp;
kristina
You are welcome.

20:53:02&nbsp;
Joseph
yes, thank you so much for all of your information kris, you are a true inspiration!

20:53:09&nbsp;
kristina
Have I missed anything?

20:53:20&nbsp;
kristina
Well, thank you so very much, Joseph. 

20:53:25&nbsp;
michael b
as it gets colder, i'll bet you think of belize.

20:53:34&nbsp;
Katy
Kris, I look forward to having you access my health and make suggestions.

20:54:07&nbsp;
kristina
Even though it has been tough to work through my own health problems, it is a blessing to be able to share what I have learned and to assist others towards a greater quality of life.

20:54:46&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, I have a tote bag that I carry around that says Belize. I miss it, lots. I sure would like to go back someday. It looks like schools will be closed here tomorrow because it is so cold.

20:54:49&nbsp;
Katy
Experience can be a better teacher than training but both are BETTER

20:56:09&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, both of fabulous.

20:56:36&nbsp;
kristina
One of my weekend workshops is coming up in a few weeks. I will be attending another Janet Lang seminar.

20:57:20&nbsp;
kristina
It is called Balancing Thyroid, Adrenals and Blood Sugar Naturally.

20:57:29&nbsp;
kristina
This seminar focuses on essential therapeutic concepts to approach thyroid, adrenal, and blood sugar imbalances in a natural, effective, and non-invasive manner.

20:57:47&nbsp;
kristina
Practitioners will learn to &quot;follow the physiology&quot; and identify the source of the gland and understand the adrenal glands and their many functions.

20:57:54&nbsp;
Katy
OOOOh, sounds good

20:58:00&nbsp;
kristina
Differentiate the phases of the adrenal stress response (alarm phase, &quot;prolonged stress response&quot;/resistance phase, and exhaustion phase), which are symptomatically similar, yet require different strategies.

20:58:10&nbsp;
kristina
Understand the relationship between adrenal and thyroid function and dysfunction, and why you often cannot resolve one without addressing the other.

20:58:24&nbsp;
kristina
Find out how adrenal problems are often the stage upon which degenerative diseases begin, and what can be done about it.

20:58:35&nbsp;
kristina
The thyroid gland, its functions, and related hormones are discussed. Learn why this gland produces as many psychological and emotional symptoms as physical ones. Identify both hypo- and hyper-thyroid issues in their earliest stages.

20:58:45&nbsp;
michael b
i am still most amazed, at so many ways you keep finding to get healthier.  

20:58:48&nbsp;
kristina
Find out why this gland so often resists even the best of treatments, and what to do about it. 

20:58:59&nbsp;
kristina
Examine the Brain-Hypothalamus-Pituitary (HP Axis) coordination of thyroid and adrenal hormone production. 

20:59:08&nbsp;
kristina
Understanding this correlation and control system is vital to successful correction of thyroid and adrenal dysfunction.

20:59:27&nbsp;
Katy
I recently started taking l-tyrosine and B-6 and my energy, brain and over all strength are better. 

21:00:08&nbsp;
kristina
Well, I hope to hear from all of you soon, and look for our next newsletter in a week or so. We will have our next Live Chat on February 11th.

21:00:40&nbsp;
Katy
Great, thanks Kris

21:00:42&nbsp;
