good afternoon, deedee. are you running the chat today?

12:56:38
michael b
the news reports say the weather is not so good at all in the midwest.

12:57:51
Dee Dee
hello, i am running the chat today.  kristina is on her way to n carolina to visit her son  - i was just warming up some good enema coffee for my chat.

12:58:51
Dee Dee
We are experiencing very windy conditions here and the temp has gone down quite a bit also.

12:59:02
michael b
what is your weather like in madison?

12:59:39
Dee Dee
How are things by you?

13:01:09
Dee Dee
We are starting some new and very exciting things here at OHN.  I have been working closely with a friend of ours who is an acupuncturist and we are beginning to use essential oils (Young Living) in our treatments.

13:01:46
michael b
this is great, to have you answer the questions before i ask them. it is really windy and rainy here.   

13:04:19
Dee Dee
Essential oils have several advantages over other supplements.  Essential oils are the life source of the plant and carry the highest healing frequency of all supplements.  When properly processed, therapeutic grade essential oils are safe to drink, apply to 

13:05:25
Dee Dee
the skin, and implant into the colon.  These oils are highly effective because their nutrients are readily assimilated on a cellular level, bypassing normal digestion.

13:06:22
michael b
with your info, i became most aware of young living. they seem right on top of everything with oils.

13:06:32
susanb
what oils do you recommend for someone with a chronic constipation problem?

13:06:39
Dee Dee
We will be testing the acupuncture alarm points on the body to ensure the most appropriate oils to use on a particular person.

13:08:16
Dee Dee
So, the answer to your question, susanb, is that it could be very unique to you.  Some oils are well known to be cleansing oils, like citrus oils...lemon, orange, etc., but peppermint can be very stimulating to the colon.

13:08:53
Dee Dee
It kind of depends on what we feel may be causing the constipation and how you as an individual respond to the different oils when tested.

13:09:22
Dee Dee
Welcome ted.  

13:09:33
ted
thanks. new here.

13:09:40
Dee Dee
great!

13:09:50
Dee Dee
anything you are wanting to ask?

13:10:12
ted
hmmm. not sure. thought i'd see what people were talking about.

13:10:41
Dee Dee
We will be teaching people how to test their own alarm points so that we can continue to help people from a distance.

13:11:56
ted
ok, i do have a couple questions...

13:12:08
ted
as i'm new to enemas

13:12:15
Dee Dee
For example, the oil thieves is a blend of highly antiviral, antiseptic, antibacterial, anti-infectious oil.  This one may be good if the person is experiencing yeast overgrowth, or a skin fungus, etc.

13:12:31
Dee Dee
ask away

13:13:05
susanb
Which oils are in this blend?

13:14:22
ted
i've been using your products. soap, coffee, bag, and enema tube. i think mine is 32&quot;. Is it possible for this to go too far in? and when i do an enema series, do i start high in the colon, or start lower and work higher?

13:14:28
Dee Dee
Thieves has clove, lemon, cinnamon bark, eucalyptus, and rosemary.  It smells wonderful and also makes a great household cleaner that is non-toxic.

13:15:49
Dee Dee
You can do your first enema lower, to clean out the lower portion of the colon first, then it will be easier to work your way up and get water higher for a more thorough cleanse.  You can go up as far as is comfortable with your colon tube.

13:16:30
Dee Dee
You never want to force the tube, but rather work it in slowly, and add small amounts of water as you go to help and open up the colon for easier insertion.

13:17:28
Dee Dee
Michael, you have worked with the colon tubes. Do you find them easy to insert and what technique do you use?

13:17:39
ted
i'm feeling more comfortable with the process. sometimes though it seems to take quite some time for me to be able to expel all of the water. is that normal?

13:19:06
Dee Dee
Another great oil that we will be using is called valor  -  it is a blend of rosewood, blue tansy, frankincense, and spruce.  This is great for pain and stress relief.  It is also great for treating inflammation.

13:19:45
Shirley B
Hello

13:20:04
Dee Dee
Sometimes it does take awhile to expel.  Try using 1 tsp. to 1 Tbsp. of Celtic Sea Salt per quart of water.  This will help your body to expel more quickly.

13:20:13
Dee Dee
welcome shirley

13:21:20
susanb
Do you know if it is helpful to add a probiotic powder to enemas?

13:21:59
michael b
i have found aloe gel great for lube.

13:22:59
Shirley B
I am on the SCD diet. Will coffee enemas interfere with my trying to build up the good bacteria in my gut?

13:23:03
Dee Dee
Probiotics - we use a powdered Bifidobacterium bifidum as an implant after a good cleanse.  This will help replenish the flora in the colon.

13:23:19
Dee Dee
Welcome, Charles.

13:23:42
Dee Dee
Yes, aloe gel is a great slippery lube that can assist in inserting the colon tube.

13:24:24
Charles N
Thanks. Sorry I'm late.

13:24:59
Dee Dee
No, coffee enemas will not interfere, but it would be great to do an implant of probiotic after the coffee enema for general replenishing.

13:25:30
Shirley B
Do you sell the implant you mention?

13:25:40
Dee Dee
Yes we do.  It is on our  website and the manufacturer of it is Natren.

13:25:56
michael b
Is this valor oil available from OHN?

13:26:07
Charles N
Are standing enemas using a colon tube effective?

13:26:08
Shirley B
Thanks

13:26:30
Dee Dee
Yes, valor will be available from us very, very soon.  We are still trying to get things up on the website and get prices, etc.

13:27:17
Dee Dee
Standing enemas are OK if that is your only possible way to do them.  I find lying down is more relaxing and easier for the water to fill the entire colon.

13:29:40
michael b
that is in addition to trace minerals?

13:30:07
ted
i've not yet done any implants. could you address the importance, quantity of implant, best choice, how long to hold? do i need a plug to accomplish this?

13:30:36
susanb
If you are using essential oils, olive oils, or other implants in the enema, what is the best way to clean the hose?

13:30:51
Dee Dee
The oil Panaway is a blend of wintergreen, clove, peppermint and helichrysum.   It is used to sooth nerves and localized discomfort. Also reduces inflammation.

13:31:25
Charles N
is a plug necessary to retain a large enema using a colon tube?

13:32:39
Dee Dee
Because the colon is such a highly absorbable site in the body, implants can be very effective.  Celtic Sea Salt delivers minerals. Enema coffee promotes cleansing of the gallbladder, liver and blood.

13:34:00
Dee Dee
Aloe juice and olive oil along with MSM promotes healing of joints and the mucosal lining of the colon, and probiotics will help to regulate the intestinal flora. The oils we will be using have endless possibilites for healing, so I think they will be absolutely great for everything.

13:35:18
Dee Dee
When you take in a large enema, you will not be holding that too long, so a plug will probably not be necessary.  You can expel that on the toilet shorly after taking it in.

13:35:47
Dee Dee
Where the plug comes in handy is when you are taking these smaller implants that you need to hold longer.  The plug, for some people, helps you to hold the implant longer.

13:37:19
Dee Dee
I think for implanting the oils, using our implant syringe with tube will be the better option and easier to clean.  Hot soapy water will probably be best.  We may look into something that will clean those oils better.

13:37:34
Dee Dee
I use Basic H at home for removing grease and oils from dishes, counters, etc.  That may work very well.

13:38:53
Dee Dee
The length of time for holding each implant will be different, depending on the result you are trying to achieve.  Coffee is held for 15 minutes, but you would want to hold many of these oil implants for a long time - until they naturally come out with your next bowel movement.

13:39:31
Shirley B
I use straight white vinegar for grease on the kitchen counters. Would that be suitable for the colon tubes?

13:39:33
Dee Dee
  Much of that will be absorbed through the colon walls and into the system by then, which is what we want.

13:40:30
Dee Dee
Yes, you could definitely use vinegar on your colon tube.

13:41:43
Dee Dee
If i missed someone's question, please let me know  - it is hard to keep track sometimes.

13:42:12
Shirley B
If a person is allergic to aloe vera taken by mouth, would it still be a problem as an implant?

13:42:22
ted
ok. Right now I do an enema series 1 per week - every other week. I do allow the coffee to &quot;steep&quot; in me for about 15 min., while lying down (couldn't resist the coffee pun). Are the other implants about 1 qt? 1 pint?

13:42:47
Dee Dee
Yes, it could very well be.  what type of reaction do you get?

13:43:07
Shirley B
Intestinal cramping

13:43:34
Dee Dee
It then may also cause cramping when placed in the colon too.

13:43:45
Shirley B
Thank you

13:44:02
Dee Dee
The other implants would be quite a bit smaller, maybe a couple of ounces to a cup or so.

13:44:33
susanb
Do you implant the essentials oils mixed with something else? Olive oil?

13:45:09
Dee Dee
Yes, you can use a carrier oil like olive oil or coconut oil.

13:46:31
Dee Dee
I will be putting drops of essential oil right into the hose of the colonic system after cleansing and following it with a small amount of water.

13:46:35
Shirley B
Will bleaching my hair with food grade peroxide affect the hair analysis results?

13:47:44
Dee Dee
You would want to wait until about 10 washes after bleaching the hair.  Also, if you take by the neck underneath, you may get less processed hair for the sample.

13:48:13
Shirley B
Thanks

13:49:06
michael b
you are doing just fine, DeeDee. I have been reading wheat grass implants. I can't help but wonder about allergies to grass.

13:50:44
Dee Dee
Yes, 3% of all people are allergic to any kind of grasses.

13:51:36
Dee Dee
I have heard of a woman's face swelling after taking a wheat grass implant.

13:53:13
michael b
My cat eats grass, but sometimes throws it up.

13:55:15
Dee Dee
Yes, many times animals (my dog) will eat grass if she has an upset stomach and this will make them throw up.  They must know this instinctively.  I have also heard of people getting nauseous after taking wheat grass.

13:55:38
Dee Dee
We digress!

13:56:15
Dee Dee
We have about 5 more minutes. Does anyone have a question they'd like to ask?

13:57:28
Dee Dee
Keep watching the website for more info on the essential oils and other implants we will be offering.

13:57:37
ted
ok, so holding the implant. what's the bottom line on how long to hold it?

13:57:53
Dee Dee
which implant do you have in mind?

13:58:18
ted
well, i'm not sure. something healthy for my gi tract after a cleansing and coffee.

13:58:31
ted
something good for hemorrhoids

14:00:16
Dee Dee
olive oil - 1/4 to 1/2 cup and equal amount of aloe juice, with 3 capsules of MSM opened into it.  Hold for about an hour if possible, or just let it come out with the next bowel movement.

14:00:31
Dee Dee
Do not pass gas unless you are on the toilet because it will probably be oil coming out and will be very messy!

14:00:58
ted
hmm. sounds like a plug may be necessary for a beginner.

14:01:09
ted
thanks for your help today

14:01:12
Shirley B
Very interesting chat. Thank you!

14:01:35
Dee Dee
Yes, you could definitely use the plug for this one.  Use the silicone one only when using oils.

14:02:31
Dee Dee
Thank you everyone!  Have a great day!

14:03:07
michael b
i hope the winter is not too grim around Madison.

14:05:38
Dee Dee
Me too!  Take care, Michael.

14:06:56
michael b
a  wonderful thanksgiving to you and your family      

14:07:17
michael b

Dee Dee
