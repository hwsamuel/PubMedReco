kristina
Hello all. It is great to see you all here tonight. 

19:59:40&nbsp;
Joseph
good to see you kris

19:59:42&nbsp;
kristina
Please go ahead with any questions, stories, comments, or concerns related to health, taking enemas, colon hydrotherapy, coffee enemas, enema equipment...

19:59:48&nbsp;
kristina
Thanks, Joseph. You too.

a most wonder summer greeting to all, watch for the perses meteor showers

The first piece of news that I want to share is about our new 4 Quart Stainless Steel Enema Can that we are having manufactured here in Wisconsin.

20:00:49&nbsp;
kristina
Welcome, Rita.

20:01:23&nbsp;

Hello Kristina

20:02:23&nbsp;
Kathy
Hello. I recently had a colon hydrotherapy session and mentioned that I've had pain on the left side of my belly button for years. During the session, I felt the pain. It was mentioned that I may have diverticulitis.

20:02:41&nbsp;
Kathy
If that is what I have, is it safe to have more colon hydrotherapy?

20:02:43&nbsp;
kristina
Another element of this unique 4 Quart Stainless Steel Enema Bucket is that it has a barbed hose drain welded to the bottom to allow all solution to drain out of the can. This is not true of any other stainless steel enema bucket currently on the market.

20:03:14&nbsp;
michael b
kristina, what a great photo of you and your daughter on face book.

20:04:33&nbsp;
kristina
Kathy, when a client  has been diagnosed with diverticulitis, we don't recommend colon hydrotherapy. You might proceed by having a colonoscopy.

20:04:39&nbsp;
Dave
Topics for tonight?

20:05:08&nbsp;
Kathy
Could the colon hydrotherapy make the condition worse?

20:05:17&nbsp;
kristina
Thanks, Michael. It is, isn't it? I took it with my I-Phone while we were on a solar-powered ferris wheel at the Santa Monica Pier in June.

20:05:56&nbsp;
kristina
I work with people who have decreased their DIVERTICULOSIS with the use of regular in-home enemas.

Kristina, I purchased the 4 quart enema set from you.  I take daily or every other day enemas.  I am in the middle of taking a 3-day series of colonics.  My CT utilizes the Woods Gravity Flow Method.  She said yesterday (day 1) 

20:08:31&nbsp;
Rita H.
that she could not detect peristalsis. I think she is concerned that too many enemas may be slowing down my peristalsis.

20:07:52&nbsp;
kristina
This Facebook page will also be another way that people can explore our products.

20:08:50&nbsp;
Joseph
Kris, I had my prostate out June 3rd.  I was wondering whether my bottom is healed enough for enemas now...

20:08:54&nbsp;
Kathy
Can improved diet (ex: eliminating dairy, grains, most meat, sugar) improve diverticulitis?

20:08:55&nbsp;
kristina
Wikipedia tells us, &quot;Diverticulosis, otherwise known as diverticular disease, is the condition of having diverticula in the colon, which are outpocketings of the colonic mucosa and submucosa through weaknesses of muscle layers in the colon wall. These are more common in the sigmoid colon, which is a common place for increased pressure. This is uncommon before the age of 40, and increases in incidence after that age&quot;

20:09:50&nbsp;
Dave
A late aunt needed a barium enema to diagnose her diverticulosis. She had a well-used enema bag at home but don't know if she used it for self-treatment along with her daughter.

20:09:51&nbsp;
kristina
With this definition in mind, we can see that reducing the pressure in the sigmoid colon is important in healing.

20:10:11&nbsp;
Kathy
How do we reduce the pressure?

20:10:35&nbsp;
kristina
You don't get stool build-up in the lower colon.

20:10:53&nbsp;
kristina
Move the bowels daily, up to a foot or more of stool

20:11:17&nbsp;
Kathy
Thank you very much, Kristina!

20:11:52&nbsp;
kristina
One needs to be careful with using colon cleansing if the muscular layer of the colon has gotten extremely weak. 

20:12:08&nbsp;
kristina
If this is the case, a colon tube can puncture through the colon. 

20:12:27&nbsp;
kristina
It is unlikely that a soft nozzle will puncture through the colon, however.

20:13:23&nbsp;
Kathy
Could a colonoscopy perhaps do the same?

20:13:48&nbsp;
kristina
With diverticulosis, I always recommend sticking with the Flexible Plastisol Enema Nozzles

20:14:30&nbsp;
kristina
Rita, did I miss the thread you are working on? I am just seeing now that you have written. Might you start over?

20:15:10&nbsp;
Rita H.
Kristina, I purchased the 4 quart enema set from you. I take daily or every other day enemas. I am in the middle of taking a 3 day series of colonics. My CT utilizes the Woods Gravity Flow Method.

20:15:21&nbsp;
Rita H.
She said yesterday (day 1) that she could not detect peristalsis...

20:15:37&nbsp;
Scott
Kathy, yes, it can happen and did to my mother-in-law.  But it is rare.  Having been a recent recipient of a colonoscopy, the prep and procedure are designed to minimize that possibilty.  But it still exists.

20:15:56&nbsp;
Rita H.
I think she is concerned that too many enemas may be slowing down my peristalsis.

20:15:58&nbsp;
kristina
Serious complications of a colonoscopy, such as colon perforation, occur in 0.5% of colonoscopies. 

20:16:23&nbsp;
kristina
According to The Annals Of Internal Medicine, the rate of serious complications from colonoscopy screening is 10 times higher than for any other commonly used cancer-screening test.

20:16:50&nbsp;
kristina
What do you think, Rita?

20:16:52&nbsp;
Dave
Most invasive cancer test too.

20:18:16&nbsp;
Kathy
If I have a slight buldging out of my skin to the left of my belly button, can that be a possibility it is diverticulitis?

20:18:45&nbsp;
Rita H.
I continue to have a bowel movement on the days I do not have an enema.  I am concerned about the peristalsis.  I thought that the enemas and or the    colonic would strengthen the peristalsis.

20:18:53&nbsp;
kristina
It is more likely a hernia...

20:19:03&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Hello everyone! Sorry I'm late. Life has been very busy for me!

20:19:08&nbsp;
kristina
It is not likely a diverticula.

20:19:11&nbsp;
RC
hello

20:19:16&nbsp;
kristina
Welcome, Lisa and RC.

20:19:18&nbsp;
Kathy
Thank you!

20:19:39&nbsp;
Joseph
Hiya Lisa, RC

20:19:52&nbsp;
Kathy
If that were the case, can colon hydrotherapy be harmful for a hernia?

20:20:18&nbsp;
Dave
Hi Lisa. BillsE says hi to you and all here but had a time conflict.

20:20:28&nbsp;
RC
Kristina, what does it mean if I see blood in bowel movement?

20:21:21&nbsp;
kristina
In the 10 years of being a colon hydrotherapist and working with the enema series, I have not seen regular colon cleansing reduce the strength of the colonic smooth muscles.

20:22:31&nbsp;
kristina
A contraindication is when a colonic irrigation/enema device should NOT be used, unless with a prescription or direct supervision of a physician.

20:23:01&nbsp;
Lou g
I have used a bulb for enemas most of my life. About two years ago I tried using large volume enemas. I never could hold more than about a quart and went back to the SVE. I thought that I would become accustomed to the LVE after a while. Why not?

20:23:09&nbsp;
kristina
An ABDOMINAL HERNIA is a contraindication for colon cleansing. Again, this is when a client/user has been diagnosed with abdominal hernia or has had surgery for abdominal hernia.

20:23:37&nbsp;
kristina
Lou, do you take the water into the colon slowly when you use the large volume enema?

20:24:33&nbsp;
kristina
There are many things that cause rectal bleeding. The two most common causes are anal fissures and hemorrhoids. Tiny tears, usually less than half an inch long on the skin of the anus, are anal fissures. 

20:24:54&nbsp;
Lou g
the only time I was able to take a quart, the bag was just barely above my hips while on my left side

20:25:23&nbsp;
Scott
Kristina, I had an abdominal hernia repair last October and was told by the doctor I could resume my normal functions in about six weeks.  He had no indication I would be using enemas after that time.  What is my continued risk, if any, in continuing with my weekly enema series?

20:25:59&nbsp;
Kathy
Can an abdominal hernia be diagnosed without an invasive colonoscopy?

20:26:28&nbsp;
Lisa P.
RC, I'm not a fan of doctors, but if I had blood in my bowel, I would play it safe and see a doctor.

20:26:32&nbsp;
Lou g
even with an 8oz bulb, I can only take one or two and then it is time to release

20:26:35&nbsp;
kristina
Lou, have you seen our movie short, Large Volume Enemas?

20:27:02&nbsp;
Lou g
Yes I have the video

20:27:42&nbsp;
Rita H.
Thank you.  Also, I am a Registered Nurse and wanting to train in colon hydrotherapy... I would like to train on the gravity flow method and the Dotolo type machine... Do you have any suggestions or know of anyone that trains in both?  Thanks again!

20:27:43&nbsp;
RC
ok thanks

20:27:55&nbsp;
kristina
Have you tried sea salt? That works wonders for many in your situation.

20:28:45&nbsp;
kristina
Swollen veins located in the lower rectum and anus are referred to as hemorrhoids. If these are irritated while passing stool, there can be blood on the stool.

20:29:01&nbsp;
kristina
rectal bleeding may be caused by diverticula in the colon

20:29:49&nbsp;
kristina
Colon cancer is not a common cause of rectal bleeding, however it is more common for colon cancer to cause blood to be in the bowel movements. In this case the blood may not be visible. There are special tests that may be performed to show that there is blood present in the stool. 

20:30:14&nbsp;
kristina
If you find that you have bleeding, make sure that you visit your health care provider. It is important to make sure that this is not a symptom of a serious illness.

20:31:02&nbsp;
kristina
Check with the International Association of Colon Hydrotherapists for certified schools: http://i-act.org

20:31:18&nbsp;
Dave
Yes, don't fool with blood in stool, especially if the stool is black, indicating bleeding higher than the lower rectal area.

20:31:23&nbsp;
kristina
I don't know anyone who trains in both. I have a Dotolo Toxygen in my office and I am extremely happy with it.

20:31:48&nbsp;
Rita H.
Can you do both gravity and pressure with it?

20:31:59&nbsp;
kristina
Only pressure.

20:32:22&nbsp;
kristina
I am not sure how a hernia is diagnosed.

20:32:41&nbsp;
Rita H.
I have had both. It just seems like the gravity gives a much better cleanse.  At least when I have the gravity method, I feel like I had a wonderful, thorough cleanse.

20:33:08&nbsp;
michael b
there was a hot tub and sauna display in reno. they used russian hemlock wood and constructed it in michigan. an FIR infared sauna. i bought one. the info you have included about such saunas encouraged me to do so. 

20:33:57&nbsp;
kristina
Here is more on the hernia: inguinal hernias occur when soft tissue - usually part of the intestine - protrudes through a weak point or tear in your lower abdominal wall. The resulting bulge can be painful - especially when you cough, bend over, or lift a heavy object.

20:34:13&nbsp;
kristina
many inguinal hernias now can be successfully repaired with a technique that uses several small incisions, leading to a faster, less painful recovery.

20:34:15&nbsp;
Dave
A colonic place I use offers both closed and open type, to meet client demand. I'm partial to closed myself.

20:34:21&nbsp;
Lou g
I can usually get a clear return after about two quarts injected 8 oz at a time. Is that as good as a LVE? I have never tried a retention nozzle and would not want to without some help.

20:34:37&nbsp;
kristina
A physical exam is usually all that's needed to diagnose an inguinal hernia. Your doctor is likely to ask about your signs and symptoms and to check for a bulge in the groin area. Because coughing can make a hernia more prominent, you may be asked to cough or strain as part of the exam.

20:35:25&nbsp;
kristina
Certainly, the enema bag is an excellent gravity system!

20:36:01&nbsp;
kristina
That is great, Michael. Have you been using it? How often? What results are you seeing?

20:36:19&nbsp;
Kathy
The pain where the slight buldge is (to the left of the belly button) comes and goes. More so after I eat, but recently at other times too.

20:36:36&nbsp;
kristina
Some people simply don't need to use a lot of water to clear out the colon. 

20:36:57&nbsp;
kristina
Lou, how do you feel after the treatment? How often do you take the colon cleanse?

20:38:32&nbsp;
Kathy
The pain seems to be more frequent after I had my last colon hydrotherapy session approx. one month ago.

20:39:37&nbsp;
Lou g
I have been taking monthly enemas for two years now. the first year I tried a bag and then went back to using an 8-oz bulb. Never felt better! I wasn't sick at all last winter.

20:40:29&nbsp;
kristina
Kathy, how long have you noticed this slight protrusion?

20:40:54&nbsp;
michael b
for myself, a hernia was a bulge that all but disappears when lying flat. the sauna is to be delivered on thursday. more news later.

20:40:55&nbsp;
Kathy
Probably at least a year.

20:41:16&nbsp;
kristina
Lou, it sounds as if the current treatment is completely adequate. However, if you are interested in trying to take in more enema solution, try the sea salt.

20:41:46&nbsp;
kristina
How do you feel about having it checked out by a medical doctor?

20:42:16&nbsp;
Kathy
I am comfortable with that.

20:42:35&nbsp;
Dave
With swine flu about to reappear in strength, any advice, Kris, on a preventive such as colon cleansing? Once, home enema care was common for flu patients. 

20:42:39&nbsp;
Kathy
I'm not comfortable with a colonoscopy, though.

20:43:20&nbsp;
michael b
kathy, there are a lot a real neat patches, kinda like a radial tire.

20:43:22&nbsp;
RC
thank you for the information.  Can you please tell me how long it should take for 1 quart of coffee in an enema to be put in the colon? Not how long to hold it, just how long should it take to be put in the colon to hold?

20:43:33&nbsp;
Lou g
I have tried sea salt. And I use your soap exclusively. it is the mildest I have used.

20:44:01&nbsp;
Kathy
Michael b, I guess those patches involve surgery?

20:44:43&nbsp;
kristina
to implant one quart of coffee into the colon takes 3-5 minutes, usually. this is after the colon has been emptied with an enema series.

20:44:55&nbsp;
Kathy
Can I assume there is no natural way to heal an abdominal hernia?

20:46:24&nbsp;
kristina
Now for a bit on the national health care debate:
          MYTH: Grassroots protesters are disrupting town halls. House Republican Leader John Boehner’s Office: &quot;Back home for the August recess, rank-and-file Democratic Members of the House are facing a backlash from their constituents.&quot;
          FACT: Lobbyist-run groups are orchestrating extremist mobs. Republicans and well-funded special interest groups are sending far-right extremists to local town halls to stop any meaningful discussion of health insurance reform. Some of these mob scenes have turned especially ugly -- including the hanging of Members of Congress in effigy and use of Nazi SS symbols.

20:46:41&nbsp;
kristina
MYTH: &quot;Government-Encouraged Euthanasia.&quot; House Republican Leader John Boehner claimed the House bill &quot;may start us down a treacherous path toward government-encouraged euthanasia.&quot;
          FACT: The bill never requires anyone to discuss end-of-life care. Rather, the bill ensures medical professionals who do offer this type of counseling … are reimbursed for their time, just as … for other types of counseling or medical services.

20:47:05&nbsp;
Scott
Kathy, my hernia surgery took 20 minutes.  Because of the local you're given, you need someone to drive you home.  But after two days of the pain killer, 8 hours apart, I was walking around normally. Six weeks later, all is normal.  This is the most common

20:47:18&nbsp;
Scott
surgery done in the US.

20:47:25&nbsp;
Lisa P.
My son had a hernia. This was caused by pushing someone's car. He waited a very long time to see a doctor, and he was in great pain. Finally he saw a doctor and had it taken care of. He's a young guy in good shape, and took him a number of months to recover

20:47:53&nbsp;
kristina
I don't think it is likely that you have a hernia, but I am interested in assisting you to figure this out. 

20:48:32&nbsp;
kristina
Even though I brought it up, men get hernias much more often than women do, and most of them are caused by heavy lifting. With these so-called inguinal hernias, a piece of intestine slides through the abdominal muscle into the groin or upper thigh area.

20:49:18&nbsp;
kristina
If it is a hernia, then you need to look at your protein consumption.A hernia can result from an abdominal muscle wall that is protein -deficient. 

20:49:30&nbsp;
Kathy
Lisa P, sounds like your son healed on his own. That's great!

20:49:36&nbsp;
michael b
very minimal sugery, .05% failures, you will have minor pain, but not like a bullfighter. 

20:49:48&nbsp;
kristina
A hair tissue mineral analysis will assist you with this.

20:50:16&nbsp;
kristina
by looking at your phosphorus levels, we can determine if you are eating enough protein for your individual biochemistry.

20:50:20&nbsp;
Lisa P.
No, he had the surgery.

20:51:59&nbsp;
Kathy
I have reduced my meat consumption recently due to diet change. I'm eating more veggies.

20:52:08&nbsp;
kristina
Here is one comment that might interest you: &quot;About 10 days ago I came across this site that said that you can relieve hernia pain and symptoms by massaging the reflex points on your feet. So I read up on it and started massaging my feet, which were pretty sore at the pressure points at the start. After a couple of days the pain started to recede, and believe it or not, the bulge in my groin got smaller and smaller too.&quot; 

20:52:08&nbsp;
Lisa P.
His hernia was very bad, and it was rough, but he is just fine now. It just took a while.

20:53:06&nbsp;
kristina
MYTH: Private plans outlawed. Rep. Doc Hastings (R-Wash.) claimed on his website that individual private health insurance plans will be outlawed in 2013 under the Democratic health care plan.
          FACT: Private health insurance not banned. Individual policies will continue to be available, but people will buy those policies through the national health insurance exchange, which will ensure that people with pre-existing conditions will be able to get coverage. The House bill also allows for existing policies to be grandfathered in, so individual purchasers who like their coverage will be able to keep it.

20:53:14&nbsp;
kristina
MYTH: 120 million Americans will be deprived of health care. Rep. Mike Pence (R-Ind.): Democrats’ plan &quot;will deprive roughly 120 million Americans of their current health care coverage.&quot;
          FACT: The 120 million number Pence cites comes from the Lewin Group, a wholly owned subsidiary of insurance giant UnitedHealthCare, which based its numbers on several public-option scenarios that are dramatically different than what Democrats have proposed. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that in 2013 about 11 million - NOT 120 million - Americans will end up voluntarily enrolling in the public option, and none of them will be &quot;deprived&quot; of coverage.

20:53:45&nbsp;
Kathy
Interesting you mention this because I have plantar fasciitis (approx. two years now) and I am going to get my first massage tomorrow. She is going to work on my feet and calves! Maybe this will help reduce the pain near my belly button, too.

MYTH: There is a Republican plan. Minority Whip Cantor: &quot;The Republican plan&quot; provides &quot;access to affordable basic coverage.&quot;
          FACT: &quot;Republicans have yet to coalesce around a single plan.&quot; Even though the House Republicans' &quot;Health Care Solutions Group&quot; guaranteed a counterproposal, they have refused to release a plan to the public.
