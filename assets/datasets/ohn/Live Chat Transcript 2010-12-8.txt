Hello!

20:02:53
Alan D
Hello all.

20:03:13
Clyde E.
Evening.

20:03:58
Clyde E.
What is the subject for the evening?

20:04:41
Kristina
Well, this isn't the topic, but I am just finishing listening to a YouTube video of Ray Bradbury talking about writing. Excellent!

20:05:39
Dave
Hi all.

20:05:45
Alan D
OK, any ideas on how a coffee enema would help a stage 4 liver?

20:05:49
Kristina
Have any of you had the chance to read our blog?

20:06:24
gewind48
I have enjoyed the first time I tried the enema with the essential oils and had the sensation you have after a mouth rinse, but I have a job with challenging hours to do this on a consistent basis.

20:06:42
Clyde E.
No, Kristina.

20:07:12
Clyde E.
G:  Which oils did you use?

20:07:17
Kristina
If you go to our home page, you will find a link to a talk I give about how coffee enemas work.

20:07:45
Kristina
Here is the link (MP3 file).

20:08:03
Alan D
OK, thanks.

20:08:28
gewind48
I used all of the oils mentioned in the part of obtaining the oils and used 4 drops in a two quart bag.

20:09:32
Kristina
Coffee enemas improve liver function.

20:10:09
Dave
DeeDee said in last chat that externally applying essential oils gave great and fast relief for bloating and stomach ache. Should this be followed by enema/colonic use of oils or need not?

20:11:01
howard
I also used 6 drops in 4 quarts and it worked just fine. I lay in a tub of hot water, which I find it easier to take the two plus one coffee.

20:11:10
Kristina
Coffee enemas improve the detoxification capacities of the liver by increasing the activity of a family of enzymes called glutathione S-transferase by as much as 700%.

20:11:24
Kristina
Coffee enemas increase bile flow.

20:11:36
Kristina
Coffee enemas improve kidney function.

20:11:46
deb s
Hi, Kristina, do you believe one might need to exercise caution in the number per week?

20:12:23
Alan D
Will it help to lower other enzymes levels?

20:13:16
gewind48
My one problem was holding the enema in my bowels for the 15 minute period without an inflatable nozzle and need to purchase one, but will have to wait until after Christmas.

20:13:59
Kristina
Glutathione S-transferase are essential for the immune system to exert its full potential.

20:14:01
Alan D
They do work great, especially the double ones.

20:14:10
deb s
Seems I'm flushing contents from small intestine and so concerned about absorbing nutrients.

20:15:12
Kristina
GST detoxifies xenobiotics (foreign compounds) and carcinogens, both organic and inorganic. 

20:15:52
Kristina
It is not possible to flush the contents of the small intestines using an enema.

20:16:08
Kristina
Can you say why you think this is happening, Deb?

20:18:15
Don G
Why don't more CT's offer enemas?

20:18:21
Kristina
How much colon cleansing you do week to week, month to month, year to year will vary, depending on your goals, your diet, your response to the colon cleansing, what solutions you use in the cleanse, and more.

20:19:19
Kristina
Other colon hydrotherapists haven't been encouraged around or education about the enema.

20:20:21
Don G
Does I-ACT discourage enemas?

20:20:31
gewind48
I would like to do more colon cleansing, but being on the road has its challenges. I feel much better after just the first time.

20:20:42
howard
I do the routine every other day.

20:21:19
Dave
Don't think many CT schools encourage enemas, frankly. Competition?

20:22:24
Kristina
The training that colon therapists undergo is specific to Class II and Class III devices, which are &quot;designed to allow evacuation of the contents of the colon during the administration of the colonic irrigation.&quot;

20:22:43
Kristina
I spoke at a regional meeting two months ago.

20:23:19
deb s
Here is the reason I thought small intestine contents were coming out.  I thought the coffee stimulated the gallbladder to squirt bile, and that goes into the SI.  But more than that, the feces are sometimes very small, sometimes with undigested seeds/fiber.

20:23:26
Kristina
Many colon hydrotherapists are in favor of recommending enemas to their clients.

20:23:41
Kristina
Excellent, gewind48!

20:24:03
Clyde E.
I travelled 22 weeks straight. The first thing when I arrived at a hotel on Sunday evening was to set up and do a colon cleanse so I would be ready for Monday morning.

20:24:40
deb s
Cool, travel enemas :)

20:24:51
Kristina
If you want to take an enema, but feel you don't have time in your day, fill a bulb syringe with filtered water and essential oils. 

20:25:14
Kristina
When the treatment needs to be quick, the bulb syringe and the oils can make a big difference.

20:25:17
Dave
I know some advise pee-session enema at home if impacted to make colonic  more effective.

20:25:45
Kristina
Oils. The Optimal Health Center has done a lot of research on what essential oils can be beneficial in the colon.

20:26:00
gewind48
If I could stay in a motel/hotel, I would carry my items with me, but I travel and sleep in an eighteen wheeler and it's not possible to carry the items I need.

20:26:10
Alan D
Any suggestions on oils or soaps to use in an enema for someone whose bowels do not work any more?

20:26:15
Kristina
Also, we have developed a self-testing method to determine which oils are best for you at any given moment.

20:26:42
Kristina
I see your point!

20:26:52
Clyde E.
An 18 wheeler would offer challenges for sure.

20:27:28
Clyde E.
Kris, is this test available on the web?

20:28:49
Kristina
We recommend that you start with frankincense, lemon, lavender, peppermint, as well as the blends Purification, PanAway, Peace &amp; Calming, Thieves and Valor.

20:29:10
Kristina
The test is free and written up on the website. You just need a collection of essential oils.

20:29:25
Alan D
Great, I have 3 of those.

20:30:03
Kristina
Has anyone here tried Essential Oil Body Feedback yet?

20:30:09
gewind48
I have five of the oils and will be interested in the test.

20:30:21
Alan D
No I have not.

20:30:28
howard
Signing off - Merry Chistmas and a Happy Hanukkah.

20:30:46
Kristina
Pre-colon hydrotherapy session enema at home before you visit the therapist.

20:30:51
Alan D
I assume I should take an enema every day for best results?

20:30:52
Kristina
Yes, they do.

20:31:08
Kristina
You remind me of the movie, 127 Hours. I recommend it.

20:31:18
Kristina
Bye Howard. Thanks for being here.

20:31:35
Kristina
Not, necessarily, Alan. 

20:31:41
Don G
Kris, in August 2006 in a chatroom you suggested a value in a prostate massage. In September you changed your mind. Why? 

20:32:00
Alan D
Oh OK.

20:32:20
Kristina
The Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis is the best tool to determine enema frequency for each person.

20:32:28
deb s
Oh.

20:32:53
Dave
Know it's been advised to me by CTs who otherwise don't give enemas.

20:33:28
Kristina
Some people benefit tremendously with daily enemas - people with cancer, constipation, fibromyalgia, etc., and those who are detoxifying.

20:34:28
Alan D
&lt; Has chronic constipation.

20:34:57
Kristina
It is best if the bowels empty fully each and every day.

20:35:41
deb s
This is my first chat.  Glad to be with people appreciating benefits.  So many people I know are, omg!

20:35:51
Alan D
Mine will go 8 to 10 days. Nothing is done to make them function.

20:35:52
Kristina
Learn how to test which essential oils to use on yourself

20:36:05
Kristina
Yikes!

20:36:07
gewind48
Wow, this would remove 10 pounds in a few minutes?

20:36:11
Kristina
This is no good.

20:36:36
Kristina
Alan, it is much healthier to take the daily enema to keep your bowels moving.

20:37:08
deb s
I have used glycerin suppository when constipated if no time for enema.  Now logging out in a few - will be back next time.

20:37:28
Alan D
I have been taking Miralax but it's too unpredictable for me.

20:38:13
deb s
For me, the glycerin suppository works quickly, then it's over.  Usually one does the trick; sometimes takes two suppositories together.

20:38:44
deb s
I don't know about 8-10 days.  Yikes.

20:39:10
Alan D
I ended up in the ER  after 10 days.

20:39:40
gewind48
I'll keep the glycerin suppository in mind if needed, but so far I am able to control with diet.

20:39:45
Kristina
When did this happen, Alan?

20:39:51
Kristina
How did you come to use enemas?

20:40:05
Alan D
About 6 months ago.

20:40:08
Kristina
How long had your constipation been going on?

20:40:26
Kristina
Welcome, Tomiowa.

20:40:41
Alan D
Constipation has been a problem for over 5 years.

20:40:45
tomiowa
Hello all. Finally got page up.

20:40:51
Kristina
Yeah!

20:41:10
tomiowa
It's snowing in Michigan tonight.

20:41:29
Alan D
They gave an enema with soap in the hospital, so if it works there, it should work at home.

20:41:43
Kristina
Glycerin suppositories are a fine tool, but they only clear out the lower colon so you don't want to rely on them solely, as the ascending and transverse colon need to be cleared also.

20:41:47
Kristina
Nice.

20:42:09
tomiowa
Did the hospital use a nozzle or colon tube?

20:42:12
Kristina
How do you feel overall now that you take regular enemas?

20:42:38
Alan D
My constipation and liver problems are from taking Oxycontin for many years.

20:42:56
Kristina
Why do you take Oxycontin?

20:43:24
Alan D
Must have been a tube - they forced it through the transverse colon.

20:43:36
Alan D
Chronic back pain.

20:44:13
Alan D
Plus nerve deadeners, anti-inflammatories.

20:45:13
Kristina
In addition to clearing the entire colon with the large volume enema, the enema solution used is ideally therapeutic to the body and not just irritating to the colon, like glycerin.

20:45:23
Kristina
Sorry.

20:45:49
Kristina
Has your back pain diminished with regular use of the colon cleanse?

20:46:50
tomiowa
The goat's milk soap has really worked well for me.

20:46:56
Alan D
No, but have not been taking enemas on a regular schedule.... I am ready to start doing that now.

20:47:23
Kristina
Any questions to get yourself set up?

20:47:35
Kristina
I have worked with many people who take daily enemas to great benefit.

20:47:57
Alan D
I have all I need - 4 qt silicone bag, soaps, peppermint, lavender, speculum, double bardex.

20:48:04
Kristina
Without knowing more about you, it is likely that the daily enema will improve your health.

20:48:12
Kristina
Excellent.

20:49:21
Alan D
Pain is from industrial accident - I backed into a running paint shaker.... left me with twisted muscles, nerve damage, and a herniated disc t8-t9.

20:49:43
Kristina
Back to the coffee enema. There is a lovely little documentary called The Gerson Miracle about Max Gerson.

20:49:48
tomiowa
I find the colon tube more effective than the nozzle system over several sessions.

20:49:58
Kristina
It details the history of the coffee enema.

20:50:13
Kristina
Ouch...

20:50:16
Alan D
I am hoping that a daily enema will take care of constipation and maybe let me shed a few pounds.

20:50:24
Kristina
I bet it will.

20:50:38
Kristina
How did you find the Optimal Health Network?

20:51:08
Alan D
Oh and I have a colon tube, one of your larger ones, 4 ft.

20:51:18
Kristina
Max Gerson led an interesting life.

20:51:23
Alan D
Web search for constipation.

20:51:30
Dave
Where is the Gerson documentary available?

20:51:44
Kristina
I watched the documentary on Netflix. [also see link above]

20:51:54
Clyde E.
Kris, the small inflatable colon tube has been great because it goes further up into the colon and is easier to retain when irrigating the colon.  Great investment.

20:52:17
Dave
Thanks.

20:52:48
Kristina
It shares the stories of nine long-time cancer survivors who have used the principles of the Gerson Therapy. 

20:53:12
gewind48
Bye, I have to exit. Will look for your next chat.

20:53:22
Kristina
Dr. Gerson developed his therapy in 1928.

20:54:17
Kristina
Gerson's daughter, Charolette, founder of the Gerson Institute, also shares her fight to keep the controversial therapy.

20:54:35
Alan D
Oh, when I use the speculum I put it in on my side. When I roll onto my back it falls out. Any ideas?

20:54:39
Kristina
Thanks fo that feedback, Clyde.

20:55:02
Dave
Done anywhere in US? Heard it was in Mexico.

20:55:14
Kristina
What speculum are you referring to?

20:56:10
Alan D
I have a hard plastic one with the center insert.

20:56:26
Kristina
Next live chat with DeeDee is on Wednesday, December 22nd at 12 noon CT.

20:57:03
Alan D
I am trying to make a set-up of colon irrigation at home.

20:57:07
Kristina
I would use a larger nozzle - Extra Large Green Nozzle is a great choice.

20:57:32
Kristina
The flexible inflatable nozzle is also a good choice.

20:57:39
Kristina
Yes, in Mexico.

20:57:46
Alan D
The one I have is large but no shoulder to help it stay in.

20:58:03
Kristina
Needs a shoulder.

20:58:15
Alan D
OK thanks.

20:58:21
Dave
Pinkish flex nozzle from OHC works well for me too.

20:59:10
Alan D
The one I have would be close to what they use in colon therapy.

20:59:18
tomiowa
The flex nozzle with inflatable bladder pink is good for a basic nozzle.

20:59:52
Kristina
Thanks so much for visiting with me tonight. I need to run now. Take care!

20:59:59
tomiowa
Bye.

21:00:05
Alan D
Bye. Thanks, Kristina

21:00:11
Dave
Be well, all.
