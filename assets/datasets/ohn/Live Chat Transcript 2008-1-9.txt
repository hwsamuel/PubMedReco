Hi early birds!

19:54:40&nbsp;
billythekid
Hi, Kristina and Carol45 

19:56:30&nbsp;
billythekid
I have a quick question: What is the safest LOW temperature for a coffee enema? I have trouble holding the enema if the temperature is in the 100 degree range. 

19:57:02&nbsp;
Dave
Hi all, Dave here

19:57:46&nbsp;
Kristina
Hello all

19:57:50&nbsp;
Lisa
Hi Everyone! It looks like our usual crew is here!

19:58:09&nbsp;
Carol45
Good to see you.

19:58:24&nbsp;
Lisa
How was your Xmas vacation?

19:58:36&nbsp;
Kristina
Low temperature enemas have been used for people who have a fever, to lower it.

19:58:43&nbsp;
TomIA
Hello, my first visit

19:59:17&nbsp;
Carol45
Seeing family at Christmas always goes by too fast. 

19:59:33&nbsp;
Kristina
As far as how low, I don't know an exact temperature but I imagine that you can go as low as 70 degrees

19:59:35&nbsp;
Lisa
Kris, did you get enough sun on your vacation?

19:59:47&nbsp;
Kristina
I didn't go because I had too much work to do. I will go in the summer

19:59:50&nbsp;
Dave
I think cool water enemas for high fever were standard, at least in 'my day.'

20:00:01&nbsp;
Kristina
Hi Tom! Welcome.

20:00:04&nbsp;
billythekid
Thank You, Kristina.

20:00:10&nbsp;
Carol45
Would the temperature change the effects of the coffee?

20:00:22&nbsp;
Kristina
Not that I know of but, truly, I don't know.

20:00:36&nbsp;
TomIA
Wondering if it would be best to make a personal visit for a hydrotherapy before investing into the silicone system with colon tube?

20:00:51&nbsp;
Kristina
Tom, it depends on what you are looking for.

20:01:10&nbsp;
Carol45
Interesting - a rerun of MASH had a warm water enema prescribed for a patient with hypothermia.

20:01:37&nbsp;
Dave
I think that's standard too.

20:01:51&nbsp;
Kristina
Taking enemas to fully cleanse your entire colon is easy, once you know what you are doing. We have very detailed instructions in the Silicone Flowmaster that will guide you through the process.

20:02:04&nbsp;
TomIA
Looking to see if I could improve overall health by improving habits and cleansing?

20:02:10&nbsp;
Kristina
We also have a wealth of information on both www.optimalhealthnetwork.com and on www.enemabag.com.

20:02:43&nbsp;
Kristina
However, if you need assistance with any type of ill health situation, you might want the wisdom and experience of  a colon hydrotherapist.

20:02:55&nbsp;
ealincoln
What do you think about castor oil packs?

20:02:57&nbsp;
Hogman
I'm not sure how to keep the nozzle in Kris...do you still charge $90? 

20:02:58&nbsp;
Kristina
Just make sure that the colon therapist that you plan to visit is knowledgeable.

20:03:06&nbsp;
TomIA
I have bought the downloads on large enema and the hydro procedure

20:03:51&nbsp;
Kristina
Tom, then getting your own system and viewing the DVD, Cleansing, Coffee Enemas and Colon Tubes ought to be an excellent starting place.

20:04:13&nbsp;
Hogman
I've tried 3 times to do it myself, and the nozzle keeps coming out

20:04:25&nbsp;
Kristina
I think castor oil packs are an excellent healing tool. What do you think about them? Why are you thinking of using them?

20:04:32&nbsp;
TomIA
Your location is a few hours but as close as any I have found plus I travel to WI often and could combine the travel

20:04:48&nbsp;
ealincoln
Just reading about them in Fourfold Path to Healing and am still not regular

20:04:58&nbsp;
Kristina
Yes, for an enema series, we do charge $90. You could try a phone consult, which is cheaper at $1.40 per minute. 

20:05:06&nbsp;
TomIA
Does the new 70D colon tube have the delrin tip?

20:05:09&nbsp;
Kristina
You might also invest in an enema retention nozzle.

20:05:28&nbsp;
Kristina
We would love to work with you, Tom.

20:05:56&nbsp;
Lisa
Tom, it's worth the trip! I went to OHC all the way from Texas!!

20:06:12&nbsp;
TomIA
I just recieved my order with the retention nozzle and peppermint oil

20:06:13&nbsp;
Kristina
Most people aren't going to fully improve, if improve at all, their regularity with the use of castor oil packs.

20:06:28&nbsp;
Kristina
What is the 70D colon tube that you refer to?

20:06:40&nbsp;
Kristina
Great

20:06:58&nbsp;
TomIA
The new 70 durometer colon tube on the website? Should do the colon hydro versus the enema route if I visit?

20:07:19&nbsp;
Kristina
Ealincoln, can you tell me more about your situation? 

20:07:37&nbsp;
Lisa
Tom, I did both when I was there.

20:07:58&nbsp;
ealincoln
It's Elizabeth.  I'm taking the Ashwaganda & Licorice for adrenal fatigue and hypothyroid.

20:08:09&nbsp;
TomIA
Both on the same visit?

20:08:11&nbsp;
ealincoln
Under your supervision

20:08:12&nbsp;
Kristina
Tom, it depends whether or not you wish to learn more about taking enemas or just have a good colon cleanse. Both will cleanse the colon. The enema series will teach you more about how to take enemas at home. The colon hydrotherapy session will not.

20:08:45&nbsp;
Hogman
also Fris... do you know of a place to get a prostate massage. You mention it is good for the prostate

20:10:15&nbsp;
Lisa
How nice we have a lot of people here today!

20:10:23&nbsp;
Carol45
I have a question about adding salt to the enema solution.  I had a very bad exerience getting dizzy and sick when taking a soapwater enema years ago.  Is it possible for that to happen when the correct amount of salt is used?

20:10:37&nbsp;
Kristina
no, item 668 does not have a delrin cap.

20:10:55&nbsp;
Mike
Kris - In a three series does soap / coffee & salt make sense?

20:10:56&nbsp;
Kristina
Only items with a 669 have a delrin cap

20:11:37&nbsp;
Dave
Since hydrotherapists are scarce in many places, the enema series probably is the most beneficial.

20:11:59&nbsp;
Kristina
Hi Elizabeth. How are you doing? How much fiber are you eating? 

20:12:18&nbsp;
Kristina
No, I do not know of a place to get a prostate massage.

20:12:45&nbsp;
ealincoln
Probably not enough. I'm trying to increase the amount I'm eating but the majority of my calories have been coming from raw milk products and bone broth soups w/ egg.

20:13:31&nbsp;
michael b
a wonderful winter to all, kristina, i read the tornado last tue.was the only 2ond.on record,since 1967, wow.

20:14:03&nbsp;
Kristina
Carol, salt in an enema won't ameloriate a negative reaction to soap. What might ameloriate a negative reaction to soap in an enema is using only therapeutic enema soaps. 

20:14:34&nbsp;
TomIA
You mention the grapefruit extract for dogs water, will that help with breath odor or what, I just bought some from your site for bag cleaning wondered what it might do for animal

20:14:49&nbsp;
Kristina
Can you add a handful of carrots in your daily diet, or some other fiber rich food?

20:15:05&nbsp;
Carol45
Kris. It hasn't happened using your goat milk soap, but i am very careful to add the salt, except for the coffee implant. 

20:15:26&nbsp;
ealincoln
Have been trying to eat more vegetables generally and will try to increase

20:15:47&nbsp;
Kristina
Weird, eh, on the weather, plus a 100 car crash about 5 miles from my house.

20:16:44&nbsp;
Dave
how's the new Web site coming along?

20:17:35&nbsp;
michael b
speaking of cars, did you get yours back?

20:18:21&nbsp;
Carol45
I take it then it was the (Ivory) soap that caused the problem, and with plain water it shouldn't happen?  I would like to take a series in the mornings now that I'm retired.  But am afraid of a reaction on a day when I have a late morning appointment. 

20:19:24&nbsp;
Kristina
Grapefruit Seed Extract kills worms, viruses, fungus and more and helps keep animals healthier.

20:19:51&nbsp;
Hogman
Kristina, which is better for a colon cleanse series......knees to chest with butt in air.....or on back with tube between legs?  Which procedure do you use?

20:19:52&nbsp;
ealincoln
How much Grapefruit Seed Extract should be added to how much water?

20:19:52&nbsp;
billythekid
Carol45, if there is too much of anything in your stomach at the time of the enema you will experience the symptoms you described regardless of what kind of enema it is. That has been my experience in the past. 

20:20:26&nbsp;
Kristina
Carol, I don't think the salt mediates any negative effect on the colon from the enema soap but rather years ago you used a soap that had an ingredient that your colon reacted to negatively.

20:21:05&nbsp;
Kristina
Elizabeth: Great! Remind me, are you taking any magnesium?

20:21:10&nbsp;
Carol45
Negative is right.  i thought i was going to pass out. 

20:21:26&nbsp;
Kristina
Whatever procedure one prefers.

20:21:26&nbsp;
TomIA
Theres a note online about how many drops for pet water

20:21:36&nbsp;
Dave
Ivory was the traditional ingredient of choice years ago, but i use castile or the goat milk soap, much milder. 

20:21:37&nbsp;
ealincoln
Yes, & calcium (both from Standard Processes) & zinc

20:21:43&nbsp;
Kristina
Elizabeth, what for what use?

20:21:59&nbsp;
Kristina
How many capsules of magnesium?

20:22:13&nbsp;
ealincoln
3 per day with the calcium with meals

20:22:57&nbsp;
Kristina
let's increase the magnesium to 2 capsules, three times per day, okay? Also, how many calcium?

20:23:02&nbsp;
Hogman
Thank you kris

20:23:02&nbsp;
TomIA
If I did the visit with you for the emema would we use the colon tube? I would purchase the system there if was locally available

20:23:13&nbsp;
ealincoln
2 tablets 3x/day

20:23:15&nbsp;
Kristina
We use the enema system that you provide.

20:23:25&nbsp;
Kristina
Great on the calcium

20:23:30&nbsp;
ealincoln
OK

20:23:46&nbsp;
ealincoln
increasing the magnesium should help with regularity?

20:23:50&nbsp;
TomIA
Would I need to mail order and bring it with me or could I pick it up at the visit

20:24:56&nbsp;
Carol45
ealincoln, I have found that the magnesium has greatly helped me with regularity.

20:24:59&nbsp;
Lisa
Tom, I picked up mine in my visit. Much easier.

20:25:06&nbsp;
ealincoln
Thanks, Carol

20:25:25&nbsp;
Kristina
Yes, increasing the magnesium will help with regularity. The body has what is called a "bowel tolerance" for magnesium. Once you are taking too much magnesium, you will get diarrhea 

20:25:35&nbsp;
ealincoln
I'm trying to educate myself on what vitamins and minerals do what

20:25:38&nbsp;
ealincoln
OK.

20:25:46&nbsp;
Lisa
And Tom, that way you don't have to pay postage!

20:25:46&nbsp;
Kristina
Good for you!

20:26:00&nbsp;
TomIA
Would we do a small and large emema per your download video on the same visit?

20:26:02&nbsp;
Carol45
Kristina has been a great help to me with the supplements. 

20:26:11&nbsp;
ealincoln
Indeed

20:26:38&nbsp;
Kristina
Yes, you get a total of 3 enemas during a 90-minute enema series here at the Optimal Health Center.

20:26:49&nbsp;
TomIA
I was not sure if the stock was onsite at the clinic

20:27:08&nbsp;
Kristina
Thanks, Carol. How are you feeling these days with your new supplement protocol?

20:27:31&nbsp;
Lisa
Yes, it's on site. Very handy.

20:27:31&nbsp;
Kristina
Yes, our shipping department is right here at our Center

20:27:44&nbsp;
TomIA
I will call and discuss the lead time for an appointment sounds like the way to start this off right

20:28:32&nbsp;
Lisa
Tom, you can have a massage and sauna too! It's so relaxing!!

20:28:50&nbsp;
Carol45
Better than I was, but for a while I was sure dragging.  Guess I'm still not getting the right kind of rest.  That old habit of pushing myself to finish something is a hard one to break. 

20:29:06&nbsp;
Kristina
Yes, Tom, and when you call to make your appointment, if you know what enema equipment you will want, order it at that point so that we may set it aside for you as we do occassionally run into back order situations.

20:29:07&nbsp;
ealincoln
I hear you, Carol

20:29:17&nbsp;
Dave
You will be happy, Tom, from the voices of experience.  

20:30:03&nbsp;
TomIA
I will look into the sauna and massage options as well

20:30:06&nbsp;
Carol45
A nice relaxing massage sounds so inviting!

20:30:11&nbsp;
Kristina
I, too, hear you, Carol. The demands of life are often stronger than the wisdom regarding how much sleep and what type of sleep one knows they need.

20:30:31&nbsp;
TomIA
Never done that, have given many to my wife but never treated myself

20:31:10&nbsp;
Kristina
Yes, we do have a fabulous situation here with the center offering a FIR sauna, a massage followed by a colon cleanse. It is a unique therapeutic experience.

20:31:31&nbsp;
TomIA
2-3 hours in the clinic?

20:31:45&nbsp;
Carol45
What type of a 'sauna' should I look for in my area?  There are a lot of beauty shops with tanning beds. 

20:32:07&nbsp;
Bob R
Lisa, where in the Austin area do you live, also, do you know of any colon theripists in the Georgetown area?

20:32:31&nbsp;
Kristina
3 hours, with a one hour massage. You can take a longer massage, if you wish.

20:32:43&nbsp;
Kristina
Look for a Far Infra Red Sauna. 

20:33:02&nbsp;
Dave
You mean many massages or enemas to your wife, Tom?

20:33:16&nbsp;
TomIA
Massages for the wife

20:33:49&nbsp;
TomIA
90minutes for enema session plus 90 more for sauna and massage?

20:34:19&nbsp;
Kristina
Yes.

20:34:33&nbsp;
Lisa
Bob, I don't go to a colon theripist anymore in Texas since we need an RX from a doctor to have one! Texas is the only state to do that!

20:35:43&nbsp;
Carol45
Lisa, I'll bet the ones over the state line are busy!

20:35:58&nbsp;
Lisa
In Georgetown, look up on the I-act website to safely find one.

20:36:21&nbsp;
Lisa
Sure you're right Carol!!

20:36:47&nbsp;
Hogman
Kristina....how long should an enema series take ?

20:37:24&nbsp;
Carol45
Hogman, as long as you like - don't rush them.

20:37:25&nbsp;
Kristina
Most enema series will take a minimum of 30 minutes, but we will take 60-90 minutes with people. 

20:37:37&nbsp;
Bob R
Thanks Lisa. I have, not recently, but nothing on the north side of Austin.

20:38:18&nbsp;
Lisa
You're right Bob, they all seem to be south!

20:38:25&nbsp;
michael b
question, per your book, page 145, combining flax tea with coffee, are both equally  absorbed? seems like to me the best of all.

20:39:09&nbsp;
Kristina
The time a series of enemas takes depends on how quickly you take the water into the colon, how much water you take in each enema in the series and how long it takes you to empty the colon in between enemas. Some people need to take a long time on the toilet, emptying the contents of their colon.

20:39:40&nbsp;
ealincoln
Kristina, do you recommend taking enemas for my situation?  If so, how many?

20:39:48&nbsp;
Dave
My series at OHN hav taken an hour or so, but it depends on fill and hold time, including the coffee implant.

20:40:19&nbsp;
Kristina
Hi Michael.

20:40:27&nbsp;
Lisa
Bob, Charlotte Lyne is the very best in Austin, but she is south. Worth the extra drive!

20:40:43&nbsp;
Kristina
I can't say how equally absorbed the flax seed tea is. Sorry, but I do know it is soothing.

20:43:11&nbsp;
TomIA
Is the colon tube more effective for cleaning deep than the retention nozzle for at home use

20:44:05&nbsp;
Lisa
Bob, maybe it's Layne. Can't think of the spelling now, but it's something like that. She's on Barton Springs Road.

20:44:33&nbsp;
Kristina
Yes, the colon tube is excellent to use in the second and/or third enema in the series as the lower colon will be cleared out so that you can insert the colon tube deeper into the colon for a more effective colon cleanse.

20:44:41&nbsp;
Hogman
I keep getting knocked off here..............sorry

20:44:53&nbsp;
Carol45
I think the tube versus retention nozzle is a personal choice.  I use the tube with good results, but have never tried the nozzle. 

20:45:01&nbsp;
Kristina
It is useful to have a retention nozzle on hand to use in the first and possibly second enema in the series.

20:45:10&nbsp;
Kristina
That is fine, Hogman.

20:46:03&nbsp;
Dave
The retention nozzle is easier to use solo than the colon tube, in my opinion.

20:46:41&nbsp;
TomIA
Is plain filtered or RO good for deep cleaning 

20:46:52&nbsp;
TomIA
will check out the message board

20:46:55&nbsp;
Dave
We could use all the posters we can.

20:46:57&nbsp;
Carol45
Yes, we'd like to see all of you on the board.

20:47:07&nbsp;
misulda
Kristina, will you record more DVDs? That one you made is very interesting and very educational.

20:47:22&nbsp;
Kristina
We are just in the process of launching our new site so I could use the extra minutes to do some more work. If anyone has any more questions or concerns, let me know now, otherwise, I will close down the chat until next month. I sure do enjoy this time each month.

20:47:33&nbsp;
Kristina
I will likely make more movies.

20:47:46&nbsp;
Kristina
RO water is excellent. 

20:47:50&nbsp;
ealincoln
Just wondered if I should be doing regular enemas along with everything else

20:47:59&nbsp;
Mike K
Kris does a coffee enema lose its effectiveness if held for longer than 12 or 15 minutes?

20:48:03&nbsp;
Kristina
Go to www.enemabag.com for a further discussion on water use in the enema.

20:48:03&nbsp;
Dave
Any ETA for the site. And next chat date?

20:48:10&nbsp;
TomIA
Thanks for the info and will be in contact by phone

20:48:30&nbsp;
Kristina
Elizabeth, if you aren't moving your bowels daily then taking enemas can be an excellent choice.

20:48:50&nbsp;
ealincoln
How often?

20:48:53&nbsp;
Lisa
Hope to see ALL of you on the message board!!

20:49:14&nbsp;
Dave
Best at Kris's Tom. 

20:49:17&nbsp;
Kristina
I think it is fine to hold a coffee enema longer than 12-15 minutes. I don't know if anyone knows exactly what happens in the body minute to minute. It would be good to know, but...

20:49:24&nbsp;
Carol45
ealincoln, do you have Kristinas book?

20:49:28&nbsp;
ealincoln
yes

20:49:32&nbsp;
ealincoln
that's how I got started with her

20:49:37&nbsp;
ealincoln
I'm in Pennsylvania

20:49:47&nbsp;
Kristina
One to seven times a week.

20:49:57&nbsp;
ealincoln
Got it.  Thanks!

20:50:01&nbsp;
Carol45
It has good recommendation on how often.

20:50:10&nbsp;
ealincoln
Thanks, Carol

20:50:12&nbsp;
Carol45
Please join us on the board.

20:50:32&nbsp;
Kristina
Talk to you all soon. Please do email or call if you need anything else. Bye.

20:50:38&nbsp;
ealincoln
It's a time consuming process and with everything else going on.... three kids, etc. it's sometimes hard to find the time to take care of yourself

20:50:42&nbsp;
Carol45
Kristina can we have a serun testing spot on the board?

20:50:59&nbsp;
Carol45
Supplements, etc.

20:51:08&nbsp;
Lisa
Kristina's book is great! One of a kind. You all should have it. Very helpful!

20:51:35&nbsp;
Kristina
See you on February 13th at 7.
