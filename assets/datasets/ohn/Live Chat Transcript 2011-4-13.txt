Hi.

20:00:20
randyu
Is there a better treatment for IBS other than high-fiber diet, meds, fiber tabs?

20:00:49
kristina
Hi Randy. Hi Dave.

20:00:52
randyu
Meds like scripts for donnatal tabs, with side effects.

20:01:17
kristina
Is there a better treatment for IBS than a high-fiber diet, medication, and fiber tablets? Absolutely!

20:01:26
randyu
What?

20:01:27
kristina
Do you have IBS?

20:01:30
randyu
Yes.

20:01:58
randyu
Don't know the cause - have some diverticula too.

20:02:06
kristina
How does it present, as there are many symptoms of a digestive system out of balance that medical diagnosis lumps into this catch-all category they call IBS.

20:02:20
ElleA
Are antibiotics the best protocol for h. pylori and parasites?

20:02:53
kristina
No, antibiotics are not the best protocol for most people with h. pylori and parasites.

20:03:01
kristina
What type of parasites are we talking about?

20:03:21
randyu
Certain foods will trigger it, just randomly, but get upset digestive system, active and then passive.

20:03:57
Brett H
Hi all!

20:04:01
ElleA
Pinworms and blastocystis hominis.

20:04:02
kristina
Do you have pain only? diarhhea? constipation? 

20:04:19
kristina
Are you talking about yourself, ElleA?

20:04:22
randyu
Kristina, I get all three, at times.

20:04:31
kristina
How often?

20:04:40
ElleA
Yes.

20:05:00
randyu
Comes and goes, sometimes good for many days, then flares up again and repeats.

20:05:31
kristina
How were you tested for the pinworms, blastocystis hominis and h. pylori? How do you know that is what you are dealing with? And, how do these things affect your health?

20:05:42
Larry H
My first time on the chat and looking for info on detox from lead fumes.

20:05:49
ElleA
GI test . 

20:06:28
ElleA
Bloating, constipation, rosacea, indigestion.

20:06:29
kristina
The most common causes of IBS are eating foods that no longer agree with your body - gluten, dairy, or sugar, for instance.

20:06:50
kristina
GI test from an alternative health practitioner or a medical doctor?

20:06:54
randyu
Yes, I eat a lot of processed foods.

20:07:01
ElleA
ND

20:07:03
kristina
How often do you have your symptoms, ElleA?

20:07:14
ElleA
Most of the time.

20:07:25
randyu
Diet means a lot in IBS - what we eat/drink.

20:07:55
kristina
I have a ten-day diet on my website that you can try. You would be amazed how much you might learn about your body by following the gluten-, dairy- and sugar-free diet for the ten days.

20:08:02
mike j
How about organic yogurt in one's diet?

20:08:03
kristina
Do you take enemas?

20:08:23
kristina
Some people do fine with yogurt; other people don't.

20:09:26
mike j
Can organic yogurt be used as an implant?

20:09:27
kristina
Elle, it is very likely that taking antibiotics to resolve your health issue will cause a great deal more trouble down the road, even if a course of antibiotics seems to help.

20:09:44
kristina
How long have you had these symptoms?

20:10:01
kristina
For some, organic yogurt can be used as an implant.

20:10:06
randyu
Enemas, only if extremely constipated.

20:10:11
ElleA
Years. Are these issues contagious?

20:11:15
kristina
My book, Ten Days to Optimal Health, goes into greater detail on the 10-day diet.

20:12:15
kristina
Some people report to me that just taking regular enemas relieves them of their IBS. I always say it is worth a try. However, I do find clinically that most people need to at least tweak their diets.

20:12:32
kristina
Pinworms, yes.

20:12:40
kristina
h. pylori, I think not.

20:13:15
kristina
Blastocysts hominis, I think not, but I am not 100% certain.

20:13:40
ElleA
Is the rosacea from these issues?

20:14:02
kristina
Randy, would you be able to eat only vegetables, fruits, meats, and gluten-free grains for 10 days?

20:14:03
randyu
Regular enemas, like how often?

20:14:37
Brett H
Which grains are gluten-free?

20:14:39
randyu
No, I don't think I could do without meat for that long.

20:14:40
mike j
Can using sugar substitutes harm one's colon health?

20:14:43
Dave
Are pinworms still common. I think medicated enemas were involved years back.

20:15:02
kristina
The need for enemas varies greatly from person to person. You could try once a day and see how you feel. Once a week would be the least to determine if they helped the IBS.

20:15:17
kristina
Pinworms are not uncommon.

20:15:59
kristina
All the varieties of rice, millet, quinoa, amaranth.

20:16:41
Brett H
Isn't rice a starch? That's what I've been decreasing in my diet - starch.

20:17:11
kristina
I do believe that those sugar substitutes can wreak havoc on one's health. I am not sure how they specifically affect the colon. Do you have a hunch or concern about this?

20:17:23
kristina
No, meat is fine for the entire ten days.

20:17:28
randyu
What is gluten-free?  

20:17:29
kristina
That is part of the beauty of the diet.

20:18:04
kristina
Gluten is the product component of many grains - wheat, rye, barley, some oats.

20:19:00
kristina
Elle, for you too I recommend beginning a gluten-, dairy- and sugar-free diet, in order to heal from your assorted ills.

20:19:18
Larry H
Will the coffee enema be an effective detox for lead and how often?

20:19:42
ElleA
Already gluten- and dairy-free and the only sugar I eat is really fruit or a little dark chocolate.

20:20:59
kristina
Yes, rice has starch in it. Starch is a carbohydrate produced by all green plants. It is the most common carbohydrate in the human diet. In and of itself, it is never bad for you. 

20:21:14
kristina
However, in excess, it can be hard on your health.

20:21:36
kristina
And, too much carbohydrate can cause unwanted weight gain.

20:22:09
kristina
Hi Larry. Thanks for the email earlier. I am glad that you are here.

20:22:33
kristina
The coffee enemas will be useful as part of an overall detox for lead. 

20:23:11
kristina
How often you would want to take the coffee enemas is best determined by a hair tissue mineral analysis, which you can learn about on our website.

20:23:47
kristina
I would start with a minimum of 2-3 per week, as long as they bring a sense of increased health after you take them.

20:23:52
howard
I have been told that peppermint oil is not working with Coumadin. Will lemon oil work for a replacement of peppermint oil?

20:24:01
kristina
What else are you doing to detoxify from the lead exposure?

20:24:22
kristina
Are you willing to share with the folks here how were exposed to lead? 

20:24:27
kristina
How much lead?

20:24:29
Larry H
I cut out coffee... which is hard!

20:24:39
kristina
What the exposure has seemingly done to your health?

20:24:53
kristina
Yes, cutting out coffee can be hard. I just wrote a new blog post about that today. [read post] 

20:25:18
Larry H
Yes... I poured a bunch of lead sinkers in my garage for two days.  Shortly after, I had no energy and lots of aches and pains.

20:25:19
kristina
Also, my prior blog post is about gluten sensitivity, which is a must read. [read post] 

20:25:30
kristina
What is a lead sinker?

20:25:49
Larry H
For fishing!

20:26:04
kristina
Oh, I get it. Now I know.

20:26:28
kristina
Sorry that happened. I think we need to find a less toxic material for those fishing sinkers.

20:27:16
kristina
If you are suffering from lead poisoning, the more we can do quickly, the better.

20:27:29
Larry H
Sounds more like the EPA all the time.  There just aren't many alternatives for the home hobby market.

20:27:53
kristina
I understand the challenge. 

20:28:05
kristina
I recommend you call and talk to DeeDee tomorrow. 

20:28:39
Larry H
I'll check on the hair analysis but can't make it to Madison until my appointment in May.

20:28:49
kristina
You would benefit from starting on one of our cleansing programs from either Standard Process or Ortho Molecular.

20:28:54
kristina
Call her.

20:29:06
Larry H
Will do...thanks!

20:29:21
kristina
The longer the lead is in the body, the more damage it will do. Makes sense, right?

20:29:23
randyu
Thanks, logging off, good night.

20:29:31
kristina
Thank you, Randy.

20:30:43
Larry H
Since I'm new to all of this, which side do you lay on for the enema?

20:31:02
kristina
I am not sure if lemon oil is your best option. That is an excellent question for DeeDee as she is the essential oils expert. Please call or e-mail her tomorrow.

20:31:49
kristina
Great question, Larry. Believe it or not, there is some controversy about how to lay your body during an enema.

20:32:39
Dave
I think the left side is the most common position for enemas. On the bed or bathroom floor.

20:32:39
kristina
I have found over the years that taking an enema on the back is the easiest and as effective as any other position.

20:33:04
kristina
How do the other people on the chat lay when taking an enema?

20:33:22
Larry H
That's how I started but the LVE video shows the right side.

20:33:45
kristina
I go into detail in my downloadable videos, Small Volume Enema and Large Volume Enema, about which positions work best during an enema.

20:33:50
Dave
On the back works with gravity for more enema solution.

20:33:51
Brett H
I usually lay on my back.

20:33:53
Don G
Knee-chest is the only way I can feel the solution.

20:34:21
kristina
See, it really varies, depending on what works for the individual.

20:34:33
Brett H
I want to try the knee-chest position, but I can't get my bag high enough.

20:34:42
kristina
I suggest trying all the positions to see what works best for you.

20:34:57
Larry H
My order should arrive tomorrow and I can start trying a few different things to see what works best.

20:36:05
Dave
Don, can  you do knee-chest by yourself? I find it a challenge to do myself.

20:36:28
kristina
The feature of the April newsletter will be about enema implants using essential oils and coconut oil that have been mixed together, poured into small, rounded ice cube trays, and frozen.

20:36:51
Don G
I always look for help but no CT's in the area offer it.

20:36:52
kristina
DeeDee came up with this idea.

20:37:01
Larry H
I'm seeing several different options for implants after a 3-enema series.  How effective is the 2-oz olive oil w/ essential oil? Is that enough volume?  Also interested in the suppositories made w/ coconut oil.

20:37:46
kristina
I think it is brilliant and offers a unique and easy-to-use delivery system of customized enema implants.

20:38:19
kristina
I guess they are more accurately called suppositories, aren't they?

20:39:31
kristina
Essential oil implants and suppositories are more effective than using the same oils/herbs orally.

20:40:04
kristina
Yes, 2 ounces is enough volume but more olive oil can be added to reach deeper into the colon.

20:40:39
Dave
Because they get to work better if taken rectally?

20:41:06
Larry H
Then, the better &quot;delivery system&quot; would be your implant syringe and short colon tube?

20:41:15
mike j
I have found that the use of olive oil greatly enhances...

20:42:47
Don G
Kristina..why don't I-ACT certified colon therapists offer enemas?

20:43:27
kristina
Yes, there is broad scientific evidence that the colon is a more effective delivery system than the mouth for many therapeutic agents.

20:43:59
mike j
I find that olive oil really helps lubricate for a deep and smooth colon tube insertion.

20:44:09
kristina
Yes, Larry, the implant syringe and short colon tube work excellently for delivering olive and essential oil implants.

20:44:22
Dave
Years ago, weren't some foods given rectally?

20:44:42
kristina
Some I-ACT certified colon therapists don't offer enemas; some do.

20:45:06
kristina
Thanks, Mike, for the input. Yes, that is true.

20:46:59
Don G
Well, in my search none in theses states offer enemas: NC, NJ, NY,CT, RI, MA, NH, ME.

20:47:16
kristina
The therapists that don't offer enemas probably haven't learned how to give enemas.

20:47:30
Don G
Let me know if I missed one.

20:47:58
Dave
Just a guess, but some therapists view enemas, including those done at home, a financial challenger.

20:48:37
kristina
There are multiple links on my website regarding colonic administration and its effectiveness. One that comes to mind is entitled, Colonic antigen administration induces significantly higher humoral levels of colonic and vaginal IgA, and serum IgG compared to oral administration.

20:49:04
Dave
Yes, enema knowledge is much less than the '50s and before.

20:49:17
kristina
I am a bit of a maverick in the field of offering enemas as part of a colon hydrotherapy practice.

20:49:35
kristina
I am working with other colon hydrotherapists to offer enema therapy within their practice.

20:49:49
kristina
I came to offer it because a trusted client ask me to offer the service.

20:50:07
Dave
I think there would be a market for it.

20:50:19
kristina
Absolutely, there is a market for it.

20:50:37
Dave
Me included, LOL.

20:50:47
kristina
We do have a lot of educational materials about taking enemas on our websites.

20:51:06
kristina
Also, we can give you guidance around taking enemas via the phone or Skype.

20:51:14
Larry H
It was a shock to me to see an article in our health club newsletter about the benefits of colon hydrotherapy, by Dr. Julia Whipkey-Michniewicz.

20:51:27
kristina
What state is that?

20:51:32
Larry H
Illinois

20:51:37
kristina
Nice.

20:51:39
Larry H
Rockford

20:51:51
kristina
Is that how you learned about colon cleansing?

20:52:12
Dave
Not far from Madison.

20:52:20
Larry H
It got my interest and then I found your site while surfing.

20:52:46
kristina
You'll have to thank your club for sharing the information for me.

20:53:18
kristina
Next live chat with DeeDee is in two weeks at noon, April 27th.

20:53:23
Larry H
I'll e-mail you the link.

20:53:31
kristina
Thank you, Larry.

20:54:37
Larry H
Very informative site and chat...thanks everyone!

20:55:15
kristina
You are welcome, Larry. I look forward to hearing more from you.

20:55:45
Don G
Kristina, enemas could be a very lucative service in the colon irrigation business, but I fear many CTs find giving them too personal. You are unique and a pioneer. (I wish I was closer then 1000 miles.) Please pass the word in your industry.

20:55:48
kristina
Anyone else have any questions or comments or stories they would like to share before I shut down the chat?

20:56:19
kristina
Thanks, Don, I actually gave a talk on the subject at my regional I-ACT meeting this past fall.

20:56:37
Don G
Great.. keep pushing.

20:56:50
Dave
How was the reception?

20:56:58
kristina
I need to get myself to the national I-ACT conventions but the date conflicts with a music institute that I go to every year and the Midwest Energy Fair. 

20:57:17
kristina
I was VERY well-received.

20:58:01
kristina
Welcome, Naya. We are just closing the chat but feel free to post something quickly, if you wish. We started at 7pm, CT.

20:58:31
Dave
If they appreciated lots of folks  journey to Madison for the therapy.

20:58:39
Naya F
Oops, I thought I was just an hour behind here in CA... See you next time.

20:58:50
Don G
Thanks Kristina ...see you again..god bless

20:58:51
kristina
Yep, we are two hours ahead of you. 

20:59:04
kristina
I will look forward to getting to know you more next time.

20:59:12
kristina
You are welcome, Don.

20:59:28
TaraM
Kristina, are you still here?

20:59:38
TaraM
I just had a really quick question.

20:59:39
kristina
Hi TaraM.

20:59:46
kristina
We are just closing now but I am open for a quick post, so sure.

20:59:57
TaraM
Thanks.

21:00:05
TaraM
I just got off of a 19-hour bus ride!

21:00:09
TaraM
Ate too much salty foods.

21:00:16
TaraM
My ankles are swollen as big as my head.

21:00:22
TaraM
I feel really bloated as well.

21:00:32
TaraM
Been drinking a ton of water but not peeing much.

21:00:35
TaraM
??

21:00:53
TaraM
I need my ankles to go down. What should I do?

21:01:05
kristina
I'm sorry. These are not easy issues to respond to. I will think on it for a minute and offer you something. 

21:01:09
kristina
How is your overall health?

21:01:16
TaraM
Overall excellent.

21:01:25
TaraM
I think it was just that bus ride and too much salt.

21:01:35
TaraM
Height/weight proportionate, etc.

21:01:40
TaraM
No health issues otherwise.

21:02:06
TaraM
I noticed when I took some of my Omega 3 6 9 pills they went down somewhat the next morning

21:03:52
kristina
Place ice on the ankles and   elevate your legs.

21:04:17
TaraM
Oh OK. 

21:04:23
TaraM
I will try that.

21:04:28
TaraM
Anything to take internally?

21:05:29
kristina
Just the extra water.

21:05:42
TaraM
OK, thanks! Have a good night!

21:05:44
kristina
Good luck. You should feel a lot better by tomorrow, if you don't give us a call.

21:05:49
kristina
You are welcome.

21:05:51
TaraM
Thanks so much!
