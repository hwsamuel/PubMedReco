Hi DeeDee

13:07:56

Welcome Paul.

Hi DeeDee.

13:08:36
deedee
Welcome Randy.

13:08:46
randyu
Hi there all...

13:09:10
deedee
I have been so busy here at the center, that I really do not have a topic in my head for today.  Does anyone have a topic to discuss or questions about anything?

13:09:19
clintc
I have a question about how much Celtic sea salt and how much castile soap to use in quart of water (for an enema)?

13:09:26
Larry
Can't stay on too long but an FYI....Followed your recommendations on essential oils and coffee enemas for last 2 wks.  The chemo side problems are very minimal this time around...Thanks.

13:10:26
deedee
That is great to hear, Larry.  Can you let everyone know exactly what you did?

13:10:33
deedee
Welcome Carl.

13:10:39
randyu
Mine is on cleansing... I do it at home. IBS is OK for a few days, then back again.

13:11:30
clintc
Also, I have a question about coffee enemas: the Gerson therapy people seem to recommend 3 tbs of coffee and 1 quart of water (total), much less than you recommend. Is that because the coffee you sell is high in caffeine?

13:12:29
clintc
Also, how do you tell the maximum amount of water you can take in an enema? I was going to try a gallon, but in your videos you use at most 3 quarts?

13:12:46
Larry
Daily enema series w/ coffee as the last option.  Used lavender, orange, tree tea, and/or lemon grass in the coffee.  Also found that a final small retention solution w/ a probiotic kept &quot;everything&quot; in balance.

13:13:49
randyu
All of these are good questions on cleansing...

13:14:12
deedee
Yes, our coffee is high in caffeine.  There are several ways you can make it.  I will be meeting with Dr. Vickors at the end of March.  He worked directly with Gerson and I will get his take on things and tell him what I am doing.

13:14:16
deedee
I will have more to report on that.

13:14:35
randyu
Why not decaf for coffee enemas?  

13:14:57
deedee
You can definitely try for one gallon.  Your body will tell you if it can't take that much.  I do have clients that can take that much.

13:15:25
deedee
For Celtic sea salt, 1 tsp. per quart - same with castile soap.

13:15:33
clintc
So it will backflow if you are overdoing it, or just very uncomfortable?

13:15:48
randyu
Both backflow and cramping... I know.

13:16:11
Larry
One small question on a retention solution using the probiotic... I've been using a small amount of salt in it to aid retention/absorption.  Just wondering if the salt would harm the bacteria of the probiotic?

13:16:14
clintc
Thanks, Randy.

13:16:42
deedee
That is great, Larry. Thank you for sharing that.

13:17:04
clintc
If we follow the Gerson recommendation for only quart of water, is it going to stimulate the liver? Does it go that far in?

13:18:49
clintc
Also, the Gerson people recommend several coffee enemas per day. Is that necessary?

13:19:02
deedee
Caffeine is an element along with palmitic acid that make the coffee enema work.  It stimulates the gallbladder and liver for detox purposes - relaxes the bile ducts.

13:19:52
Paul M.
I use only a quart of purified water and it seems to do the job.  Sometimes I stand on my head then lay on one side then another.

13:20:32
clintc
Thanks, Paul. Also, the Gerson people recommend distilled water. Is that better/worse than spring water?

13:20:43
deedee
It will get very uncomfortable to hold more water and you may start to leak it out or just be desperate for the toilet.  You can train your body to take in more over time, but I would not go above 4 qts. - it isn't really necessary.

13:21:11
clintc
Thanks, DeeDee.

13:21:53
deedee
Clint, you only use a small amount of water for a coffee implant/enema.  The larger enemas are the water and soap or essential oil enemas and they can be larger because you want the colon cleaned out, but the coffee/water does not need to be that large.

13:22:19
clintc
I see.

13:22:34
deedee
I only use about 2-3 cups total liquid/coffee for the implant or third enema.  It is absorbed through the colon walls, and we don't want that one up high.

13:22:49
clintc
But I could have sworn that Kristina was doing 3 quarts coffee in the video?

13:23:07
clintc
I see.

13:23:08
Paul M.
I've done 4 quarts but only every so often.  I have to ask myself whether this is really necessary.

13:23:23
clintc
Thanks, Paul.

13:23:54
deedee
Paul, that would be interesting seeing you on your head!  The coffee only needs to get up to where the descending and transverse colon meet (approx).

13:23:59
deedee
This is where the absorption to the liver occurs, and does not need to go and shouldn't go over to the liver side of the colon.

13:24:01
randyu
I only use 2-3 cups of water for a cleansing enema at a time.  That works.

13:24:36
clintc
Thanks, Randy.

13:25:01
deedee
Randy, that is good if you only need a little stimulation for a bowel movement or to only clean out the rectum and sigmoid, but it doesn't clean the entire colon.

13:25:33
clintc
DeeDee, do you use distilled water?

13:26:07
Paul M.
It's not coffee, just water, and just for a few seconds.

13:26:20
randyu
Yes, I know, I can't get much more in me at a time; a pint or so.  I can hold it a while that way.  Is this normal or what can I do different?

13:26:29
deedee
Gerson does recommend several coffee enemas per day if you are really trying to heal from cancer, etc.  For the average person, you may only need or want one per week, etc. 

13:27:02
deedee
OK, Paul, thanks for clarifying.

13:27:23
deedee
Randy, what is in the water?

13:27:31
clintc
I am on a 60-day raw juice fast, and getting almost no fiber, so I am going to try to do at least one a day.

13:27:33
randyu
How often can I do the cleansing series for IBS?  Plain water.

13:27:45
deedee
Clint, that is a good idea.

13:28:09
randyu
I use plain water, no adding.

13:28:09
clintc
Saw the movie Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead.

13:28:29
randyu
Tell us about that move, Clint.

13:28:30
clintc
That is where the juice fast came from.

13:28:53
deedee
Randy, use filtered water and 1 tsp. of Celtic sea salt per quart.  This can be more comfortable to take more in.  Would you be able to do that daily for about 2 weeks and then we could re-evaluate?

13:29:04
clintc
Well, two guys go on a raw juice fast for 60 days and get off their meds and lose a LOT of weight.

13:29:31
clintc
I think it is on Netflix.

13:29:54
deedee
That is a great and inspiring movie.  Made a lot of people really think

13:29:56
randyu
Do this every day for 2 weeks?  No side effect here?  What is Celtic sea salt?

13:30:08
clintc
DeeDee, do you recommend distilled water? Or spring water?

13:30:50
randyu
Yes I can try daily for 2 weeks and then get back to you.

13:31:06
randyu
Clint, that movie sounds good. Get off the meds!!!

13:31:08
deedee
Randy, there should be no side effects.  If you are concerned or have questions during doing this, please email me.  The Celtic sea salt we do sell on our website.

13:31:19
deedee
It is full of minerals which the colon/body needs and readily absorbs when needed and keeps electrolytes balanced.

13:32:25
Carl W
What about using sea salt in a coffee enema? Would you recommend doing that?

13:32:43
deedee
Spring water is better because it still contains its natural minerals.  Distilling removes the minerals and leaves the water trying to pull minerals from other sources to complete the molecules.

13:32:45
randyu
Can I use plain table salt, DeeDee?  How about tap water?

13:33:01
clintc
DeeDee, on the video you sell, Kristina inserts a colon tube about 10 inches. I tried about 2 or 3 inches and it didn't leak. Is it necessary to insert it 10 inches?

13:33:27
deedee
This can be helpful for short periods of time during a heavy metal detox, but it depends on what the water was distilled in.  If glass, good, but if in metal, it will pick up the molecules from the metal it is in.

13:34:25
randyu
OK to put sea salt in the red bag made of rubber?

13:34:27
clintc
I see.

13:34:43
deedee
Do not use table salt or tap water.  Table salt is dead salt with no minerals other than sodium and iodine (which is added in).  Tap water contains chlorine and fluoride -- not what you want in your colon and absorbed into your system.

13:35:06
deedee
Yes, you can put sea salt in your rubber or latex bag.

13:35:33
randyu
OK, thanks DeeDee.

13:35:55
Carl W
What about using filtered tap water?

13:36:01
deedee
Carl, yes, you can use sea salt in your coffee enema.  About the same ratio of 1 tsp. per quart.

13:36:35
randyu
Good question Carl. DeeDee, what filter can I use to for tap water?

13:36:42
randyu
Brita filters?

13:37:10
Carl W
I use the Zero.

13:37:31
randyu
What is the Zero and where can I get it?  Home Depot?

13:38:14
Carl W
I use the Zero Water filter system. It seems to filter really well.

13:38:36
clintc
Amazon has it.

13:38:41
Carl W
I got my system at Bed Bath and Beyond. You can also get it at Amazon.

13:38:43
randyu
Tell me more, Carl, about Zero.  

13:40:12
Carl W
The systems comes with an electronic gadget that measures total dissolved solids. It measures Zero with a new filter. You change filters when the reading is 6 or more.

13:40:20
clintc
How do you know when you have expelled all of the water from an enema? Is it just from practice?

13:40:32
deedee
Zero is good. I have also looked into PUR.  I am not sure what is the best.

13:41:00
deedee
Carl, do you know what Zero all removes?

13:41:29
randyu
Clint, good question.  DeeDee, how do I know I got all the water I retained out?

13:41:38
clintc
DeeDee, have you tested PUR with the water test kits you sell?

13:41:44
Carl W
It has 5 levels of filtering, and removes dissolved solids. Not sure what else.

13:42:05
deedee
Clint, sometimes you don't know and the body may hold onto some or absorb some and you will urinate it out later.  If you use a stool at your toilet and put your feet up on it and also massage your abdomen, this can help you get the water out.

13:42:20
randyu
What are the cost of filter system?

13:42:21
deedee
You will also be able to tell more as you go and get used to how you feel after.

13:42:37
clintc
Thanks, DeeDee.

13:42:46
Carl W
About $35.

13:42:48
clintc
Randy, try Amazon.

13:43:01
deedee
Clint, we do not sell water test kits.  We did many years ago, but they are so readily available at places now, so people can find them easily.

13:43:09
Paul M.
I have an R/O system and I get 97.5% of the totally dissolved solids out.  Had it tested.

13:43:36
clintc
OK. Thanks, DeeDee. And how about only inserting a colon tube 2 or 3 inches?

13:44:06
randyu
Paul, what is an R/O system?

13:44:17
deedee
Paul, that is great.  Make sure you add sea salt to your water then to replace your minerals when doing enemas.

13:44:43
clintc
Reverse osmosis.

13:44:57
randyu
Clint, the tube nozzle should go in more than 2 to 3 inches.

13:45:13
deedee
Clint, you can insert a colon tube as far as you'd like, but if you are only going to go in a couple of inches, you may find a nozzle works better - less likely to slip out.

13:45:34
Carl W
I have been getting colonics about once per week, and have the colon therapist give me a coffee enema afterwards. She inserts the colon tube about 12 inches. That seems to work well for me.

13:45:35
clintc
Thanks, DeeDee.

13:45:50
clintc
Thanks, Carl.

13:45:53
deedee
Colon tubes are made to go into the body further up into the colon.

13:45:59
Paul M.
When I put sea salt in, all the water does not come out.  But I drink minerals afterwards, that's for sure.  

13:46:00
clintc
I see.

13:46:30
deedee
That is good, Paul.

13:46:43
randyu
I drink Gatorade after, too.  Replace minerals.

13:47:36
clintc
I have to run. Thanks, everyone for all your expertise. Bye.

13:48:12
deedee
Thanks, Clint.

13:48:38
deedee
Randy, try coconut water  - better for you and no added sugars or artificial anything!

13:49:32
randyu
DeeDee, when I start daily cleansing, should I retain the water or let it go?

13:51:14
deedee
For cleansing enemas, hold no more than a few minutes and then let go.  For retaining enemas after cleansing - you can hold those longer.

13:52:43
randyu
Does it matter what position I take these in?  Whatever is comfortable?

13:54:41
Carl W
I have to go. Thanks, DeeDee. Bye.

13:54:51
Larry
Earlier? About salt in the probiotic retention mix?

13:55:00
deedee
Whatever is comfortable and allows you to take in the most water.  Some people will move around during the enema to disperse the water and it may make taking more water more comfortable.

13:55:11
deedee
Welcome, Don.

13:55:18
don g
Hi.

13:55:21
deedee
Thanks, Carl - see you next time.

13:55:54
deedee
I usually do not use salt in the probiotic implant, but just water or aloe vera juice.

13:56:22
randyu
Thanks, DeeDee. If I run into a problem, I will email you or call.

13:56:56
Larry
Same for me but thought the salt might just aid absorption but was wondering about salt harming the bacteria.

13:57:38
deedee
Sounds good, Randy.

13:58:02
deedee
Yes, Larry, I am not sure what the salt would do to the bacteria or if it would affect it in any way.

13:58:19
Larry
OK... Thanks for the chat.

13:58:27
randyu
OK, thanks for all the info; really helpful today.  Bye all...

13:59:31
don g
Got here too late... I will read the archive... See you again...

13:59:49
deedee
Thank you - bye everyone.  Not sure when the next one will be. Just check the website for the date.

14:00:01
deedee
Sorry about that, Don!
