Hi there 

17:55:14&nbsp; 
kristina 
Hello! 

17:55:42&nbsp; 
billythekid 
Nice to back on the chat after a long tax season 

17:56:10&nbsp; 
kristina 
Are you a tax accountant? 

17:56:43&nbsp; 
billythekid 
Yes, I specialize in individual returns  

17:57:10&nbsp; 
michael b 
a most wonderful spring to all 

17:58:49&nbsp;

Hi Lisa 

17:59:56&nbsp; 
Lisa 
I'm just here to say a quick hello to everyone. I have a student coming soon so I can't stay. I'm leaving tomorrow for Padre Island for a much needed vacation on the beach!! 

18:00:21&nbsp; 
billythekid 
Have a good time! 

18:00:24&nbsp; 
michael b 
kristina, looks like you are as busy as ever - any new neat stuff? 

18:00:37&nbsp; 
Lisa 
Thanks Billy! 

18:01:29&nbsp; 
kristina 
Yes, do have an excellent trip, Lisa. And, thanks for saying hello. 

18:01:47&nbsp; 
kristina 
We have many new things brewing! 

18:02:00&nbsp; 
kristina 
We will soon be launching a new enemabag.com 

18:02:01&nbsp; 
Lisa 
You're welcome! I wish I could stay longer! 

18:03:15&nbsp; 
kristina 
This new enema-related site will be much easier to navigate, will be more beautiful, full of very useful enema-related information -- how to take a coffee enema, how to clean your enema equipment, an enema equipment buying guide, and more. 

18:03:35&nbsp; 
kristina 
And, we will also be launching a new optimalhealthnetwork.com. 

18:04:01&nbsp; 
kristina 
On Friday I will be spending the day taking new pictures of our entire colon cleansing stock! 

18:04:33&nbsp; 
kristina 
Can anyone give me a report on the new silicone colon tube? 

18:04:58&nbsp; 
kristina 
We also have a number of new enema bag systems with a free DVD: &quot;All About Enemas&quot; 

18:05:53&nbsp; 
kristina 
I was just in Seattle at a Re-Evaluation Counseling Intensive for a week, and then I spent the weekend on the Olympic Pennisula. 

18:06:16&nbsp; 
kristina 
Please do email me about that one, Mike. Okay? 

18:06:45&nbsp; 
kristina 
Seattle and the surrounding area is sure a spectacular place to be. 

18:06:55&nbsp; 
Mike K 
Just teasing :-) 

18:08:30&nbsp; 
Lisa 
I'm sorry - you'll have one less person here, but I have to go. I hope more people will join in! I was in Seattle in March and it's one of the most beautiful in the country!  

18:09:00&nbsp; 
kristina 
Before I forget, I want to remind folks that starting in June, the Live Chat will be held at 8 pm CST. I am hoping this will work better for all those who wish to be involved. 

18:09:14&nbsp; 
kristina 
Welcome, Joseph. 

18:09:29&nbsp; 
Lisa 
I plan on being at the chat next month if you really are starting the chat at 8pm. Bye for now! 

18:09:31&nbsp; 
Joseph 
Thank you. hello kris 

18:09:38&nbsp; 
billythekid 
I am sure it will be more active. 

18:10:11&nbsp; 
kristina 
Hello. 

18:11:21&nbsp; 
kristina 
I recently received the following note from a customer. It is so inspiring that I wanted to share it with all of you tonight: &quot;It has been almost four months since I first tried the enema series you folks suggested.  The intestinal gas pains have gone completely and regularity has returned.  I just thought you might like to hear that it worked for me even though some folks thought I was a little kooky.&quot; 

18:12:57&nbsp; 
Mike K 
Anybody have any comment about a picture area in the forum showing equipment and such? 

18:13:47&nbsp; 
kristina 
This leads into a thread that I would like to start on this chat, the colon health forum, and future chats: Do you all share your &quot;health secrets&quot; with those around you in order to assist them to improve their own health? Do you have any stories where you assisted someone else to improve their health using colon cleansing or dietary changes? Do you have a person in mind who you know would benefit from these ideas, but you feel too shy to encourage them along the lines of enemas, colon implants, coffee enemas, raw dairy, staying away from grains, and the like? 

18:13:48&nbsp; 
billythekid 
I would have no problem with it at all. 

18:15:46&nbsp; 
michael b 
i bought a new silicone tube, but i am really busy getting my ducks in a row, so i will get back to you. there is no way i can start to explain the loss of stress. 

18:15:47&nbsp; 
Mike K 
I have loaned two of your CDs to six different people  

18:16:38&nbsp; 
kristina 
Thank you, Mike. What did they have to say afterwards? 

18:16:58&nbsp; 
michael b 
from this job. 

18:17:40&nbsp; 
Mike K 
two of them were very embarrassed about talking about bowel problems 

18:17:54&nbsp; 
kristina 
Michael, I know just what you are talking about. Living a life without taking on all the external stressors is a much better place to live in than when we let the day-to-day challenges get to us. The work I did in Seattle really helped me shifted my perspective. 

18:18:08&nbsp; 
Mike K 
and two of them didn't say much at all, and the other two still have the CDs 

18:20:17&nbsp; 
kristina 
For instance, I hadn't realized how much I let the challenges that my business has been going through pull up the early trauma in my life. Now, instead of vibrating at &quot;This is so HARD!&quot; I can take the perspective that all businesses go through challenges and I have the rest of my life to handle this, and things will work out because I am absolutely brilliant, talented, and hard-working to boot! 

18:20:23&nbsp; 
kristina 
What have you been going through? 

18:20:33&nbsp; 
Mike K 
Kristina,  did you know that the Klystra douche bulb with the two nozzles makes a good sinus irrigation syringe?  

18:20:57&nbsp; 
kristina 
No, I did not. How do you know? 

18:21:09&nbsp; 
Mike K 
I use one 

18:21:48&nbsp; 
kristina 
Did the 6 people you lent the movies to have bowel-related problems? What made you think to lend the movies to begin with? 

18:22:10&nbsp; 
kristina 
Do you have sinus problems? What solution do you use in the sinuses? 

18:22:24&nbsp; 
kristina 
How often do you take the sinus irrigations? 

18:22:57&nbsp; 
Mike K 
They are husband and wife - one was having bowel troubles and the other one saw one of my websites that I was working on 

18:23:05&nbsp; 
kristina 
Another enema-related testimonial: 

18:23:07&nbsp; 
kristina 
&quot;I just wanted leave a comment.  Anyone who has ever wasted their time, health, and little money on cheap drug store enema bags.. STOP! The products sold here are truly professional and top-of-the-line.  I wish I had found this website years ago.  Taking an enema with these bags, tubes, and soaps can really be relaxing and satisfying.  I never thought I would feel this way about an enema. This website is so wonderful. Thank you -- $50, $60, $70 so well spent. I will be a customer for life!&quot;   

18:23:52&nbsp; 
Mike K 
it really depends on how bad the allergy season is 

18:24:01&nbsp; 
kristina 
Okay, here is another topic: 

18:24:26&nbsp; 
kristina 
This is from an email that I recently sent to one of the health practitioners that I have been studying with: 

18:24:33&nbsp; 
kristina 
&quot;For the past number of months, I have been struggling with lots of numbness and tingling which starts when I am sleeping or sitting but doesn?t go away.&quot; 

18:24:42&nbsp; 
kristina 
And here is what I learned: 

18:25:06&nbsp; 
kristina 
those signs are common in hypothyroidism 

18:25:35&nbsp; 
kristina 
So I increased my Armour Thyroid, and the numbness and tingling in my arms and legs went away! 

18:26:06&nbsp; 
kristina 
Here are a few scientific articles that back this up: 

18:26:38&nbsp; 
kristina 
 J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry. 1975 Mar;38(3):241-7.  Myxoedematous polyneuropathy: a light and electron microscopic study of the peripheral nerve and muscle. Shirabe T, Tawara S, Terao A, Araki S. Histopathological findings of biopsied peripheral nerve and muscle were studied in a case with myxoedematous polyneuropathy. The most striking findings in the sural nerve were segmental demyelination and onion bulb formation with scanty mucinous deposits in addition to marked loss of large myelinated nerve fibres. The peroneus brevis muscle revealed the association of neuropathic and myopathic changes. It is suggested that myxoedematous polyneuropathy might be intrinsic neuropathy due to metabolic disorder of Schwann cells related to hypothyroidism, resulting in segmental demyelination, not merely compressive neuropathy due to mucinous deposits in the peripheral nerves. 

18:26:49&nbsp; 
Mike K 
Did you know that a goat herder is called a capriculturist? 

18:27:05&nbsp; 
kristina 
Minerva Med. 1983 Feb 11;74(5):165-72.  [Hypothyroid neuropathy. Description 2 cases] [Article in Italian] Zampollo A, Cristofori E, Zacchetti O, Spreafico A. Although neurological complications of hypothyroidism are well recognized, scanty data, to the best of our knowledge, are available about peripheral neuropathies in this condition. The electrographic studies so far performed are nearly all devoted to the well known association myxoedema-carpal tunnel syndrome. Our data concern two patients affected by neuropathy in hypothyroidism, presenting diffuse anomalies of electrographic parameters (motor and sensitive nerve conduction velocity, F-wave, H-reflex, H-index); and, in one of these cases, a marked segmental demyelination and axonal degenerations were disclosed by pathological examination of sural nerve (according to Dyck and Lambert, 1970; Shirabe and coll., 1975).  

18:27:29&nbsp; 
kristina 
No, I did not. That is fun. I will let my husband, Farmer Tim, the goat farmer know.

Deficiency of thyroid hormone during central nervous system ontogeny results in a variety of clinical, anatomical and biochemical defects. Delay in thyroxine therapy in newborns with congenital hypothyroidism leads to irreversible brain damage. We have used localized in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to assess biochemical changes in different regions of brain in three patients with congenital hypothyroidism before and after thyroxine therapy. An abnormal lipid peak which disappeared with thyroxine therapy was observed in cerebellum and frontal lobe in one patient. Statistically significant reduction of NAA/(Cr+PCr) [P

Goat ranchers etc are called capriculturists 

18:28:33&nbsp;

Mike, you were a goat farmer as a kid, yeah?  

18:29:43&nbsp; 
billythekid 
What is the sural nerve? 

18:30:00&nbsp; 
Mike K 
Sure was

I was wondering if there is a good enema solution for a stomach ache? 

18:34:44&nbsp; 
kristina 
I do plan to make another enema movie in the next while. Here are some excerpts: 

18:34:47&nbsp; 
billythekid 
Thank you. Have you ever been asked about Restless Leg Syndrome in your practice of healing things with colon therapy and enemas? 

18:35:07&nbsp; 
kristina 
Short Film: High Enema  Scene: KA standing in front of the treatment room door with chart behind for reference: &quot;Hello, my name is Kristina Amelong and I am a nationally certified colon therapist. Today I?m going to show you how to take a high enema.&quot;  KA points to chart: &quot;This is the colon. It is approximately 5 feet long and 2 1/2 inches in diameter. Typically an enema flushes only the lower portion of the colon, usually from the rectum through sigmoid colon.  With a high enema we are going to move about 1 gallon of water all the way over to the ascending colon. This will approximate what happens when you have a colonic.  I recommend at least using a 1-gallon enema bag and either a balloon nozzle like this or  a colon tube.  The colon tube (referring to the chart) if inserted will end here and inject water starting here, keeping pressure off the rectum until the whole colon is filled. This allows taking more water. Care needs to be used with this tube. 

18:35:26&nbsp; 
kristina 
Hello, Carol. I am so glad that you have joined us. I was missing you! 

18:36:10&nbsp; 
Carol45 
Just got home from work and then AGONIZED thru a Java upload.  I've been missing all of you! 

18:36:14&nbsp; 
billythekid 
Hi Carol 

18:36:32&nbsp; 
kristina 
Yes, I have worked with Restless Leg Syndrome many times. The first place to start is with magnesium supplementation. 

18:36:47&nbsp; 
kristina 
Thanks for making it happen, Carol.  

18:37:06&nbsp; 
kristina 
Joseph, 

18:37:46&nbsp; 
kristina 
Often a stomach ache is really a colon ache, so a water and salt enema can often ameliorate the symptoms. 

18:37:57&nbsp; 
kristina 
Are you having a stomach ache now? 

18:38:08&nbsp; 
kristina 
Do you have any idea why? 

18:38:26&nbsp; 
kristina 
If I can get more information, I am more able to offer a personal solution that will work well. 

18:38:43&nbsp; 
kristina 
Sorry, but I have to pee....I will be right back. 

18:39:39&nbsp; 
Carol45 
I don't see the beginning of the Chat - but have heard that Vitamin E helps with leg cramps.  Sorry if I'm going over already covered territory.  

18:40:14&nbsp; 
kristina 
too much goat's milk before the chat! 

18:40:29&nbsp; 
Joseph 
I've had a stomach ache for 2 days 

18:40:35&nbsp; 
michael b 
being still slow on downloading, is there any chance the small and large enema might show up on a dvd? i like bokara rug on the large volume. 

18:40:45&nbsp; 
billythekid 
Restless leg syndrome is not really a cramping thing. It is more like a spastic. 

18:40:49&nbsp; 
Joseph 
yeah, i think I ate something Monday evening 

18:40:56&nbsp; 
Joseph 
hello Carol 

18:41:02&nbsp; 
kristina 
No, you aren't Carol. Vitamin E can be an important resource for the body when dealing with leg cramps. When do the leg cramps happen and what is there frequency and intensity? 

18:41:22&nbsp; 
billythekid 
jumping. There is no pain associated with it. 

18:41:24&nbsp; 
kristina 
Have you tried an enema series yet, Joseph? 

18:41:37&nbsp; 
Joseph 
I haven't yet kris 

18:41:50&nbsp; 
Joseph 
(sorry - someone rang doorbell) 

18:42:04&nbsp; 
kristina 
Yes, once we make this last movie, we will offer the set on a DVD. Thanks for encouraging that, Mike. 

18:42:26&nbsp; 
Joseph 
Thank you, I might try a simple salt water solution 

18:43:24&nbsp; 
Mike K 
Joseph, that's what i do when I get one 

18:43:24&nbsp; 
kristina 
Yes, that is what I would do, Joseph. Also, if you could drink a little mixture of baking soda and salt, that could be helpful, too. One cup of water to 1 teaspoon of baking soda and a dash of sea salt. 

18:43:34&nbsp; 
kristina 
You might also add the peppermint to the enema solution. 

18:44:08&nbsp; 
billythekid 
The best remedy for leg cramps that I have ever found is quinine sulfate. Unfortunately they are taking it off the market and replacing it with something else. 

18:44:20&nbsp; 
kristina 
Can you describe to me in more detail how  you experience the Restless Leg Syndrome? 

18:44:50&nbsp; 
Joseph 
wow, that's great - I have all those items, of course from your store, kris :) 

18:46:53&nbsp; 
billythekid 
Yes, the calf muscle begins to react as if something was &quot;tickleing&quot; the bottom of my feet. It is impossible to prevent the leg or legs from &quot;jumping.&quot;         I have had this problem for years. It is very intermittent and unpredictable.   

18:48:01&nbsp; 
billythekid 
It is very uncomfortable, only happens at night and will kill a good night's sleep. 

18:48:34&nbsp; 
gary 
Hi everyone 

18:48:35&nbsp; 
kristina 
a year after ordering a halt to the marketing of over-the-counter (OTC) quinine sulfate for night leg cramps based on its serious risks, the FDA ordered a stop to the marketing of prescription quinine for this use because even under a doctor's care, its risks outweigh any possible benefits. 

18:49:01&nbsp; 
kristina 
It does work, but magnesium, proper diet, and regular streching also work wonders. 

18:49:02&nbsp; 
billythekid 
There does not seem to be any &quot;pattern&quot; to the times that I suffer from it.  

18:49:26&nbsp; 
kristina 
How often? 

18:49:35&nbsp; 
kristina 
Hi Gary! Welcome. 

18:49:35&nbsp; 
gary 
I get a lot of cramping in my hands.  

18:50:01&nbsp; 
Joseph 
Yoga is great for the legs 

18:50:37&nbsp; 
kristina 
Gary, you might also benefit from magnesium. How often do you get cramps in the hands? What do you do with your hands day-to-day? 

18:50:52&nbsp; 
gary 
I guess this is caused by the same thing that causes leg cramps? 

18:51:16&nbsp; 
billythekid 
Again, very intermittent. I may go several months and not suffer any &quot;attacks&quot; and then again it might hit me every night for 2 or 3 in a row. 

18:51:22&nbsp; 
gary 
A lot of computer mouse work. And electrical wiring. 

18:51:42&nbsp; 
michael b 
billy, i just have to ask you, do you know what john gotti's nickname in prison was?   mr. gotti, sir. 

18:51:46&nbsp; 
kristina 
Another reminder: Optimal Health Network's Live Chat will move to 8 p.m. Central Standard Time as of June 12th. 

18:52:15&nbsp; 
gary 
Ever think of having the chat twice a month? 

18:52:41&nbsp; 
kristina 
Billy, what I would do is as soon as it hits, take roughly 600 milligrams of magnesium citrate. If it continues, breathe into a paper bag for 30-60 minutes.  

18:53:31&nbsp; 
billythekid 
Thank you. I will try it. 

18:53:52&nbsp; 
kristina 
If it still continues, take roughly 200 mg of magnesium citrate every 1-3 hours. I bet it will pass more quickly. You might also just add 400 mg of magnesium citrate to your daily protocol for a bit. 

18:54:28&nbsp; 
gary 
I take it the magnesium citrate is for the cramps? I never heard of using that. I will try it. 

18:54:51&nbsp; 
kristina 
I have thought of having the chat more than once a month, if not weekly or daily. Once I resolve my infrastructure issues, I would like to head towards that. Please do bring it up again. 

18:55:20&nbsp; 
Joseph 
that sounds wonderful 

18:55:22&nbsp; 
gary 
I have been trying to get here for the past year, and always miss the timing. 

18:55:25&nbsp; 
gary 
This is my first time. 

18:55:31&nbsp; 
kristina 
Yes, the muscles need magnesium in order to relax properly. 

18:55:36&nbsp; 
gary 
Seattle time here 

18:55:53&nbsp; 
gary 
What about eating a lot of bananas? 

18:55:55&nbsp; 
kristina 
I am just back from Seattle. Lovely city! 

18:56:09&nbsp; 
gary 
Weather here today is spectacular 

18:56:15&nbsp; 
kristina 
Bananas tend to be constipating at large doses and are high in potassium and not magnesium. 

18:56:19&nbsp; 
Mike K 
 Gary, it would be 6pm 

18:56:35&nbsp; 
gary 
It's 4 here now. 

18:56:37&nbsp; 
kristina 
Yes, 6pm for the live chat next month, Seattle time. 

18:56:50&nbsp; 
gary 
What day next month? 

18:57:13&nbsp; 
Mike K 
Kris, I will make the change in the forum 

18:57:34&nbsp; 
kristina 
Well, I am going to close down the live chat now. Thanks everyone for joining me. I always feel so honored that you spend an hour of your month hanging out with me. Have a great rest of your month and hopefully I will hear from you all in between times. Bye for now! 

18:57:43&nbsp; 
kristina 
Always the second Wednesday of the month. 

18:57:47&nbsp; 
michael b 
kristina, magnesium citrate is an over the counter available in 200 mgs. 

18:57:49&nbsp; 
gary 
bye 

18:57:52&nbsp; 
Joseph 
Thank you, and be well all! 

18:57:53&nbsp; 
gary 
bye 

18:58:38&nbsp; 
kristina 
Yes, you can get it over the counter. Just make sure that the fillers and expedients aren't harmful to the body that they use in the capsule or tablet. 

19:00:02&nbsp; 
michael b 
kristina, you read sheet music - of course you do. more later. 

19:00:14&nbsp; 
Carol45 
My computer froze up and I had to reboot - of all nights for it to act up!  Sorry I missed out!!! 

19:01:55&nbsp; 
michael b 
no reports on the square egg machine? 

19:01:58&nbsp; 
kristina 
Bye, Carol! 

19:02:00&nbsp; 
Carol45 
I'm not seeing any messages, and my panel is very slow.  Everyone have a good evening and great month! 

19:02:48&nbsp; 
kristina 
We had a blast using the square egg machine. Thank you so very much, Michael. And, we have used many of the pairs of gloves. It most definitely makes life better to have many pair of gloves around. Thank you! 

19:03:02&nbsp; 
kristina 
We will post the chat in the next while for all to read! 

19:05:04&nbsp;
