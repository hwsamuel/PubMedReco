Hey, hiya kris :)

19:59:28
kristina
Hey, how are you? 

19:59:44
Joseph
I'm good ty, and how are you and your liver cleanse?

20:00:52
Joseph
I was wondering if you could facebook email your regimen

20:01:24
Tara
Hi Kristina and hello all

20:01:58
Joseph
Hello Tara

20:02:20
kristina
I am not sure what you exactly mean, Joseph?

20:02:26
kristina
My liver cleanse went very well. 

20:02:50
kristina
It was pretty easy. Besides a headache towards the end of the first day, I felt great.

20:03:10
Joseph
good to hear. i was wondering if you had the liver cleanse program written down, and if so... I am your friend of facebook. perhaps you could email it to me

20:03:23
Joseph
that is great. I am sure you feel great now

20:03:49
kristina
Others who also used the Ortho Molecular Core Restore Kit had similar experiences.

20:04:13
kristina
One woman who went through the process was dealing with issues of hormone overload. 

20:04:27
Tara
Kristina, I have a question for you:

20:04:33
kristina
She felt pretty crazy for a few days but reports now that she feels fantastic and her hot flashes are gone.

20:04:39
kristina
Great!

20:04:53
Tara
My veins show through my feet and the veins look puffy, so not looking forward as much to sandal season!  Please advise on what you think is causing it and do you have any remedies for it?  How can I thicken the skin so veins wonâ€™t show through my feet?

20:05:04
kristina
The entire instructions are within the Ortho Core Restore Kit. 

20:05:07
Joseph
thank you for the info

20:05:20
kristina
There is an entire booklet, so it would be tough to email the entire thing.

20:05:33
Joseph
understood, and thank you again :)

20:06:30
kristina
Tara, are you having any other symptoms of ill health?

20:06:37
Tara
not really

20:06:48
Tara
but I do sit down a whole lot

20:06:55
Tara
and really don't exercise as much as I should

20:07:22
Tara
but I am not overweight 6 feet 160

20:07:48
kristina
Do your feet fall asleep regularly?

20:08:17
kristina
Joseph, I can answer any specific questions here that you have about the liver detoxification process.

20:08:18
Tara
yeah I think they do

20:08:24
Tara
my ankles swell too

20:08:37
kristina
Okay, so we need to work on your overall circulation.

20:08:55
kristina
There are many ways to improve your circulation. 

20:09:07
Tara
I take coQ10 and iron pills, which are supposed to aid in circulation too?

20:09:08
kristina
Certainly, a great way is to include regular exercise in your life.

20:09:16
Tara
but don't take them for that specific reason though.

20:09:25
kristina
yes, both of those supplements do aid in good circulation.

20:09:33
Tara
ok, any other suggestions?

20:09:50
Tara
is there anyway to shrink the veins in my feet?

20:10:02
kristina
Cayenne pepper sprinkled on your food often, especially with protein meals.

20:10:04
Tara
what do you think is causing the veins to swell like that?

20:10:22
Tara
oh wow, I just bought a whole bottle of cayenne as well.

20:10:24
kristina
The herb Hawthorne is excellent for improving heart and circulatory health.

20:10:33
kristina
Excellent, Tara. That is fun!

20:10:53
Tara
well I used the cayenne in a honey and lemon mix to get rid of a cold.

20:11:09
Tara
but anything to reduce the appearance of the veins for now?

20:11:19
Tara
anything I can put topical on them?

20:11:22
kristina
Do you eat a lot of carbohydrates, sweets, breads?

20:11:26
Tara
yup

20:11:28
Tara
you got me!

20:11:32
Tara
lots of sweets

20:11:34
kristina
How much protein and healthy fat do you eat?

20:11:44
Tara
not a whole lot right now

20:11:57
kristina
Bring into balance these macronutrients and you will see an improvement.

20:12:21
Tara
gotta get my diet right

20:12:58
kristina
Another herb to consider is Gymnema to physiologically change your relationship to carbohydrates. It works wonders!

20:13:13
michael b
most wonderful spring to all at the chat here. i am interested in the ortho core kit, but my life is so busy, income tax, smogging my cars, and more mundane stuff, but i'm not giving on improving my life.

20:13:42
kristina
Rub peppermint oil on your feet.

20:13:47
Tara
ah, OK!

20:13:50
Tara
I will try that.

20:13:58
kristina
Also, add more garlic to your diet.

20:14:03
Tara
is that why my ankles swell as well?

20:14:12
Tara
ok, I will try that as well

20:14:28
Tara
can garlic pills work just as good, or just the actual garlic itself?

20:14:38
kristina
Take garlic pills. I like our MediHerb garlic tablets.

20:14:43
Tara
cool

20:15:18
TomE
Good evening to all from Massachusetts.

20:15:23
kristina
You have lymph congestion. Diet, lack of exercise, aging are all contributing.

20:15:35
kristina
Hello to everyone!

20:15:40
Tara
lymph congestion? whoa

20:15:53
Tara
gotta look that up

20:16:08
kristina
Do you have any arthritis?

20:16:17
Tara
no, I am 39

20:16:26
Tara
but my fingers hurt a little during the wintertime

20:16:26
kristina
great.

20:16:34
Tara
when I type a lot on the computer

20:16:51
Bee L
Hi kristina. I've been on the WAPF diet for almost 4 months, trying as hard as I can to eat like your book and am doing a great job really. Rarely I'll eat a candy bar because i do miss a little something sweet. seems like that's when constipation returns

20:17:16
kristina
I think you will feel so much better as you incorporate these healthy lifestyle changes into your day-to-day life.

20:17:38
Tara
ok Kristina, thanks for the advice!

20:17:51
kristina
Interesting, isn't it? Why do you think constipation is triggered by eating the candy bar?

20:18:18
Tara
Also, do you have any advice on how to grow lashes?  I have heard a lot about Latisse and know of people who use it and swear by it, but it is expensive ($150 per month).

20:18:38
Bee L
Good question.  has been my nemesis for 25 years and improved greatly on WAPF diet, but started up again.

20:18:49
kristina
Gymnema would also be useful for you, Bee, to help your cells become more receptive to the sugar that is naturally present in the foods that you eat.

20:19:09
Bee L
what's that? A supplement?

20:19:10
kristina
Sorry, Tara, I don't.

20:19:12
TomE
Kristina, I find that using goat milk soap in my water tends to seem to make it harder for me to take my normal amounts of liquid during enemas. Do others have this issue? I like to use it to loosen things, but my system seems to fight it.

20:19:21
Tara
ok, thanks!

20:19:51
kristina
Do you always use the enema soap in the first enema or do you wait until the second enema in the series?

20:20:16
Tara
Thanks Kristina - everyone have a great night!

20:20:20
TomE
normally in the first series, then peppermint sea salt and water.

20:20:26
kristina
Have you tried adding the sea salt to the enema and goat milk soap solution?

20:20:42
kristina
Bye, Tara, I hope to hear from you soon!

20:20:59
kristina
How do you do with the peppermint and sea salt?

20:21:05
Tara
Thanks! I will still order those hair analysis tests soon!

20:21:07
TomE
yes, does not really help - I also find it seems to tighten my colon for getting my colon tube in for second and third series.

20:21:45
TomE
If I just use sea salt and peppermint, I don't have the problems.  

20:22:11
michael b
Kristina, you talked about taking chlorophyll for protein - what kind of chlorophyll?

20:22:13
kristina
Take the peppermint and sea salt enema solution into your body during your first enema in the series.

20:22:25
kristina
And add sea salt with the enema soap enema.

20:23:00
TomE
I will try that next session - seeing Dee Dee next week.

20:23:13
kristina
There are many different types of chlorophyll on the market. I prefer our Standard Process chlorophyll.

20:24:08
TomE
What's the real difference in using the peppermint versus lavender essential oils?

20:24:38
kristina
It is made from sesame seeds, alfalfa, sunflower.

20:25:25
TomE
Is there any real issue with using warm water for all the enema series?

20:26:19
michael b
thank you - i am looking at one of the boxes of the same that you sell.

20:28:50
VinceB
If too strong a solution with goat milk soap, I have experienced the same tightening of the colon.  What is a safe mixture?

20:30:20
TomE
I've tried from fairly quick time with soap dissolving to stronger and at least when used on first series tends to cause me issues.  i will see if doing it second will work.

20:32:01
TomE
would your liquid soap be milder?

20:34:15
TomE
castile soap series?

20:34:24
kristina
sorry, I am back!

20:34:36
kristina
Great, Tom!

20:34:55
kristina
I personally prefer peppermint.

20:35:10
kristina
In other words, largely, it is personal preference.

20:35:35
kristina
There are reportedly different affects on the body of peppermint and lavender. 

20:36:02
TomE
I have mixed them on occasions.

20:36:28
michael b
Kristina, will you be talking more about the core restore kit and improvements by use of this liver revitalizing?

20:37:43
TomE
I find water temps 102-104 work better for me and I can take larger amounts of liquid when I keep it warmer.

20:38:01
Vincec
Kristina, your chat site is acting up.  If no action is taken, it tosses you off.

20:38:02
Joseph
I agree, Tom.

20:38:15
kristina
There are scientific studies that peppermint reduces bowel inflammation.

20:38:16
Joseph
I personally like 109.

20:38:31
kristina
Anyone else having this issue?

20:38:44
kristina
Mixing them is fine.

20:38:47
TomE
I thought 104 was consider the warmest you should use in colon?

20:38:55
michael b
not yet

20:39:14
Vincec
no... 110 is max for me.

20:39:18
Joseph
no issues here.

20:39:18
kristina
104 is the warmest water I would use, but there are certainly individual differences in temperature tolerance.

20:39:21
TomE
so far no problem

20:39:54
kristina
Vince, try using a different browser like Safari instead of Firefox.

20:40:06
Vincec
Will do.  Thanks.

20:40:24
TomE
So a little warmer than 104 is not directly harmful?

20:40:38
Vincec
Depends on the individual.

20:41:13
Bee L
Which should come first, Core Restore or Immuno Support? Can yo do them both at the same time?

20:41:22
kristina
peppermint also promotes better digestion and mental alertness.

20:42:29
Vincec
Need to call it a night.  Good topics!

20:42:31
kristina
Lavender is an adaptogen, which means it helps the body adapt to stressors.

20:42:41
TomE
Do you use peppermint in last series? I don't always have option for coffee and use water mix instead.

20:42:43
kristina
Thanks, Vince. Thanks for coming tonight.

20:42:46
Joseph
Yes, I love the peppermint oil.

20:42:51
kristina
Sure, you can do it.

20:43:22
TomE
I usually use 2 drops per quart of water.

20:43:29
Joseph
I am off as well, good night all.

20:43:46
kristina
Bee, can you give me a better idea of your health situation?

20:46:26
TomE
are we still online?

20:46:28
kristina
Since using the Core Restore Kit, I have increased the rate of my bowel movements from 1 time per day to 2 to 3 times per day.

20:46:40
kristina
yes

20:46:45
Bee L
Weaker immune system, sluggish liver I think.  no gallstones, etc.,  just had an ultrasound and bloodwork. everything ok.  25 years of irregularity. Former mostly veg, now full on WAP.

20:47:28
kristina
Hello Catcoland.

20:47:52
kristina
I would start with the Core Restore Kit.

20:48:14
Bee L
Cool.  i'm on it!  thanks.

20:48:16
kristina
FYI - WAP means a Weston A. Price diet.

20:48:22
kristina
You are very welcome.

20:48:41
Bee L
i just want my energy back so i can exercise again!

20:50:29
kristina
It reportedly improves stage 1 liver detoxification. One might experience an improvement in liver detoxification capacities by not being chemically sensitive, feeling happy, not feeling tired upon rising, improved digestion.

20:50:41
kristina
This can absolutely happen, Bee!

20:50:59
michael b
since being aware, my consumption of peppermint tea has skyrocketed - also there are great recipes, with calorie count in the core kit.

20:51:41
kristina
Improving bowel function is most definitely a sign of improved liver function.

20:52:12
kristina
Thanks for posting that information about recipes in the Core Restore Kit.

20:52:28
kristina
Anytime you want to throw in stuff like that, you go ahead!

20:52:35
TomE
is tablespoon per qt a good level for sea salt?

20:52:42
kristina
teaspoon

20:52:52
TomE
roger, my typo

20:54:09
kristina
Next Live Chat, April 28th at noon

20:54:59
kristina
Welcome, herk.

20:55:00
TomE
thanks. will try to make the daytime version.  not always where i can.

20:55:08
Bee L
Great to know.  I will order it for sure, as well as the Vit-ra-tox kit. What is the best tube to get to do high implant cocktails? You have so many things to sort through.

20:55:12
kristina
We are just about to close out, but we would love to hear from you.

20:55:39
kristina
30 inch, 32 FR colon tube is a perfect place to start.

20:55:47
michael b
I have the whole core restore kit, but my life has to be a little more organized to proceed with this change.

20:55:52
kristina
Wait on the Vit-Ra-Tox kit.

20:56:08
TomE
i am going to get your new 60 in on my madison visit.

20:56:38
kristina
It isn't a small deal, Michael, to partake of a fast and then a course of regular supplements and therapeutic diet.

20:56:38
Bee L
Ok.  I'm on my second 10 day series now.

20:57:07
TomE
everyone have a good night 

20:57:47
kristina
Given what you have told me, go ahead the the Core Restore Program in place of the Vit-Ra-Tox as soon as you are ready, and then go back to the Ten Day Diet for another 21 days, and then do the Vit-Ra-Tox kit.

20:58:03
kristina
Bye all.

20:59:01
Bee L
Will do.  loved your book and know my issues are all colon related!  glad i stopped in for the chat!  thanks.

20:59:05
michael b
the recipes look great. thanks again.

20:59:48
Bee L
how often should i do coffee enemas?

21:00:51
michael b
everyone stay healthy - summer is on the way.
