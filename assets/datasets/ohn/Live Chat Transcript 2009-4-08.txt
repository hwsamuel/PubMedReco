The daytime chat proved to be quite busy. It was very fun. I wasn't able to even advance the topics that I had chosen for the chat there were so many questions and comments.

20:06:23&nbsp;
Kristina
What do you gentlemen have on your minds tonight?

20:06:34&nbsp;
Michael R
Coffee enemas

20:07:38&nbsp;
Michael R
My Mother had Colon cancer and I can see how colon cleansing could be a good preventable treatment to protect myself

20:07:40&nbsp;
Kristina
Go ahead, Micheal. What about coffee enemas?

20:08:09&nbsp;
michael b
Kristina, what's new with you and OHN?

20:08:16&nbsp;
Kristina
I am pondering the idea of going to live with some of our coffee growers for a couple of weeks this coming winter.

20:08:25&nbsp;
Michael R
I read yesterday about a Doctor studing Pancreatic Cancer using coffee enemas and it seems to be working

20:09:26&nbsp;
michael b
I take it that would be next year? 

20:09:27&nbsp;
Kristina
My goal would be to document the whole experience so that folks who use our enema coffee could meet the growers, see how the coffee is grown, learn about the lives of the coffee growers, learn about the economic, global and environmental issues that are involved with growing coffee.

20:09:49&nbsp;
Kristina
Dr Nicolas Gonzalez?

20:09:52&nbsp;
Dave
Interestingly, some states including mine ban therapists from giving coffee, or even soapsuds enemas because they're considered medical implants.

20:09:57&nbsp;
Kristina
What did you read about him?

20:10:01&nbsp;
Michael R
It would be good to get a good perspective from the point of the Growers

20:10:24&nbsp;
Kristina
The coffee growers that I would visit live in Guatemala.

20:11:23&nbsp;
Michael R
I do not recall his name, but his fellow Doctors are attacking him for even mentioning the use of enemas

20:11:26&nbsp;
Kristina
yes, sometime between November and April but the harvest gets done in late November to early January as I found out yesterday so we would likely visit the coffee growers during the harvest season.

20:11:41&nbsp;
Kristina
Of course, coffee enemas are very controversial.

20:12:32&nbsp;
Kristina
I have some YouTube footage now detailing the coffee enema. Have you all seen it?

20:12:44&nbsp;
Michael R
Enemas used to be standard treatment, My Mom probably had an enema when in labor with me

20:13:22&nbsp;
Michael R
I have not actually seen the videos, but I saw them listed, thank you

20:13:38&nbsp;
Joseph
Hello kris :)

20:13:44&nbsp;
Kristina
You are welcome. I think you will learn a lot by watching the YouTube Coffee Enemas.

20:13:49&nbsp;
Kristina
Hi Joseph. Welcome.

20:13:58&nbsp;
Kristina
Please feel free to chime in.

20:14:07&nbsp;
Joseph
thank you

20:14:28&nbsp;
Dave
I have seen the coffee enema YT footage, from one of your DVDs?

20:15:12&nbsp;
Kristina
Coffee enemas work because their is a circulatory system embedded in the sigmoid colon. When the coffee from the enema is within this area of the colon, this system carries the coffee directly to the liver.

20:15:24&nbsp;
Kristina
Yes, Dave.

20:15:40&nbsp;
Michael R
Kristina, would you say a coffee enema weekly or every other week would be good?

20:16:09&nbsp;
Kristina
The coffee enema footage is taken from our DVD, Cleansing, Coffee Enemas and Colon Tubes.

20:16:32&nbsp;
Dave
Michael R, maybe labor prep was when some women got their first enemas. Maybe ancient history now.

20:16:53&nbsp;
Kristina
How often one benefits from taking a coffee enema depends on the individual.

20:16:57&nbsp;
Kristina
Hi Lisa!

20:16:58&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Hi everyone! Sorry I'm late!

20:17:18&nbsp;
Dave
You're excused!

20:17:24&nbsp;
michael b
i saw the you tube videos, part 7and 8. they were great. it also cleared up some questions i have had. 

20:18:14&nbsp;
Kristina
One place to read more about how often you ought to take a coffee enema can be found on the page, HOW OFTEN SHOULD I TAKE COFFEE ENEMAS?

20:18:15&nbsp;
michael b
hi lisa, how is spring in texas?

20:18:37&nbsp;
Michael R
Thank you, Kristina

20:18:46&nbsp;
Kristina
The doctor you mention has cancer patients taking coffee enemas 1-3 times daily.

20:19:04&nbsp;
Joseph
I tried to log onto the daytime chat kris, couldn't get the java thing.  err message kept popping up

20:19:22&nbsp;
Kristina
I think a solid protocol for optimizing liver, gallbladder and bowel health is about one time per week for most people. 

20:20:02&nbsp;
Lisa P.
I have an interesting article to share with you about coconut oil and &quot;good fat.&quot;

20:20:22&nbsp;
Lisa P.
here is the link. http://www.coconutresearchcenter.org/article10065.htm

20:20:30&nbsp;
Kristina
However, this varies with factors such as exposure to toxins, gallbladder and bowel health, time, commitment, and the results of one's hair tissue mineral analysis.

20:20:51&nbsp;
Dave
Know a therapist who does coffee weekly, just for maintenance.

20:21:23&nbsp;
Michael R
Thank you, Kristina

20:21:49&nbsp;
Kristina
Great. Lisa. Yes, coconut oil is key to good health. I use it daily. We offer Spectrum coconut oil.

20:22:05&nbsp;
Kristina
I will have a look at the link you sent me after the chat.

20:22:26&nbsp;
Kristina
Can you share with us, Lisa, what you have been learning about coconut oil?

20:22:35&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Okay Kris. That's good you'll read it.

20:23:17&nbsp;
Kristina
but can you gives us a little synopsis so others can learn, Lisa?

20:23:24&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Not a while lot so far, but am learning from this article and from you of course.

20:24:12&nbsp;
Kristina
okay, here is the blurb from my website: Unrefined Organic Coconut Oil is considered by many to be the healthiest and most versatile dietary oil in the world. Once thought to be a &quot;bad&quot; fat, coconut oil has been proven to be a stable, healthy saturated fat that can help maintain proper cholesterol levels, support thyroid function, ease digestive disorder symptoms, avert hypoglycemia cravings and provide many other health benefits. Unrefined Organic Coconut Oil contains lauric acid, the kind found in mother's milk, along with other medium-chain fatty acids. These super fatty acids are quickly metabolized and converted to energy in the body, rather than being stored as fat.      * Helps maintain healthy HDL and LDL cholesterol ratios and support healthy thyroid function     * Contains antibacterial, antiviral and anti-fungal properties     * Abundant in medium-chain fatty acids     * Made from 100% certified organic coconuts  Unrefined Organic Coconut oil also makes an excellent enema lubricant. It is antibacterial, antiviral, and anti-fungal.

20:24:13&nbsp;
Lisa P.
I meant whole lot. Typo because I'm tired.

20:24:38&nbsp;
Vince
Kristina...what is the shelf life of enema soap packets?

20:24:40&nbsp;
Joseph
I love the coconut oil, I use it all the time

20:24:43&nbsp;
Kristina
we are all allowed LOTS of typos!

20:24:53&nbsp;
Joseph
and what is the shelf life of the jar of coconut oil?

20:25:37&nbsp;
Kristina
It can also be used as an enema lubricant and as a rectal implant. Just take one teaspoon to one tablespoon on the finger or enema nozzle and insert into the rectum.

20:25:57&nbsp;
Dave
As lubricant, do you mean for nozzle like KY, etc?

20:25:59&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Thanks Kris! My mind is still in Carmel! lol!

20:26:17&nbsp;
Kristina
Vince, do you mean the Castile Soap packets?

20:26:26&nbsp;
Vince
yes

20:27:22&nbsp;
Kristina
As long as the individual soap packets aren't opened the soap ought to last at least 3 years.

20:27:31&nbsp;
Vince
Thanks

20:27:55&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Castile soap is great for everything! I think it should last a long time. 

20:27:59&nbsp;
Kristina
Wow on meeting Doris Day and hanging out with her and playing your flute for her. That  must of been fabulous.

20:28:04&nbsp;
Joseph
what about the coconut oil kris?  I never refrigerate it...

20:28:23&nbsp;
Dave
Thanks for your answer before my question. Old former therapist used Vitamin E cream for both nozzle and anus, touting its health value for me.

20:28:43&nbsp;
Kristina
Soap has an expiration date on it because its compounds become altered in time (the oils and such) and in some cases become harmful

20:28:44&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Oh yes, playing for Doris Day. What a surprise when I got that gig!

20:29:17&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Doris Day uses enemas you know, but we didn't talk about that! I want to know her better.

20:29:41&nbsp;
Michael R
I never heard about her using enemas

20:30:18&nbsp;
michael b
K, how much coconut oil for you per day? i have seen frozen coconut bars dunked in dark chocolate. lisa,did you go to the aquarium in monterrey?

20:30:49&nbsp;
Dave
We know that Doris would highly endorse enema care, according to many reports of her own use.

20:31:09&nbsp;
Kristina
Coconut oil does not need to be kept in the refrigerator. In the Philippines and other tropical climates, where the temperature is much higher than North America, people traditionally have not refrigerated coconut oil. Coconut oil is very stable since it is unrefined and mostly saturated. The expiration dates on Coconut Oils are for two years but it will usually be fine much longer than the expiration dates. I do recommend you store the oil out of direct sunlight. 

20:31:21&nbsp;
Lisa P.
No, I didn't have time! Next time for sure.

20:31:46&nbsp;
Kristina
Use at least one tablespoon of coconut oil daily.

20:31:53&nbsp;
Kristina
More is great.

20:32:06&nbsp;
Joseph
thank you kris, I recently tossed my first jar I bought from you, I need another, it is the best lubricant ever

20:32:09&nbsp;
Vince
Better than fish oil??

20:32:40&nbsp;
Kristina
The benefits of coconut oil are mainly from the nutrient value of medium chain fatty acids (MCFAs). The best comparison in nature as to the percentage of MCFAs being consumed in a diet is human breast milk. To equal the amount of MCFAs a nursing infant would receive in one day, an adult would need to consume about 3.5 tablespoons of coconut oil a day according to researchers. Since coconut oil in nature is packaged inside the coconut meat, it is recommended to take this amount throughout the day with food high in fiber and protein. However, for those not used to coconut oil in their diet, it is best to start out with an amount far less than this first, to see how your body reacts.

20:32:45&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Is eating coconut just as good, or do we need the oil? I love coconut!

20:33:27&nbsp;
Kristina
There is more viscosity to coconut oil so it does work better as a lubricant than fish oil but do you mean is coconut oil healthier to ingest than fish oil?

20:33:36&nbsp;
Dave
Is there a lifespan for goat's milk soap?

20:33:42&nbsp;
Vince
yes

20:36:38&nbsp;
Michael R
This is really helpful, thank you Kristina

20:37:17&nbsp;
Kristina
Lauric acid, one of the two medium chain fatty acids isthe major fatty acid from the fat of the coconut and has long been recognized for the unique properties that it lends to nonfood uses in the soaps and cosmetics industry. More recently, lauric acid has been recognized for its unique dietary properties which are related to its antiviral, antibacterial, and antiprotozoal functions. Now, capric acid, another of coconut’s fatty acids has been added to the list of coconut’s antimicrobial components.

20:37:36&nbsp;
Kristina
Fish oil, on the other hand, is used therapuetically for completely different reasons.

20:37:46&nbsp;
Kristina
Fish oil is high is other types of fatty acids.

20:38:03&nbsp;
Kristina
For instance, DHA and EPA.

20:38:06&nbsp;
Vince
Again, thanks...good info

20:38:32&nbsp;
michael b
i have meant to ask,how much ground flax seed do you reccomend using per day?

20:39:42&nbsp;
Kristina
DHA and EPA are two Omega 3 fatty acids

20:40:19&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Everyone should read the link about the coconut oil. Good information also. Here is the link again. http://www.coconutresearchcenter.org/article10065.htm

20:40:19&nbsp;
Vince
Good discussion, but must depart.  Will read the log later.

20:40:39&nbsp;
Kristina
DHA provides cognitive support, support for eye health, and nerve health.

20:41:16&nbsp;
Joseph
I emailed it to myself, thank you Lisa :)

20:41:48&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Great! You're welcome Joseph.

20:43:11&nbsp;
Kristina
EPA is also for mood support and for support of the musculoskeletal system.

20:43:19&nbsp;
Kristina
Of course, they are both excellent for heart health.

20:43:42&nbsp;
Kristina
We are also offering OrthOmega Pearls for kids.

20:43:42&nbsp;
michael b
the bag of &quot;fortified flax&quot; the stuff you sell,says 2 tbls.twice a day,enough?

20:43:53&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Changing the subject Kris, do you believe taking an aspirin a day is good for your heart? I'm thinking of taking one asprin a day.

20:43:57&nbsp;
Kristina
Ground flax seed-1-3 T daily

20:44:17&nbsp;
Kristina
Aspirin....325mg? or a baby aspirin?

20:44:38&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Baby aspirin 81 mg.

20:44:52&nbsp;
Kristina
It depends who you talk to. 

20:45:23&nbsp;
Kristina
For sometime, I took a daily baby aspirin but I am currently following the guidance of people who don't agree that aspirin is therapuetic.

20:45:34&nbsp;
Kristina
One reason we take aspirin is to reduce inflammation in the body.

20:46:14&nbsp;
Kristina
This is good but there are better ways to do this like taking daily fish oil.

20:46:54&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Thanks Kris for your answer.

20:47:07&nbsp;
Kristina
Daily aspirin therapy does lower the risk of heart attack and stroke in some people.

20:47:23&nbsp;
Michael R
I have been wondering the same thing, thank you

20:47:26&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Is your Mom taking aspirin?

20:47:29&nbsp;
Kristina
Mayo clinic states, You should consider daily aspirin therapy only if you've had a heart attack or stroke, or you're at high risk of either.

20:47:52&nbsp;
Kristina
Aspirin interferes with your blood's clotting action

20:47:53&nbsp;
Dave
On doc's recommendation for cardio, Lisa, I take one 81mg baby aspirin a day. of course, aspirin now not recommended for babies, lol. Can also cause stomach bleeding in sensitive people.

20:48:09&nbsp;
Michael R
are there risks to daily aspirin?

20:48:16&nbsp;
Kristina
this clotting can also happen within the vessels that supply your heart and brain with blood. If your blood vessels are already narrowed from atherosclerosis — the accumulation of fatty deposits in your arteries — a blood clot can quickly form and block the artery. This prevents blood flow to the heart or brain and causes a heart attack or stroke. Aspirin therapy reduces the clumping action of platelets — possibly preventing heart attack and stroke.

20:49:25&nbsp;
Kristina
Some conditions that may prevent you from starting daily aspirin therapy include:    A bleeding or clotting disorder (bleeding easily)   Asthma,   Stomach ulcers,   Heart failure. Taking aspirin and ibuprofen together reduces the beneficial effects of the aspirin. Taking aspirin with other anticoagulants, such as warfarin (Coumadin) could greatly increase your chance of bleeding. 

20:50:17&nbsp;
michael b
is it a blood thinner? i have heard if you think you are having a heart attack, take aspirin right away.

20:50:33&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Just wondering about your Mom. Is she taking aspirin? How is she doing now?

20:51:09&nbsp;
Kristina
Regular aspirin can also hurt the kidneys

20:51:27&nbsp;
Michael R
what dose of aspirin for heart attacks?

20:51:38&nbsp;
Kristina
no

20:52:44&nbsp;
Lisa P.
325mg for heart attacks I heard from Dr. Oz on Oprah.

20:53:40&nbsp;
Kristina
You will get all different opinions on how much aspirin to take. Somewhere between 81-325mgs is recommended usually.

20:53:57&nbsp;
Kristina
Also, if you are gluten sensitive, you are likely to react to the starch in aspirin.

20:54:12&nbsp;
Kristina
This is one of the many reasons that I stopped using a daily aspirin

20:55:11&nbsp;
michael b
that is just one tablet. i would think it would be more. i'm glad this came up.

20:55:15&nbsp;
Lisa P.
I'm learning a lot today. Thank you.

20:55:54&nbsp;
Dave
Day chat this month?

20:56:15&nbsp;
Kristina
A few statistics:

20:56:25&nbsp;
Kristina
About 15% of the people on dialysis today are there as a result of the damage that aspirin did to their kidneys

20:56:49&nbsp;
Kristina
Aspirin may also be associated with diverticular disease of the colon.

20:56:54&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Dave, &quot;Day&quot; as in Doris? Sorry, bad one!!

20:57:49&nbsp;
Dave
Well, we could discuss her for an hour LOL.

20:57:53&nbsp;
Kristina
There are also many recorded deaths from bleeding ulcers and aspirin use.

20:57:59&nbsp;
Kristina
regular aspirin use that is.

20:58:20&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Sounds pretty scary Kristina!

20:58:27&nbsp;
Kristina
Glucosamine 500 mg three times a day works quite nicely for most degenerative arthritis and an herb from India called Boswellia serratia works for inflammatory arthritis like rheumatoid arthritis. We do offer these products off line if anyone is interested.

20:59:43&nbsp;
Kristina
Yes, daytime chat, which as I said earlier was very well attended, will be on Wednesday, April 22nd. It is always at noon on the 4th Wednesday of the month.

20:59:44&nbsp;
Joseph
I'm interested kristina

21:00:00&nbsp;
Joseph
wow, yea, well I tried to make it!

21:00:05&nbsp;
Kristina
Thank you everyone for attending. It is always such a blessing to have your company. I will talk to you soon.

21:00:07&nbsp;
Kristina
Bye now.
