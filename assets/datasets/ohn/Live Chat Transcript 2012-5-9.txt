Hey, DeeDee. Randy here. Am I early?

13:00:32
randyu
I have a question about general cleansing. Should I keep to a regular schedule even if I am feeling OK?

13:00:39
deedee
Hi, Randy and Bob.

13:00:44
randyu
Hi.

13:01:30
Carl
Hello.

13:01:47
deedee
Welcome, Carl . 

13:01:52
Bob L.
Hello, DeeDee and Randy... and Carl.

13:02:16
deedee
Randy, you can keep a regular schedule that feels good to you.

13:02:32
Bob L.
Just completed my weekly 2 1/2 hour therapeutic massage and coffee enema...

13:02:47
Bob L.
Talk about relaxed!

13:03:35
deedee
That sounds great, Bob.

13:04:03
Bob L.
As soon as therapist left, went right to bed and asleep until now.

13:04:15
randyu
Bob, are you sleepy relaxed or just relaxed?

13:04:20
Bob L.
My abdomen feels so flat.

13:04:32
Bob L.
I am sleepy relaxed!

13:04:43
deedee
How wonderful. How often do you have that done?

13:05:00
randyu
The coffee enema/massage must have a profound effect on you, Bob!

13:05:06
Bob L.
Every Tuesday or Wednesday at 7:30 am... therapist comes here.  She is great.

13:05:20
Bob L.
They always do, Randy.

13:05:49
Bob L.
You asked me last week if invigorating... Yes, they are.

13:05:57
randyu
Bob, you are lucky to have someone who can give you this treatment.  It is so much more relaxing when you don't have to do it by yourself.

13:06:06
Bob L.
For sure.

13:06:41
deedee
Yes, how true.  It is too bad there are not more people out there willing to do these therapeutic treatments.

13:06:54
Bob L.
She is an experienced LPN... a bit older... to match my age of 79... so she is a nurse from the enema era...

13:07:26
Bob L.
Lots of experience...

13:07:37
Bob L.
and she has a powerful energy field as do I.

13:07:40
deedee
We are revamping our website to make it more user-friendly and to have as much information we can have on it without making it confusing to you all.  Does anyone have any suggestions?

13:07:53
deedee
Welcome, Howard.

13:07:56
randyu
Yes, enema therapy is making a comeback; it was a big part of healthcare back in my childhood days, 60s, 70s.

13:08:15
howard
The weather is really wet.

13:08:30
Bob L.
It sure was... Enemas were frequent for me as a child... My earliest recollection in life was being given an enema in a doctor's office.

13:08:45
deedee
We will be shooting some more videos on cleaning equipment, putting equipment together, how to use oils therapeutically, etc.  Any other suggestions?

13:08:49
Bob L.
I believe that had a lasting impact on me.

13:09:21
randyu
Yes, MDs and nurses used them for the whole family to treat and prevent illnesses.  They worked!

13:09:43
Bob L.
I did a study in a web group a few years ago and enemas related to one's personality.

13:10:10
deedee
What did the study say, Bob?

13:10:51
Bob L.
The members of the group scored very high... consistently... You know we are a bit on the compulsive side and perfectionists.

13:11:12
randyu
For the website:  Video samples about cleansing with a link to buying the right equipment for your needs.

13:11:45
deedee
Linking from the video to the products is a great idea, Randy!

13:11:59
deedee
Hi again, Howard! 

13:12:00
Bob L.
I would bet that almost all of you you here 

13:12:30
Bob L.
fall into that group.

13:12:33
randyu
Yes, DeeDee, the videos are great!  But you need to get all the right stuff like Celtic sea salts, etc., to match.

13:13:25
randyu
That is also covered in Kristina's book, but that should be briefly on the website links...

13:14:17
deedee
Right, we are trying to make the products you need easier to find and making recommendations, etc.

13:15:34
deedee
We will be expanding on the use of the essential oils in enemas, etc., in the videos too, for those that are interested in that.

13:15:43
randyu
Do you have a webmaster doing this for you?  Start there and refocus.

13:16:17
randyu
Coffee enema demo linked to materials needed...

13:16:33
Bob L.
I'd still recommend a bit more notice of the chats... Almost missed this one again.

13:17:05
randyu
Ditto here, too Bob.

13:17:21
deedee
Yes, we do have a webmaster, but we are also giving a lot of input.  My input is mostly on the customers/clients and what they've asked over the years.

13:17:52
deedee
Kristina only puts out notice the day before, but I can ask her to do that  a couple of days ahead.

13:18:03
Bob L.
Thank you much.

13:18:14
randyu
DeeDee, does OHN network or partner with any other like places in other areas?  Wisconsin is far from the east coast.

13:18:53
randyu
That would help...

13:19:00
randyu
A link to partners in other areas would help...

13:19:37
Bob L.
I'd like to see a way on the website that individuals with particular interests could contact one another by email.  I know you don't want that capability here in the chat.

13:20:25
howard
How long do you get results for the arthritis enema cure sesame oil? I have had bad luck with any of herbs and the injection of cortizone except for a week.

13:20:34
randyu
Right on, Bob... I like that idea... That way we can share info as we feel comfortable to do.

13:20:57
Bob L.
Yes.

13:21:44
randyu
Perhaps a chat room just for the users here, who can then share email if they choose to.  It would be support and help network.

13:22:12
randyu
:) 

13:22:35
Bob L.
I mentioned last week that I developed a way to release the coffee enema while remaining on the massage table.  I'd like to share that on an individual basis, but not appropriate here, I don't feel.

13:22:49
deedee
Sorry about being gone for a few minutes. I had to take care of a client for a couple of minutes.  

13:23:27
randyu
Also, DeeDee and Bob, this extra chat for users would take the workload off of you and Kristina, leaving more time for shop.

13:24:07
howard
Does Lipitor cause all of the side effects such a neuropathy?

13:24:12
deedee
We do not partner with anyone.  In general, colon therapists are taught not to give enemas. We are unique in that way, but we are teaching the people who are more interested in that. I have had a few therapists come here to learn the technique.

13:24:32
deedee
Welcome, Bill.

13:25:10
randyu
DeeDee, why are therapists taught not to give enemas?

13:25:23
deedee
We used to have a chat room, etc., like that, but it got out of hand and attracted the wrong people.  We want it to be health-related only and it is hard to monitor and control those issues.

13:25:47
Bob L.
Understand that, DeeDee. 

13:26:23
Bill D
Hi all. First time on chat. Just moved to SE Louisiana and &quot;You wouldn't believe how soft the water is!&quot; Yes, the enemas are very refreshing!

13:26:24
randyu
Yes, I can see the control issue.

13:26:56
Bob L.
Just the opportunity to exchange email addresses would suffice, I feel.

13:27:15
deedee
The international association for colon hydrotherpists believes that enemas do not do the thorough job that colonics do and also think they may be addictive.  We know differently and are working on getting past that with them.

13:27:41
deedee
I think also they feel that the profession would be compromised, etc.

13:28:06
Bob L.
Precisely, DeeDee.

13:29:06
Bob L.
By the way, I once went to the London colonic treatment center that Lady Di frequented on a weekly basis.

13:29:10
Carl
I go to a colon therapist in Florida who gives me a coffee enema after a colonic, but she doesn't want anyone else to know that she does.

13:29:21
deedee
I think the way people know of or think of enemas these days are like the Fleet enemas in the drug store.  They do not understand the therapeutic level that enemas can reach because they only see that type of emergency equipment.

13:29:43
deedee
That is very interesting, Bob.  You are worldly!

13:30:03
deedee
Carl, I think that is the case many times.

13:30:08
Bob L.
I was in the military 30 years and have had enemas, colonics, and massages all over the world.

13:30:19
deedee
Welcome, Emmett.

13:30:47
Emmett
Hi, DeeDee. 

13:30:47
deedee
Bob, are enemas common in other countries?

13:30:52
Bob L.
Austria and Switzerland the best.

13:30:54
Bill D
Too bad about I-ACT. Their loss is our gain, taking over the world one enema at a time!

13:30:56
randyu
Bob D, you use tap water in Louisiana for enemas?

13:30:59
Bob L.
Very much so in Europe.

13:31:17
Bob L.
I use tap water all the time.

13:31:50
randyu
I also use tap water. It is OK in my area, near mountains... like spring water.

13:32:09
deedee
Does your tap water contain chlorine or fluoride?

13:32:11
Carl
She is afraid that she will be in trouble with the Florida regulators if they found out, but you don't seem to have that problem in Wisconsin.

13:32:44
deedee
Florida is definitely more regulated.  Hopefully that won't happen in Wisconsin.

13:32:46
randyu
Some chlorine in my tap water...

13:32:52
Bob L.
Florida has colonic specialists everywhere... Lived there three times.

13:33:14
Bill D
Hi, Randy. Yes, the water is very &quot;soft&quot;just the way it is!

13:33:36
deedee
If you do not have access to good water or spring water, you should get some, or use a filter.

13:34:11
randyu
Some MDs in Florida still use tap water enemas in the office, mostly primary care doctors.  I assume the water is filtered.

13:34:20
deedee
Yes, certain areas do seem to have more colon therapists, like California also.

13:34:28
Carl
I use a Zero Water filter system for my enemas.

13:34:45
deedee
Carl, does that one work well?

13:35:13
Bill D
In CA there seems to be one on every corner!

13:35:18
Bob L.
I had one Chinese therapist in Florida who gave enemas and acupuncture simultaneously... now THAT is relaxation!

13:35:26
Carl
Yes, I like it a lot. A filter lasts 2 or 3 weeks.

13:35:49
randyu
Acupuncture and enemas?  Never heard of that one.

13:35:53
deedee
Bob, you could be a navigation system for finding colonics and enema places!

13:35:55
Bob L.
Nor had I. 

13:36:13
Bob L.
Well, in thirty years, guess so.

13:36:31
randyu
What is the purpose of enemas with acupuncture?

13:36:36
deedee
Hi Carrie and Leo. I missed your entrance!

13:37:01
Bob L.
I'll have to pass on answering that one, Randy.

13:37:03
randyu
Hi Carrie and Leo.

13:37:31
Leo C
Thanks,  just trying to learn...

13:37:52
deedee
I would suppose, because both treatments open the body up for healing and detoxing, that they may work well together.  Lymphatic massage and colonics work well one after the other, and throw in a FIR sauna like we do here also.  It is a great healing pack.

13:38:25
randyu
Relaxation is my guess, too.

13:38:29
Bob L.
Yes, the combo sound wonderful.

13:38:54
Carrie J
Hi all. Hard to find colonics in IA.

13:39:27
deedee
It is a funny thing that most people who talk about enemas say they are relaxing, but not so much with colonics - most people do not refer to colonics that way.

13:39:32
Bob L.
The entire Midwest... ultraconservative.

13:40:01
Leo C
Same.

13:40:02
deedee
Carrie, I do not think there are any colon therapists in IA.  All of the clients come here!

13:40:33
Bob L.
Wow, I have never found it that way, DeeDee.

13:40:44
deedee
Yes, Madison is unique, so we are lucky to be here and have great clientele.

13:40:47
howard
How do they do colonics?

13:41:05
randyu
I would say enemas would be better than colonics as long as they do the same job.

13:41:20
Bob L.
You can always buy a colonic board, Carrie.

13:41:28
Leo C
Can enemas really do the same job?

13:42:03
Bob L.
I'll tell you something about colonics... I found that as I aged, colonics were too much for me... I had to give it up.

13:42:06
randyu
Yes, enemas, if done right and high enough, can clean out the entire colon.

13:42:21
deedee
Enemas done therapeutically -- the way we do them here and the way we teach people to do them at home -- are  unique and very cleansing.  If done like this, they do as great of a job as the colonics do.

13:42:31
Bob L.
The enema no problem at all... but have had to restrict quantity.

13:42:51
randyu
Why, Bob, did you have to give it up?  Too much stress on the system?

13:43:22
Bob L.
Yes, it weakened me too much... but suppose my lymphocytic leukemia was starting to develop.

13:43:26
deedee
Colonics can be a little more intense, but I feel that I do them as relaxing as possible.

13:43:43
Carrie J
Rock Island is my closest.  Will consider Madison if I can learn methods for at home.

13:44:03
Bill D
Thanks for the info, DeeDee! I agree! 

13:44:11
deedee
That would be great, Carrie.  Do you currently have equipment or a colon board?

13:44:23
randyu
What are you looking to accomplish, Carrie?

13:44:57
Bob L.
I found an excellent colon board in Sandy, Utah.  

13:45:01
Leo C
Do you have quite a waiting list for treatments, DeeDee?

13:45:44
Bob L.
I had to give up the colon board use also... just too much, with that 5-gallon bucket.

13:46:21
Carrie J
Enema equipment, but no board...? Storage and mess... Removal of built-up toxins is goal.

13:46:21
deedee
Leo, it is our busier time now.  I am booking the last week of May and into June.

13:46:25
Bill D
Hi, DeeDee, only had a few colonics from two therapists in southern Cal and all were very relaxing and pleasant!

13:47:27
Leo C
Do you have regular equipment sales or are they rather rare?

13:47:43
deedee
That is great, Bill.  If you go into it thinking of it as a great experience, it will be.  Many people are very nervous and very sensitive at first.

13:47:51
Emmett
Seems like it would be hard to keep 5 gallons of water warm.

13:48:07
Bob L.
No, it runs in and out simultaneously.

13:48:31
Bob L.
Oh, I see... You mean keeping water warm... No issue.

13:48:48
deedee
We have monthly sales.  The sale code is emailed to you in our monthly newsletter.  Sign up for the newsletter on our website.  The sales are usually  the last 5 days of every month.

13:49:24
Bill D
Thanks, DeeDee! That was several years ago but both ladies are still very close friends although we live states apart!

13:49:54
deedee
Yes, isn't that great that we can develop friendships over colonics and enemas?

13:50:00
Leo C
Thanks, DeeDee. I'll have to check your site out more.

13:50:09
howard
I use the sales every time.

13:50:40
randyu
Kristina's book is great!  I think it is worth the time spent for sure...

13:50:41
deedee
Thanks, Leo.  Let me know if you have any recommendations about the site.  We are working on updating it.

13:51:25
Emmett
Will there be a Mother's Day sale?

13:51:46
Leo C
Does glycerin or soap have a place in an initial enema?

13:52:27
randyu
Gotta run, all. Thanks!  Catch you next time! Bye. 

13:52:34
Bob L.
I used to use Dr. Bronner's castile peppermint soap, but found the peppermint too stringent.

13:52:35
Carrie J
I've been meaning to get the book and videos for 3 months. Need guide for easier short enema.

13:52:59
howard
I would highly recommend  Kristina's book, Ten Days to Optimal Health. 

13:53:14
Leo C
Want the first one to be effective but irritation can be an issue.

13:53:21
deedee
Emmet, no Mother's Day sale :(

13:53:27
deedee
Thanks, Randy.

13:53:54
deedee
Bob, what have you found that you like better?

13:54:19
Bob L.
I just add some plain ol' soft soap along with the coffee.

13:54:37
Bob L.
I'm not much on other than the old time basics.

13:54:42
Leo C
Is ivory bar bad?

13:55:16
deedee
Carrie, you may like one of our download videos.  The small volume one is for limited time and the large volume enema is the more therapeutic and more effective one.

13:55:27
Bob L.
Being 79, I was raised on the old methods... which harmed no one.

13:56:16
deedee
Ivory just may contain an unatural scent in it.

13:56:24
Emmett
 Try Olivella from QVC. Very gentle on the bottom.

13:56:58
Bill D
I like the Dr. Bronner's but I only use a few drops per 2 quarts! Not teaspoons full!  Just a few drops give the water a soothing, relaxing scent and feeling.

13:57:28
Carrie J
Thanks, DeeDee. I think they'll be my Mother's Day gift ;)

13:57:34
deedee
Good tip, Bill.  

13:57:42
deedee
That is a great gift, Carrie!

13:58:08
Bill D
Thanks, DeeDee!

13:58:22
deedee
Hi, Victoria. You are an hour late.

13:58:58
deedee
Sorry about that, Victoria!

13:59:36
Bill D
About time to say bye to all. Been a great chat. Take care, all!

14:00:00
Bob L.
Thanks, DeeDee... Good discussion.

14:00:08
Leo C
Bye and thanks.

14:00:42
Carl
Thanks, DeeDee. Bye.

14:01:07
Carrie J
Thanks for info. Bye.

14:01:36
deedee
Thank you all.  See you next time!
