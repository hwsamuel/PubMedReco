Hello. Please feel free to start your posts. I will also begin a few threads. I am very pleased to see all of you here tonight. Welcome, welcome, welcome!

19:59:47&nbsp;
lembree
I have a product question concerning the 7' higginson system that I purchased

20:00:12&nbsp;
kristina
One of the topics that I would like to address tonight is enema effectiveness and improving the muscular strength of the colon

20:00:49&nbsp;
lembree
you show a new set of one way valves that are much larger than the ones that came with my system. do those flow faster from a bag without squeezing the bulb?

20:01:28&nbsp;
kristina
Good questions.

20:01:40&nbsp;
Joseph
I would like to try a high enema, I have never had one.  Can you recommend a good starter kit?

20:03:04&nbsp;
kristina
the valves do not allow for more flow when not squeezing the bulb.

20:03:40&nbsp;
kristina
The reason you would want to change out the valves is because they allow for a greater flow once the bulb is squeezed.

20:04:07&nbsp;
lembree
i like that answer Kris. thank you

20:04:12&nbsp;
kristina
Joseph, Most of our enema kits will work for a high enema.

20:04:52&nbsp;
kristina
However, in order to clear out the entire colon, which is what you are working to do in a high enema, you will usually want an enema bag that holds 4 quarts of water. 

20:05:32&nbsp;
Cathy V
I'm looking forward to hearing about how to improve muscular strength of colon

20:06:05&nbsp;
kristina
Our best enema kits that hold 4 quarts of water are our 4 quart Flowmaster Complete Colon Cleanse Enema Kits However, our 4 Quart Easy Enema Kits are also excellent choices.

20:06:29&nbsp;
Dave
Effectiveness of enemas also an interest. Could learn from that. 

20:07:06&nbsp;
kristina
If anyone here uses any of these kits, please do feel free to comment.

20:07:30&nbsp;
Joseph
thank you!

20:07:31&nbsp;
lembree
I have the 4 qt black Klystra bag, and i love it.

20:07:48&nbsp;
lembree
wish i could afford the silicone one, but can't at the moment

20:08:01&nbsp;
kristina
The Flowmasters come with the DVD, Cleansing, Coffee Enemas and Colon Tubes, which is very useful in taking a high enema.</a>

20:08:27&nbsp;
kristina
Our downloadable short, Large Volume Enemas, is also very useful

20:08:34&nbsp;
kristina
for learning how to take high enemas.

20:08:49&nbsp;
Lisa P.
I have the 4 quart black bag that came with the bulb. I like it a lot for a really good cleaning. I bought it from OHN four years ago.

20:09:02&nbsp;
kristina
The trick is taking the water into the colon VERY slowly and taking 2-4 quarts of water, 1-3 times. This is called an enema series.

20:09:23&nbsp;
Joseph
excellent thank you

20:09:47&nbsp;
kristina
They are referring to  4 Quart Flowmaster Complete Colon Cleansing Enema Kit

20:09:52&nbsp;
kristina
4 quart Flowmaster Complete Colon Cleanse Enema Kits

20:10:30&nbsp;
jps
I have used the four quart Olympic bag with a colon tube and find it very effective 

20:10:44&nbsp;
kristina
Okay, a bit of biochemistry: All higher lifeforms require a subtle and complex electrolyte balance between the intracellular and extracellular milieu. In particular, the maintenance of precise osmotic gradients of electrolytes is important. Such gradients affect and regulate the hydration of the body, blood pH, and are critical for nerve and muscle function. 

20:11:16&nbsp;
michael b
a most wonderful fall to all at this live chat.

20:11:58&nbsp;
Lisa P.
I buy only good rubber bags, because I use oil often.

20:12:21&nbsp;
lembree
why not use a silicone bag, oil won't bother that

20:12:26&nbsp;
Dave
Re slowness, I think speed is too ingrained and must be overcome.

20:12:27&nbsp;
kristina
When we take enemas, we ideally want to effect our own internal electrolyte balance so that by taking enemas we are not only partaking of a colon cleanse but we are also optimizing the electrolyte balance within our colon in order to improve our colonic muscular function.

20:12:50&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Silicone bags are way too expensive for me.

20:13:18&nbsp;
lembree
i agree, lisa, but one would last a lot longer than buying 10 rubber bags.

20:13:58&nbsp;
Cathy V
so how do we affect electrolyte balance of colon? guess-sea salt?

20:13:59&nbsp;
kristina
I do hope to source a less expensive silicone enema bag. I haven't decided whether the bag would be a 3 quart or 2 quart enema bag. Please do give me your input. And, if anyone is aware of manufacturers of silicone products, do send the information my way.

20:14:11&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, sea salt.

20:14:30&nbsp;
Lisa P.
True. I don't use credit cards anymore, so I need to have the cash in hand to buy it. Someday I'll buy one.

20:14:42&nbsp;
kristina
The elemental make-up of the sea salt ought to be:

20:14:56&nbsp;
Cathy V
Wow. Tell me more please about using sea salt

20:15:05&nbsp;
Dave
Pleased with the OHN silicone colon tubing.

20:15:12&nbsp;
lembree
Kris... why do i need to urinate so often after a soapsuds enema if i forget to add table or sea salt to the solution?

20:15:21&nbsp;
kristina
Calcium- 0.250000%

20:15:33&nbsp;
kristina
Magnesium - 0.360000%

20:15:43&nbsp;
Lisa P.
I do have the silcone colon tube, and like it!

20:15:50&nbsp;
kristina
ph  (10% solution) - 10.23

20:16:00&nbsp;
kristina
Potassium - 0.090000%

20:16:09&nbsp;
kristina
Sodium - 35.260000%

20:16:25&nbsp;
lembree
is that because of electrolyte imbalance?

20:16:27&nbsp;
kristina
That is a perfect example. 

20:17:01&nbsp;
Billy the Kid
Hello everybody

20:17:08&nbsp;
Dave
welcome Billy, long time no talk.

20:17:50&nbsp;
kristina
For some people who have a significant electrolyte imbalance in the colon, you will find that urinary frequency will increase without the proper electrolyte balance between the intracellular and extracellular milieu in the colon.

20:18:57&nbsp;
kristina
By using a sea salt, with these levels of minerals in your regular enema series, most people will find that they have a more successful colon cleanse and they will have increased muscular function of the colon. 

20:19:36&nbsp;
Dave
That's why colon therapists always seem to advise the bathroom before a session.

20:19:39&nbsp;
kristina
Muscle contraction is dependent upon the presence of calcium (Ca2+), sodium (Na+), and potassium (K+). Without sufficient levels of these key electrolytes, muscle weakness or severe muscle contractions may occur.

20:19:55&nbsp;
Lisa P.
I never take an enema without sea salt.

20:20:21&nbsp;
kristina
These are also the reasons why, if you are taking regular enemas, you will want to also have regular Hair Analysis

20:20:48&nbsp;
Cathy V
what ratio of salt to water and is salt used with other solutions?

20:20:50&nbsp;
kristina
For those of you here who use the sea salt, how much do you use in each of your enemas?

20:21:10&nbsp;
Cathy V
ha

20:21:17&nbsp;
kristina
How much salt is needed depends on the brand of salt and on the individual person.

20:21:39&nbsp;
Joseph
I put a  teaspoon or tablespoon in 2.5 quarts

20:21:44&nbsp;
michael b
Kristina, do you advise adding sea salt to coffee solutions?

20:21:55&nbsp;
Lisa P.
I use one  teaspoon for each quart of water.

20:21:56&nbsp;
Joseph
I use your celtic sea salt kris

20:21:59&nbsp;
lembree
i generally use 4 t of table salt to 4 qts of water

20:21:59&nbsp;
kristina
If you are using Celtic sea salt, you start with 1 teaspoon per quart of water

20:22:08&nbsp;
Billy the Kid
I use 2 teaspoons per qt

20:22:30&nbsp;
kristina
If your individual mineral levels happen to be low, then you would need more salt.

20:22:39&nbsp;
jps
I use a half tea spoon of sea salt in a two quart enema.  

20:22:42&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Celtic sea salt is what I always use.

20:22:47&nbsp;
kristina
some people do better with a bit less salt.

20:23:13&nbsp;
lembree
is  it okay to use iodized salt?

20:23:28&nbsp;
Dave
How about folks with blood pressure issues and salt?

20:23:44&nbsp;
kristina
I want to draw your attention to a new page on our website. It is a HAIR ANALYSIS RATIO WORKSHEET

20:23:56&nbsp;
Billy the Kid
I was mistaken. I use 1 teaspoon per qt.

20:24:21&nbsp;
kristina
Have I missed any questions or comments?

20:24:35&nbsp;
kristina
Another subject worth discussing tonight is the Flu shot.

20:24:45&nbsp;
lembree
iodized salt ok?

20:25:06&nbsp;
lembree
I got a flu shot today. been diabetic for nearly 50 years.

20:25:26&nbsp;
Dave
On blood pressure/salt

20:25:46&nbsp;
Billy the Kid
I have gotten the shot every year since Lincoln was shot. No problems

20:25:47&nbsp;
lembree
did kristina get mad??? :)

20:25:57&nbsp;
Lisa P.
I never in my adult life had a flu shot, and I never had the flu! Other things I had, but not anything a flu shot would help.

20:26:17&nbsp;
lembree
welcome back...

20:26:24&nbsp;
kristina
Oops. I logged out accidentally, so if I missed anything in this last minute, let me know.

Live chat logs are now posted online

20:27:10&nbsp;
michael b
has the anti-freeze been taken out of flu shots?

20:27:20&nbsp;
lembree
I asked if using iodized salt was a problem?

20:27:34&nbsp;
Cathy V
I don't want flu shot. I take immune boosting supplements before and after being around exposures. Have done well that way.

20:28:01&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Good Cathy V!!!

20:28:24&nbsp;
Dave
Also, use of salt with blood pressure issues.

20:28:41&nbsp;
lembree
with a disease like diabetes, one should have a flu shot yearly, and I do, and I don't get the flu either. I think that enemas help to keep the flu away.

20:28:47&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, there is still Ethylene Glycol: Ethylene Glycol is nothing more than the technical name for anti-freeze, the same stuff that you put inside your car engine.

20:29:24&nbsp;
Cathy V
what about mercury in flu shot?

20:29:29&nbsp;
kristina
Again, it is best to use a salt with a full spectrum of minerals and at the levels that I have addressed earlier. 

20:29:40&nbsp;
Lisa P.
I heard that anti freeze is used in Dr.Pepper! Gross!

20:29:49&nbsp;
lembree
thanks about the salt.

20:30:09&nbsp;
Joseph
hi mary

20:30:18&nbsp;
Dave
Re flu season, weren't and maybe now, enemas more frequent?

20:30:25&nbsp;
Mary A
Hi all, my first time in

20:30:47&nbsp;
michael b
is this the same lisa from AUSTIN? 

20:30:57&nbsp;
Cathy V
Hey Mary, my first time in this chat too

20:30:59&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Welcome Mary A! Nice to have you with us!

20:31:17&nbsp;
kristina
Thimerosal: This is a mercury derived disinfectant and preservative which is used in the flu shots

20:31:27&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Nice to have you with us too Cathy V!! 

20:31:29&nbsp;
Mary A
Just wanted to thank Kristina and group for all the good advice

20:31:40&nbsp;
kristina
Welcome, Mary!

20:31:46&nbsp;
lembree
I think that we all worry too much about things in general. I'm 70 years old. When I was in elementary school we always had science and used real live mercury to polish coins with. Now, we need to call the hazardous substance people if we break a mercury 

20:31:54&nbsp;
lembree
thermometer. give me a break

20:31:59&nbsp;
kristina
Thank you

20:32:31&nbsp;
kristina
Well, I have dug up some research for people to ponder regarding flu shots:

20:32:39&nbsp;
kristina
? A recent study published in the October 2008 issue of the Archives of Pediatric &amp; Adolescent Medicine found that vaccinating young children against the flu had no impact on flu-related hospitalizations or doctor visits during two recent flu seasons. The researchers concluded that significant influenza vaccine effectiveness could not be demonstrated for any season, age, or setting examined.

20:32:50&nbsp;
kristina
? A study published in the Lancet just two months ago found that influenza vaccination was NOT associated with a reduced risk of pneumonia in older people. Vaccination coverage among the elderly increased from 15 percent in 1980 to 65 percent now, yet there has been no decrease in deaths from influenza or pneumonia.

20:33:09&nbsp;
kristina
? Research published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine last month also confirms that there has been no decrease in deaths from influenza and pneumonia, despite the fact that vaccination coverage among the elderly has increased from 15 percent in 1980 to 65 percent now.

20:33:35&nbsp;
kristina
? A large-scale, systematic review of 51 studies, published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews in 2006, found no evidence that the flu vaccine is any more effective than a placebo in children. The studies involved 260,000 children, age 6 to 23 months. 

20:34:31&nbsp;
lembree
good information, thank you, Kristina.

20:34:45&nbsp;
Cathy V
Yep

20:34:57&nbsp;
kristina
What is very exciting about all of this is that there is now evidence that epidemic influenza, and even some of the viruses that cause the common cold, may be prevented by adequate doses of vitamin D. 

20:35:09&nbsp;
Lisa P.
I also thank you Kristina. This is useful information!

20:35:11&nbsp;
kristina
the flu and cold season is indistinguishable from the vitamin D deficiency season.

20:35:15&nbsp;
Mary A
I had Guillian Barre some years ago and checked with my neurologist to see if he still advised advised.  MA he said, I don't even take a flu shot

20:35:43&nbsp;
210bob
So, who's pushing the flu shot program

20:35:44&nbsp;
Billy the Kid
My doctor gives me  a separate pneumonia shot every 5 years.

20:35:53&nbsp;
kristina
How do you know if you are Vitamin D deficient? Go to your doctor and have a simple test. 

20:36:05&nbsp;
kristina
You will need a 25-hydroxyvitamin D test, also called a 25(OH)D. Levels should be above 50 ng/ml year-round, in both children and adults

20:36:46&nbsp;
lembree
As i mentioned earlier, i do get the flu shot and have, like BtK, the pneumonia shot every 5 years.

20:37:23&nbsp;
kristina
Your body's innate immunity, especially the production of innate natural antibiotics called antimicrobial peptides, goes up and down every year with your vitamin D levels.

20:37:43&nbsp;
Cathy V
is it safe to assume that some sunshine everyday or most days is sufficient?

20:37:57&nbsp;
lembree
i do use 2 caltrate every day with 600 D in them

20:38:38&nbsp;
lembree
i don't know if that is enough or not. or how that compares with your statement above as to amount.

20:38:49&nbsp;
kristina
If you aren't taking a vitamin D supplement now. I would recommend it as one of your primary supplements. Take 10, 000 IU of Vitamin D (as cholecalciferol) until you get tested and then adjust from there.

20:39:14&nbsp;
kristina
Here is one vitamin D source: Bio-D-Mulsion Forte

20:40:33&nbsp;
Cathy V
Is daily sunshine on skin sufficient?????

20:40:35&nbsp;
kristina
The Caltrate is not likely to be enough vitamin D

20:40:54&nbsp;
kristina
It can be, depending on the individual. Indeed sunshine is one of the best sources of vitamin D.

20:41:24&nbsp;
kristina
The vitamin D formed when your skin is exposed to sunlight regulates the expression of more than 2,000 genes throughout your body, including ones that influence your immune system to attack and destroy bacteria and viruses

20:41:27&nbsp;
Billy the Kid
Would some kind of testosterone therapy help old people fight off some of the symptoms of aging?

20:41:41&nbsp;
lembree
ok, thanks, Kristina. Sorry, I'll have to catch up from the log. have to leave. Thanks for a very informative chat. good night all

20:42:03&nbsp;
kristina
It is important to have optimal hormone levels to age the most gracefully.

20:42:11&nbsp;
kristina
Except taking hormones is tricky business.

20:42:15&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Living in Texas, I get plenty of sunshine almost all year. Like John Denver said, &quot;Sunshine On My Shoulders Makes Us Happy.&quot; And healthy!

20:42:18&nbsp;
kristina
Hormones are not supplements.

20:43:09&nbsp;
kristina
When thinking hormones or thinking about taking hormones, you need to realize that in your body hormones function at very minute levels.

20:44:20&nbsp;
Cathy V
do you mean tiny amounts have an effect?????

20:44:25&nbsp;
kristina
A good analogy would be that an optimal level of testosterone in your body could be equivalent to a pinch of salt on a train full of potato chips.

20:44:33&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, yes, yes....

20:44:49&nbsp;
kristina
We, the Optimal Health Center, do offer hormonal testing.

20:45:00&nbsp;
kristina
I love that, Lisa!

20:45:26&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Yip, I remember you are a John Denver fan!

20:45:42&nbsp;
kristina
It still would be good to have your vitamin D levels tested, even if you are getting lots of sunshine and most insurance companies will now cover the tests, I believe.

20:46:12&nbsp;
Dave
Dreary East Coast could use a nice dose of Vit. D now!

20:46:22&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Maybe with Obama in office, we can afford these tests!

20:46:28&nbsp;
Billy the Kid
I don't want to hit 70 home runs for the Yankees. I just want to feel a little better or maybe a little younger:p 

20:46:52&nbsp;
Billy the Kid
Thanks for the info.

20:47:01&nbsp;
Mary A
Can OHC do that (Vit D) by hair sample  

20:47:05&nbsp;
kristina
I am working on my certification in Restorative Endocrinology:

20:47:09&nbsp;
kristina
Restorative Endocrinology? is our method of reintroducing patient and practitioner to their self-healing design and empowering them with tools to evaluate and restore balance and return to wellness. Specifically, we use testing methods to establish the individualized hormonal and metabolic pattern of a patient. One can then identify the most appropriate, effective, and least invasive method for restoring and sustaining endocrine balance. Provided with the proper physical and lifestyle support a person will respond rapidly, and normal endocrine function can return. 

20:47:33&nbsp;
kristina
No, we do not test for Vitamin D, at this point. I do know that you can get a test on the internet:

20:48:13&nbsp;
kristina
from ZRT Labs

20:48:38&nbsp;
michael b
is there still question about autism and shots for young children?

20:48:48&nbsp;
Mary A
OK thanks, 

20:49:02&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Kristina, didn't you say you like tanning beds as a source of vitamin D? 

20:49:05&nbsp;
kristina
Billy, are you thinking about taking testosterone?

20:49:13&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, I do.

20:49:59&nbsp;
Billy the Kid
I am thinking of talking to my doctor about it. I am more curious about it than serious.

20:50:50&nbsp;
kristina
It is the UVB rays of the tanning beds (and the sun) that trigger the synthesis of the vitamin D precursor in the skin.

20:50:56&nbsp;
kristina
sure

20:51:14&nbsp;
kristina
Feel free to talk with me. 

20:51:37&nbsp;
Billy the Kid
Thank you.

20:52:24&nbsp;
Cathy V
are other amounts of minerals in sea salt harmful or just not ideal until I get the right one???????

20:53:02&nbsp;
kristina
Here is some additional information about enema solution

20:53:19&nbsp;
Cathy V
thanks

20:53:41&nbsp;
kristina
It depends on the mineral you are talking about and how often you take enemas and what your current levels of electrolytes are in your own colon.

20:54:32&nbsp;
Cathy V
ok, does the hair analysis give clue to levels of mins in colon?????

20:54:47&nbsp;
Billy the Kid
What is your take on Omega#3 Fish Oil. I have started taking it and I seem to have reduced muscle fatigue when I finish playing a round of golf.

20:55:52&nbsp;
kristina
Here is some more information about male hormones, which us women also have:

20:56:02&nbsp;
kristina
 Traditionally, age-related male hormone changes were not considered problematic because fertility in men persists until an advanced age. In contrast, women undergo ovarian function failure and require multiple hormone replacements. More careful evaluation in males shows progressive age-related changes including: 

20:56:27&nbsp;
kristina
    *  Decreased muscle mass and strength     * Decreased vigor, low energy     * Decreased libido     * Insomnia     * Nervousness and Depression     * Hair loss 

20:56:43&nbsp;
kristina
These changes usually begin in the fourth and fifth decades and point towards hormone imbalances and deficiencies which may be considered the male equivalent of menopause, i.e. the andropause.

20:56:47&nbsp;
Carol45
Sorry to be so late, got called away late this afternoon.  Hello everyone.

20:57:26&nbsp;
kristina
Optimal health is dependent on the balance of hormones, and not just a single hormone. Currently, men with low androgen hormones can benefit from hormone replacement therapy. Also, men with imbalances in their androgen to estrogen and progesterone can also be hormone supplemented to achieve balance.

20:57:32&nbsp;
Billy the Kid
Same symptoms of aging!!!

20:57:47&nbsp;
kristina
Testosterone production in males is mainly a testicular function. Pituitary sex hormones (FSH and LH) stimulate and regulate this function. Specifically, LH (Luteinizing hormone) stimulates testosterone production in the testicles. This process is under negative feedback, meaning that testosterone levels regulate LH secretion. FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone) and testosterone stimulate sperm production.

20:58:11&nbsp;
kristina
Welcome, Carol. It is great that you are here, even if it is just for the last few minutes.

20:58:18&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Because the chat is almost over, I want to say I'm glad the chat was today, because  I'm in town, and can make it tonight. It's nice all of you made it, and it's always nice to have new members here!

20:58:19&nbsp;

hi carol45 glad you made the chat

20:58:28&nbsp;
Billy the Kid
Hi Carol.

20:58:50&nbsp;
kristina
And, on that note, we are about to close. This has been an excellent chat. At this rate, we could offer a chat once a week. If you are interested, email me and let me know good times and days for you.

20:59:01&nbsp;
Joseph
Thank you you too Kris and all!

20:59:03&nbsp;

I'll look forward to reading the chat in the archives. 

20:59:12&nbsp;
Cathy V
Yes I am

20:59:22&nbsp;
kristina
Using appropriate tests for monitoring hormone therapy is crucial in establishing the appropriate dosing regimen. This reduces the chance of undesirable side-effects and maximizes beneficial effects. For example, excessive use of androgens (testosterone, androstenedione, DHEA and testosterone derivatives) can activate subclinical prostatic tumors which are androgen-dependent. Monitoring is especially important in older males. By the age of 70, at least 50% of men have subclinical prostate cancer. These are especially susceptible to growth stimulation by androgens.

20:59:23&nbsp;
Billy the Kid
This time is fine with me.

20:59:29&nbsp;
Cathy V
I am interested in once a week

20:59:50&nbsp;
Carol45
Day and time is good for me too. :)

20:59:56&nbsp;
Cathy V
me too

21:00:07&nbsp;
Lisa P.
I'm interested too, and this day and time can work some of the time for me.

21:00:13&nbsp;
kristina
I look forward to being with you all next month, December 10th at 7pm. I do like the idea of at least two live chats each month. One at night and a second during the day!

21:00:23&nbsp;
