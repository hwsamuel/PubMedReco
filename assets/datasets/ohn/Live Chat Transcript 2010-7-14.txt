Good evening, everyone

Hey everyone! 

20:03:37

Hi.

20:03:46

Kristina,do you feel somewhat revolutionary in your chosen field?

20:03:49

Hello Kristina

20:04:06
kristina
Say more, Michael....

20:04:12
kristina
Hello!

20:04:49
kristina
Please chime in at anytime with your questions, concerns, comments, experiences related to the colon cleanse, overall health, your diet, your health concerns...

20:04:54
zand
Hi to everyone. I would like to ask Kristina to explain what one should feel during and after a therapeutic coffee enema, in particular as regards the gall duct, gall bladder and liver, and also compare it to the liver flush.  Thank you.

20:06:00
Dave
BillsE from the old forum asked me to say hello to veterans who might remember him.

20:06:28
kristina
One of the topics that I want to advance tonight is sugar cravings and how to deal with them and why they are an excellent tool to monitor one's overall health. 

20:06:45
kristina
Say hello back to him.

20:06:54
Dave
Will do.

20:07:05
kristina
Zand, I will unfold my answers to your request as we go along.

20:07:50

this day marks the start of the french revolution,when the peasants stormed the big jail, the bastille.

20:07:53
kristina
First of all, with both of these treatments - therapeutic coffee enema and a liver flush - different people are going to feel differently.

20:08:45
Bonnie B.
Hello there ;)

20:08:49
kristina
Welcome, Bonnie.

20:08:53
Bonnie B.
Hi!

20:11:24
Bonnie B.
I have recurring candida, large organisms, maybe from the hulda clark cancer fuzzy. you said they may be candida before....I can't seem to get rid of them

20:12:03
zand
I do realize people with different conditions and of different ages would react differently to both. So please state it for the average healthy person and then address some of the special cases.

20:12:16
kristina
The liver flush, using an assortment of items that may include fasting, large amounts of apple juice, olive oil, malic acid, etc., is, in many cases, not a good tool for tending to the gallbladder and thus the liver.

20:12:17
Bonnie B.
I have tried charcoal recently, which helps me feel better, but I keep flushing 40 to 50 when doing an enema.

20:13:16
wen
I have purchased a colon tube. How much of it is to be inserted? Is it safe to go 18 inches or more?

20:13:20
kristina
Bonnie, I have seen the cancer fuzzies, so I know just what you are talking about when you say that you are flushing them out.

20:13:34
Bonnie B.
I can't get rid of them!

20:14:13
kristina
Some people can safely insert the colon tube 18 inches or more. Read more 

20:14:19
michael b
are some sugars, like cane sugar, less toxic ?

20:14:31
edwinmaples
I like to give myself enemas at least two to three times a week and have been having good results.  Is there a better solution that would help me or a different additive that would give me better results?

20:14:39
kristina
Bonnie, you can get rid of them with the proper protocol.

20:14:50
Bonnie B.
How do I get the protocol?

20:14:55
Tom S
How often can a coffee enema be used for IBS?

20:15:32
kristina
Would you be willing to do a Comprehensive Stool Analysis?

20:15:53
kristina
    *  Stool culture for yeast and bacteria such as Blastocystis hominis     * Immunoassays for Giardia antigen, Cryptosporidium antigen and Clostridium difficile toxin     * Microscopic Ova and Parasite wet mounts, general stain and special stain     * Antibody IgA for Ameba histolytica     * Antibody IgG for Heliobacter pylori     * Fecal pH test     * Anti-Gliadin antibody test for Gluten Intolerance     * Digestion related screens for enzyme levels and immunochemical markers such as Chymotrypsin     * Intestinal function markers to evaluate irritation and inflammation; markers indicate overall status of gut immunity and integrity, i.e. occult blood, total intestinal SIgA, etc.

20:15:59
Bonnie B.
yes, anything at this point! I can't get better no matter what i have tried

20:17:03
kristina
Tom, it depends on how the body responds to the coffee enema. If the response is mostly that one feels better, then as much as daily. If the response of the body is to feel worse, than I wouldn't recommend the coffee enema more than one time a month, unless constipation is an issue.

20:17:39
kristina
Edwin, what results are you looking for? What enema solution do you use now?

20:18:44
kristina
The popular &quot;liver flushes&quot; with apple juice or grapefruit juice use too much sugar and are an extremely forceful way to rid the body of gallstones.

20:19:46
kristina
I recommend that people have a mini &quot;liver flush&quot; daily, using lots of olive oil in their diet. I also recommend eating lots of beets on a regular basis.

20:19:56
Michal H.
Hi!

20:20:28
kristina
In addition, we offer a whole food supplement called AF Betafood.

20:20:45
Tom S
Can a retention coffee enema be retained for longer than 20 min.?

20:20:56
michael b
how do you prepare beets?

20:21:23
kristina
AF Betafood contains beet juice which is a good source of betaine. Betaine has been shown to be an effective lipotrophic agent. Lipotrophic agents promote the transportation and use of fats, helping to prevent the accumulation of fat in the liver. Vitamin A has an important and specific effect on lipid metabolism. Bovine liver and orchic extract are important in the metabolism of blood fats.

20:21:51
wen
How does one know when the complete colon is cleaned of sludge that is at the cecum?

20:22:01
kristina
by using these protocols on a regular basis, one ought to feel great!

20:22:08
edwinmaples
I use Kirk's Original Coca Castile Body Wash on the first two enemas and then followed by at least two plain water enemas in a session.

20:22:12
Bonnie B.
I am finding a lot of undigested food during enema flushes as well...

20:23:29
zand
Kristina : You are likely familiar with Walter Last (Australia) and directions on his website for ridding oneself of Candida. If so, in connection with Bonnie's Q, do you recommend it?   I am sorry you are getting bombarded with missile questions from everyone.

20:24:02
Dana L
Hello, I have been giving myself enemas for 2 days in a row and skipped one day, today is the 3rd one this week. I feel a little gassy and bloated afterward. Am I doing something wrong? I am using coffee implants at the end of series.

20:24:03
kristina
I don't recommend retaining the coffee enema more than 20 minutes. I don't think there is any additional benefit after 20 minutes but you can certainly try it and report back your results.

20:24:34
Dana L
I am new at this also.

20:24:48
kristina
Some say one can tell when the colon is completely clean when the liquid from the colon runs relatively clear.

20:24:54
Bonnie B.
Sorry, I don't know chatroom etiquette, :) I will wait a bit!

20:25:08
kristina
I either juice my beets or cook them and make a beet salad.

20:25:37
kristina
I like the questions. And, thank you. It is a bunch to keep up with.

20:25:49
kristina
So ask again if I don't get to your issue within 5 minutes or so.

20:26:09
kristina
Welcome, Dana.

20:26:45
kristina
you are doing fine, Bonnie, just don't get offended if I don't answer you and feel free to ask again.

20:27:24
Bonnie B.
Great! Thanks :D 

20:27:37
kristina
Bonnie, I recommend you call the office, talk to DeeDee and set up a process to heal that lovely body of yours fully. You can also go online after the chat and order the stool analysis.

20:27:50
Brian F
Why am I not seeing the questions?

20:27:56
Bonnie B.
Perfect!

20:28:09
Lae B.
I have been retaining some of the enema and unable to expel (I do a water enema followed by a coffee enema) and I believe this is due to hemorrhoids which seem to swell after the water enema.  Is there anything I can do about this?

20:28:23
kristina
Additionally, I don't know what you have already tried to rid  yourself of the Candida. I had to work on that one for years, but now we all know a lot more than we did 10-15 years ago, so I know it doesn't need to take you that long. 

20:29:11
kristina
A good protocol which brings results quickly, which doesn't mean that one doesn't have to continue a rigorous healing program for months if not for a lifetime. It is well worth it though, that I am 100% confident of.

20:29:26
kristina
You can also join us on Madison OHC on Facebook to dialogue about these issues.

20:29:41
michael b
thanks for the beet answers. that won't be difficult for me, but i still keep a dictionary handy during these chats.

20:29:56
kristina
If you are struggling, ever, with sugar cravings, I recommend Gymnema.

20:30:27
kristina
It is a fabulous herb and works to restore sugar metabolism and pancreatic health.

20:30:43
kristina
If you want to be healthy, keep your blood sugar balanced!

20:30:45
kristina
Gymnema 4g contains a complex mixture of saponins (gymnemic acids) and other compounds. This product is standardized to contain 100 mg per tablet of gymnemic acids to ensure optimal strength and quality. The substances in Gymnema 4g work together to:     * maintain healthy blood sugar levels when combined with a balanced diet     * maintain normal cholesterol levels in a normal range ∆

20:30:53
kristina
Also, eat small meals often.

20:31:22
kristina
To learn more, go to my #1 Health Tip.

20:31:28
Bonnie B.
I have tried diets, yeast diets, lots of natural things that kill yeast, three lac, fasting, enemas, lots and lots of &quot;cures&quot; I have been tired extremely fatigued for 7 years now with limited success at completely healing. With your book I got pretty far...but still inundated with these cancer fuzzies.

20:31:58
kristina
Here are specific recommendations for Candidiasis

20:32:02
Bonnie B.
Thanks!

20:32:47
kristina
Since I posted this information on my website, I have learned so much more, so I would suggest that you work with us directly in order to benefit from the years of learning and the many clients we have worked with.

20:32:50
kristina
You are welcome.

20:33:12
michael b
is gymnema marketed under that name or, silly me, do you sell it?

20:33:48
kristina
I am glad to hear that by working through my book, Ten Days to Optimal Health, you improved your health a lot.

20:34:11
kristina
Yes, Michael, we sell it. It is a product from MediHerb.

20:34:20
Bonnie B.
Very much so, I can actually function now!

20:35:39
Dana L
Can enemas make you gassy and bloated? I am new at giving them to myself. The third one got a little better. Please advise.

20:35:40
kristina
I do think that Walter Last has a tremendous amount of excellent recommendations.

20:36:07
Bonnie B.
I went and got goats and we make our own kefir now. :) We are enjoying eating better, and the whole family has benefited from your ideas and knowledge you have passed on to us. Thanks!

20:36:13
kristina
It is important to eat regularly to keep your blood sugar steady all day and night. This will enable your adrenal glands to relax. It is the adrenal glands that raise the blood sugar between meals when we go more than 2½ hours without eating. Some people feel hungry, tired, unfocused, or perhaps hyper throughout the day as their adrenal glands compensate for the drop in blood sugar. Instead of having the stress hormones cortisol and adrenalin do the work to keep the blood sugar at a normal level, it is better to eat and let your adrenals take a vacation.

20:36:32
kristina
Yes, enemas can make you gassy and bloated.

20:36:52
kristina
What enema solution are you using when you take the enemas? How many enemas are you taking in the enema series?

20:37:13
Dave
Matter of introducing too much air with the water?

20:37:15
kristina
Wow! Bonnie! Thank you for sharing. I love hearing this sort of thing.

20:38:05
Dana L
I am using peppermint drops and celtic sea salt, taking 2 quarts, then 4 quarts, then the coffee enema. Is it possible there is to much air in my tube? How do I correct?

20:39:31
kristina
Run the water before you insert the nozzle. Try using only the sea salt and no peppermint. Try taking just a water enema or just a coffee enema. Experiment with all the elements to see if one of them is bothering you.

20:39:58
zand
Glad and very impressed to find you already had devised a candida program we didn't know about, Kristina.

20:40:06
Dana L
ok as long it is not uncommon, I will keep practicing.

20:40:58
kristina
If the troubles continue, consider having a Gastrointestinal GI Health Panel done to determine what is going on in your gut. For some, enemas only further exacerbate an imbalanced gut flora.

20:41:14
Mr TIM
Hi folk--Mr. Tim here,  late joining.

20:41:17
zand
Is the function of the celtic sea salt stated anywhere on the website or your book that I may have missed, Kristina ?

20:41:32
kristina
thanks, zand. I think that is quite a compliment coming from an alum of mit.

20:41:52
kristina
Have I missed anyone?

20:41:55

Lae B.
yes I have it and it hasn't helped.  i have also tried vitamin e.

20:43:32

hi kristina no questions just wanted to see how it works!

20:44:14
Mr TIM
Hi Kristina  Ch here

20:44:18
Lae B.
the benefits of the coffee enemas have been so great that i don't want to stop them, but it is becoming more difficult.

20:44:21
Lauren W.
Lae...I've gone to taking Vitamin C for swelling of hemorrhoidal tissue.

20:44:52
Lae B.
thank you lauren - i will increase my vit c

20:44:56
Lauren W.
When i was first told about trying it...I laughed...but after the 4th day of taking C it worked

20:45:03

Hemorrhoids - Collinsonia Root, AF Betafood, Gotu Kola

20:46:47
Lauren W.
i do have a question.  Can you actually change the pH balance of your body through enema usage...especially by using baking soda and soap?

20:46:50
Lae B.
thank you kristina

20:48:16
kristina
More on AF Betafood:

20:48:17
kristina
AF Betafood&reg;: This product is used to help thin the bile and promote better liver and gall bladder function. It assists in the conversion of fat to sugar. It is also a natural antibiotic which destroys harmful bacteria. This product helps with fat digestion, nausea, gas, bloating and right shoulder blade discomfort. Gallbladder problems usually cause pain or pressure in the right shoulder and upper back.

20:48:24
zand
In her books (such the Prevention of All Cancers), Dr. Clark says you cannot cleanse a liver infested with parasites and recommends first zapping them for a week.  I wonder if you have any other recommendations on making the coffee enema more effective?

20:49:46
kristina
Lauren, sorry, but I do not know. If anyone else knows about this, let me know, please.

20:49:51
Mr TIM
Re baking soda, I've found that soda makes soap suds enemas easier and more gentle and does increase their cleansing effect.

20:49:59
zand
Sounds great !  AF would be a very useful product

20:50:06
kristina
Yes, this is a fabulous chat turnout. thank you, all of you, for joining us!

20:50:22
wen
When a person does all three enemas - 2, 4, coffee - do you recommend implants? what about loss of magnesium, or something for the heart that keeps it functioning? not sure if it is magnesium.

20:50:26
kristina
Yes, call us if you need some AF Betafood.

20:50:59
edwinmaples
No worries mate.  Have gotten an lot of useful info.

20:51:11

and you sell AF Betafood. thanks again.

20:51:39

We recommend sea salt in at least one of the enemas. Also, we recommend a seasonal hair analysis to keep track of mineral levels.

I could google, but since I'm here, lol, what are cancer fuzzies what do I look for? And hello all. 

20:53:02
kristina
Hulda Clark popularized &quot;Cancer Fuzzies.&quot; You will need to read about them online or in one of her books.

20:53:35

Trace Minerals B12&trade;: This product is an excellent source for trace minerals. It will assist with endocrine weaknesses, low resistance to infections, anemia, and hypothyroidism.

20:55:31
zand
In response to your point about Lauren's question, my 2 cents is that one should change the pH systemically, by consumption of fruits and/or veggies, and not by external intervention (esp. avoid using an inorganic salt like sodium bicarbonate).

20:55:53
kristina
It is offered through Standard Process. We also offer.

Garlic is beneficial in maintaining a healthy immune and circulatory system and can help maintain normal cholesterol and triglyceride levels in individuals with healthy cholesterol levels. Garlic is also a powerful protector against damage from free radicals, molecules that injure cells and may be responsible for inappropriate cell division and growth.
