Hi, any and all.

13:01:16
randyu
Hello all.

13:02:09
JayJ
I have  a question about coffee enemas. Can I combine a coffee enema with green tea to take advantage of the antioxidants of the green tea or must they remain as separate sessions?

13:02:50
deedee
Welcome everyone!

13:03:06
Bob L.
Hello folks.  Hope you're having a good day.

13:03:31
deedee
Jay, you could certainly try the tea and coffee together.  Let me know how that goes. I have not tried that before.

13:04:15
deedee
Has anyone had a chance to check out our 2 new videos - with more to come?

13:04:24
JayJ
Was it 1 qt coffee and 1 qt green tea?

13:04:34
DaveC
Hope all are feeling well as summer starts.

13:04:51
randyu
Yes, DeeDee, the new videos are very good...

13:05:02
DaveC
How to access new videos?

13:05:10
Bob L.
Feeling wonderful here... Had my weekly massage and coffee enema therapy this morning.

13:05:23
Victoria
Anybody try green tea by GAIA with 1/4 teaspoon Castile soap per quart?

13:05:27
deedee
Jay, I would use only about 1-2 cups each and maybe somewhat watered down at first - so maybe 1 cup coffee, 1 cup tea, and 2 cups extra water.

13:06:22
JayJ
That makes good sense.

13:06:51
JayJ
Excuse my stupidity - what is GAIA?

13:06:56
deedee
Dave, you get our newsletter, don't you?  We have links on the newsletter and ones on enemabag.com and ones on optimalhealthnetwork.com.

13:08:13
DaveC
Somehow I seem to have not gotten newsletters for some time, but those links should work.

13:08:27
CatharineL
I am new here, but have been trying to get the newsletter for about 10 days or so. Have not gotten one yet.

13:08:51
deedee
Victoria I have not tried the tea and soap.  Does that work well?

13:09:16
Bob L.
I've never received a newsletter and signed up twice.

13:09:31
JayJ
Victoria, what is GAIA?

13:10:53
Victoria
GAIA is a brand name. It has liquid caps of green tea. Just cut the end and mix. Delightful! 

13:12:10
JayJ
Victoria, OK, thanks. Been brewing green tea; this is much faster! Will seek it out.

13:12:15
Bob L.
Did that about three days ago.

13:14:50
Victoria
I feel antioxidant effects whole body for hours! Wonderful! 

13:15:20
DaveC
Bob, how long is the massage? Mine is 45 minutes by my registered therapist, who also gives me colonics. 

13:15:32
Bob L.
I've been lying on massage table ever since the therapy session early today.

13:15:49
JayJ
Victoria - I assume you're doing a retention enemea. How long do you retain the fluid?

13:16:16
Bob L.
Yes... retain for an hour

13:16:54
Bob L.
but have said before on here, I am able tor release lying on massage table... with no mess.

13:18:40
Bill D
Hi, Bill here.

13:18:46
deedee
Welcome Bill.

13:18:50
CatharineL
Thanks so much!

13:19:00
Bill D
Thanks!

13:19:01
Bob L.
I try to be... and need to be... 

13:19:13
Bob L.
Got the word yesterday from oncologist I start chemo in about 90 days for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

13:19:35
DaveC
And I thought 45 minutes covered all the (legal) bases, lol.

13:19:38
Victoria
I find it easier to hold for about 10 minutes. Sometimes with 1/2 teaspoon of REAL SALT brand. 

13:19:48
JayJ
Victoria - do you add sea salt and baking soda to the solution as well? The traditional Mae West. I generally add a cup of Aloe Vera juice.

13:20:15
Bob L.
all legal

13:20:26
Bob L.
a nurse therapist

13:21:19
deedee
What are some other enema recipes that people have tried with success or not?

13:21:40
Victoria
Aloe Vera sounds great! 

13:21:57
Bob L.
I occasionally do Dr. Braggs cider vinegar and honey.

13:22:14
Bob L.
Good for the body orally and anally.

13:23:20
randyu
To all:  Why does the medical community frown on these alternate therapies that work and do much good?  These are much better than taking pills and no side effects except that they work.  Are doctors just not educated on this?

13:23:27
JayJ
Wheat grass enema is powerhouse of nutrition! Give it a try - be careful; the solution stains.

13:24:04
randyu
Plain water works fine for me...

13:24:10
Bob L.
A step backward... in the Thirties, Forties, and Fifties, the doctors did it.

13:24:38
Bill D
Other recipes?  I like just plain ol' Bi-carb and a few drops of Dr. Bronner's peppermint!!

13:24:54
Bob L.
I worked as a hospital orderly while in college in the early Fifties and gave enemas to males my entire eight-hour shift.

13:25:03
randyu
Yes, Bob, and in the 50's, 60's, and 70's, people were all healthier too!

13:25:13
deedee
Doctors are not educated on natural therapies because there is no money in it.  Also, they are supported by the pharma and so only get taught what is important to them.

13:25:28
Bob L.
You are so right.

13:25:32
deedee
Doctors only get about 1-4 days total of education on nutrition and they are never taught about supplements or herbs except to say that they are dangerous or not needed.

13:26:07
Bob L.
My oncologist asked me yesterday asked me what I did for my constipation.  I didn't tell him the truth!

13:26:37
randyu
Right, doctors are in with the drug companies, that is why they push that stuff.  Too easy to write a script.  

13:27:13
randyu
Too many chemicals in the body load it up...

13:27:20
Bill D
Back in the late 40's and 50's (my time growing up), our doctor seemed to always use the word in Rx for us kids to 

13:27:55
deedee
There are a few docs out there that are trying to incorporate natural remedies into their practices, but I don't think they are too supported.  It is usually because they had the interest about natural health themselves and got some education on their own.

13:28:13
DaveC
Most moms then didn't need a prescription  to get out the bag or can!

13:28:41
Bill D
That was for us kids to &quot;Dr. MOM&quot; the magic word was &quot;E-N-E-M-A!!&quot;

13:28:52
randyu
Right on, Dave... Home remedies worked...

13:28:52
Bob L.
It was a family ritual back then.  My first recollection in life was being given an enema in a doctor's office.

13:30:01
randyu
MD's used to support it; some DO's still do; ND's do also, also RN's and LPN's from back in that time support this stuff...

13:30:26
Bill D
Never got one in doctor's office, but doctor gave the Rx to Mom and we got it!!

13:30:42
Bob L.
My therapist I referred to is in her 60s, an LPN, who gave enemas most of her career.

13:30:45
deedee
The younger clients are really coming around and realizing that natural remedies can really work and are much better for you!

13:31:14
randyu
Glad to hear that, DeeDee... The younger people need to know that...

13:32:15
Bob L.
Even the preps for colonoscopies and sigmoidoscopies have changed with time.  

13:32:18
randyu
There is nothing wrong or shameful about enemas or colonics; they do work and help your body heal itself, without drugs!!!!!

13:32:27
Bob L.
Not too long ago, the prep was enemas until clear.

13:32:47
Bill D
My CT says she has lots of younger clients and they &quot;talk to their friends about it!!&quot; 

13:33:17
Bill D
Right on, Randy!

13:33:40
CatharineL
I'm 55, and was raised mostly in the 60s and 70s. My mother was an RN. I can remember having an enema bag hanging in our bathtub my entire life, but only had a few growing up.

13:34:01
randyu
About prep for colon tests, I hated to use all those laxatives, horrible; would rather have done enemas until clear...

13:34:08
Bob L.
Ditto re the bag in bathtub routine.

13:34:33
deedee
Yes, I get a lot of college age kids, people in sports, etc., that come here and I get a lot of referrals from them.  So many people have digestive issues so early on it seems - our diet and stress!

13:34:40
Bob L.
For sure, Randy.

13:35:17
deedee
Catharine, your mother must have taken them frequently, huh?

13:35:40
Bill D
Oh my! Diet and stress... Don't forget our toxic environment these days!

13:35:45
DaveC
Catharine, I assume your mom's enemas came during illness, as mine generally did. Suspect that was pretty common timing.

13:35:48
randyu
Yes, today's diets of junk and stress take a toll on the digestive tract.  Also, Harvard U. has now found that 95% of our serotonin for the brain is made in the gut!

13:36:40
randyu
A clogged gut, a foggy brain...

13:37:09
CatharineL
I just had a bladder surgery two weeks ago. The prep was 2 Fleets the night before. I will never do that again. It will be enemas until clear for me! The saline laxative in those was so harsh I was still sore two days later!

13:37:39
Bob L.
I detest Fleets... I can never seem to get it drained out of me.

13:38:00
Bill D
Hi Cat... Forget the Fleets!!

13:38:08
CatharineL
Yes, our childhood enemas were usually related to illness.

13:38:24
deedee
Yes, I think your enemas would have been much better than the Fleets.

13:38:30
Bill D
Hi Cat... mine too.

13:38:43
Bob L.
Yes, any illness at all, and I heard the enema bag being filled.

13:38:45
deedee
Welcome, Firestar.

13:38:57
CatharineL
Both my parents took them regularly, though, until their deaths.

13:39:07
DaveC
That certainly made those enemas more acceptable, Catharine.

13:40:02
Bob L.
Only issue I'm finding with my weekly enemas is they do add to the extreme fatigue of my leukemia; so I just sorta stay in bed all day that day of the week.

13:40:10
Bob L.
That's all a function of age.

13:42:03
CatharineL
I am so pleased to have found this site to learn about the enema series and the coffee enemas. I have not done that yet, but looking forward to giving it a try. I am on meds for several different things and maybe this will help me get off some of them.

13:43:14
Bob L.
I have a close friend who has several severe illnesses and her doctor has her on twice weekly enemas; and she is feeling better than in years.

13:43:18
deedee
I am glad you found us, Catharine.

13:43:45
Bill D
Hi Cat... Remember too, lifestyle and diet are right in there also!

13:44:07
Carrie J
Hi all.

13:44:24
Bill D
Hi Carrie.

13:45:50
CatharineL
Yes, Bill D, I am working on that as well.

13:46:04
Bill D
10-4

13:46:17
Carrie J
I have been watching OHN videos but not all done.  When do inserts work the best?  Any recommendations for leaky gut?

13:46:29
Bob L.
Lifestyle so important in the aging years.

13:46:37
randyu
Yes, Catharine, you may be able to cut back on the meds with enema therapy.  Pills all have side effects... not good.

13:47:31
Bill D
Pills usually all work through your LIVER and stress it out!  No wonder!

13:48:03
DaveC
Bob, interesting that childhood and late in life seemed to be &quot;enema times&quot; for many?

13:48:18
Bob L.
Unfortunately you reach a point in life where some pills are necessary to keep you alive.

13:48:27
randyu
Pills tax the liver and kidneys... and gut - that's why enemas and coffee enemas help...

13:48:38
Bob L.
You're right, Dave.

13:48:55
Bob L.
Too hectic a lifestyle in the working years.

13:49:46
DaveC
Gap of many years between the therapy.

13:50:40
Bob L.
I'm on leukemia, heart, Gerd, and dermatological meds... and I wouldn't be alive I suspect without them.  But the weekly coffee enemas don't seem to counter any of the meds.

13:51:01
CatharineL
Yes, and no one talks about them much. 

13:51:15
DaveC
Learning new stuff here, DeeDee? lol 

13:51:23
deedee
Implants work best after two cleansing enemas and at night if you can so that you can lie down and hold it for as long as possible (depending on the kind of implant, of course).

13:51:48
randyu
Does anyone know a good remedy for GERD?  Acid reflux?

13:51:59
deedee
An implant for leaky gut could be olive oil, aloe vera juice, and open capsules of MSM.

13:52:04
CatharineL
I was wondering what to expect after my first coffee enema, with all the toxins being released by my liver.

13:52:10
Bob L.
Have to say Nexium works well... been on it for years.

13:52:22
deedee
I do oral herb combos for leaky gut as well.

13:52:42
Bob L.
Shouldn't feel anything different as long as not too stringent on the coffee.

13:53:05
randyu
Any side effects with the Nexium? Over the counter?

13:53:10
Bob L.
Retention is the key, I feel.

13:53:24
Bob L.
No, it's a script and no side effects.

13:53:46
deedee
Randy, have you ever tried Aloe juice or licorice?

13:53:47
Bob L.
Of course varies with the person.

13:54:01
Bob L.
That licorice is good, DeeDee.

13:54:02
randyu
No, DeeDee, I have not.

13:54:22
Bill D
Licorice? Hmmmm?

13:54:24
Firestar
Question:  For a diagnosis of intestinal parasites and small intestine bacterial overgrowth, neither of which responded to antibiotics, would enemas possibly help?

13:54:32
deedee
Of course I mean the herb licorice root - not the candy!

13:54:46
Bill D
10-4

13:54:50
randyu
Good?

13:54:51
Bob L.
I take slippery elm for one of my illnesses, and that has worked wonders... together with hard candy lemonheads

13:55:05
Carrie J
Thank you. What about the coconut oil essential oils - are they used at bedtime?

13:55:28
deedee
Firestar - yes!  Enemas can definitely help - especially if you can do some herb/essential oil implants and include them in the enemas too.

13:56:17
deedee
Carrie, yes, the coconut oil and essential oil suppositories work best at bedtime.

13:56:45
Bob L.
and is great for body massage.

13:57:31
Bill D
We're about to round out our chat. It's been great, everybody!

13:57:48
randyu
Thanks all for this chat... Very good today.

13:58:01
Bob L.
Very enjoyable... but please, more notice on the website page.

13:58:01
randyu
Good luck and good health to all.

13:58:14
randyu
When is next chat, DeeDee?

13:58:17
DaveC
Hopefully here again here next Wed.

13:58:23
Bill D
Thanks again, DeeDee and Kris!

13:58:25
Bob L.
Hope so.

13:58:33
randyu
Thanks, DeeDee...

13:58:49
deedee
Yes, thank you everyone - good questions and great answers!  You guys can practically run this yourself.  I enjoyed just doing some &quot;listening&quot; today!
