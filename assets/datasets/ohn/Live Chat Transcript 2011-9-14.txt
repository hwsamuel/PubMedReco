Hello everyone...

20:00:16
Larry
Good evening everyone...break out the long pants and jackets!

20:00:35
kristina
Hey all. Please chime in whenever you are ready with questions, comments, experiences with health and colon cleansing.

20:00:38
kristina
Hello to all.

20:02:14
randyu
Has anyone ever had a problem with fish oil omega 3 and digestion?  It contains glycerin.

20:02:17
Dave
Hi all.

20:02:30
kristina
Tonight, to start, I want to welcome folks to share how they personally take care of themselves and how they came to do what they do now in their health regime. Personal experiences of what work are often our best teachers when it comes to taking care of ourselves.

20:02:54
kristina
It is not uncommon to burp up fish oil for quite some time after taking it.

20:03:02
kristina
What is your issue wiht fish oil, Randy?

20:03:18
randyu
I got really bad IBS symptoms from a batch of fish oil I was taking.  Fishy smell, and burping.

20:03:25
kristina
The sunset is beautiful here in Madison right now!

20:03:34
Larry
After getting back to normal from the spider bite, I'm back on more antibiotics for a fishhook I got buried in my finger.  Started daily enema series w/ coffee. Do I need to be concerned over too much salt in the solution if I stick to the guidelines?

20:03:37
randyu
Should I stop the fish oil?

20:04:04
kristina
Yikes, Randy. Yes, stop taking it if it is causing those symptoms.

20:04:24
kristina
How much salt do you use, Larry?

20:04:36
Larry
1 tsp per qt.

20:05:29
kristina
Also, are you taking probiotics? You need to take probiotics during and for at least one month after taking antibiotics to help your body restore a healthy balance of gut flora.

20:06:11
Larry
Yes on the probiotics.  They were a big help the last time.

20:06:34
randyu
What about Benefiber or Metamucil?  Can this cause IBS symptoms?

20:07:01
kristina
For probiotics, I recommend a cast of probiotic organisms to meet the diverse needs of a healthy gut.

20:07:44
kristina
Each strain of organism has a slightly different profile to maximize the different digestive environments.

20:08:09
Larry
I think I used the Ortho brand the last time.

20:08:13
kristina
Also, make sure the probiotics you take contain Saccharomyces boulardii.

20:08:33
kristina
A proven potentiator for good bacteria that removes pathogens for the gut.

20:08:56
kristina
Yes, those fiber supplements can irritate the gut.

20:09:24
kristina
Yes, Ortho Molecular's Ortho Biotic is an excellent, full-spectrum probiotic.

20:09:35
kristina
And, you don't need to refrigerate it.

20:09:42
Roger E
What would be a good starting formula for therapeutic suppositories using coconut oil, and can I get the ice cube trays?

20:10:14
kristina
Yes, we now carry the ice cube trays. Call or email the office. I will have them for  sale on the website with the September newsletter.

20:10:29
kristina
Roger, do you have any health issues you are working on?

20:10:44
kristina
Might other folks chime in on what do you do to support your health?

20:11:10
randyu
What about cleansing enemas?  Are they best done at home or by someone who does colon therapy?  

20:11:33
kristina
Roger, have you watched the short movie, How to Make Essential Oil Suppositories?

20:11:51
clyde e
Massages, colon therapy for detox, supplements  - exposed to toxic poisons.

20:12:01
kristina
Cleansing enemas can be done either at home or by a professional.

20:12:17
kristina
Unfortunately, there are very few therapist who offer enema therapy.

20:12:46
kristina
Thanks, Clyde. How often on each? What type of toxic poison? When?

20:13:43
Larry
If you're close enough to OHN, and want to learn, book an enema series and you'll learn what you need to know for your own series.

20:13:48
kristina
And, you can learn to give yourself at-home enemas that are equally therapeutic to professional colon hydrotherapy.

20:13:56
randyu
Shouldn't a nurse or tech do the enema for you?

20:13:57
kristina
Thanks for the tip, Larry.

20:14:33
kristina
We have multiple education materials guiding you through how to take at-home enemas. 

20:14:43
kristina
Small Volume Enemas

20:14:48
kristina
Large Volume Enemas

20:14:51
clyde e
Hexene, benzine and tolulene were the toxins.  Bi-weekly massages,  colon therapy weekly and bi-weekly.

20:14:52
kristina
www.optimalhealthnetwork.com

20:14:54
Larry
The videos were a help but DeeDee really taught me a lot and answered all my questions.

20:15:25
kristina
Yes, having someone give you an enema series is the best teacher. We can also use video chat to help you at home, if you live far away.

20:15:44
clyde e
Weekly is usually a 4 quart and biweekly is 2 quart.

20:15:49
kristina
Starting coconut oil implants are:

20:16:41
kristina
Coconut oil and Peace and Calming Essential Oil

20:16:52
kristina
Coconut oil and Purification Essential Oil

20:16:59
randyu
What about the ready-made Fleets at the pharmacy?

20:17:09
Roger E
Thanks!  I am in robust health, but I have always needed to help my system a bit, and have used enemas for this and general health. Sometimes my stomach or colon just feels a little raw, and needs something soothing.

20:17:16
kristina
Coconut oil and Frankincense Essential Oil

20:17:27
clyde e
Having the correct equipment is the key to doing the colon therapy at home.

20:17:43
kristina
Yes, the correct equipment makes all the difference.

20:17:57
kristina
On www.enemabag.com we offer an enema equipment buying guide.

20:18:12
kristina
You can also call us any time and we will help you set up your in-home enema equipment.

20:18:26
clyde e
It is where I got my information and it was a great help.

20:19:32
randyu
What about the Fleets over the counter?

20:19:55
kristina
The Fleet enemas clean only the rectal area and sigmoid area (if you are lucky) of the colon so I do not recommend them.

20:20:28
Dave
Probiotics are also vital after a colonic or enema series, right?

20:20:40
kristina
When you clean the colon,  you want to clear out the entire colon - sigmoid, descending, transverse, and ascending colon.

20:21:02
clyde e
Fleets are OK for a small enema. When you are needing deep cleaning of the whole colon then you need the enema nozzle that goes up further in the colon.

20:21:03
kristina
Yes, if you are using regular enemas, take a daily probiotic. No matter how good your health is.

20:21:30
kristina
Not the chemical Fleets but the new natural aloe vera ones are fine.

20:21:45
kristina
However, I do recommend against the disposable enema equipment.

20:22:34
Dave
Mean the vinyl plastic ones?

20:23:21
randyu
Years ago, the doctor's office would give enemas; many don't do this now, right?

20:23:44
Larry
I briefly ran out of the made-for-enema coffee beans.  Was the light roast coffee a better choice over a dark roast?

20:24:49
clyde e
If you find a colon therapist you will be alright.  Many in the Dallas area have closed.  I think there are only 5 or 6 that still offer the service.

20:25:13
kristina
I mean Fleet disposable.

20:25:48
kristina
I believe there are very few, if any, doctors that give enemas in the US. This could be different in other countries.

20:26:18
kristina
Yes, lightly roasted is better but air-roasted is best.

20:26:36
kristina
There are colon therapists in Dallas that offer enemas?

20:26:46
Roger E
Can you implant liquid vegetable glycerin as a substitute for a traditional suppository?

20:26:50
Dave
OK. I find the 1.5-liter all-in-one (tube instead of nozzle) a good tool sometimes.

20:27:23
kristina
Yes, Roger, you can. We even offer vegetable glycerin on our website. You can also add the essential oils to the glycerin.

20:27:54
kristina
Yes, Dave, I agree. The one we offer can be reused, if cleaned properly.

20:28:04
Roger E
Thanks!

20:29:16
Dave
Also is not as heavy as a rubber bag so easier to hang up.

20:31:42
kristina
More reasons to cleanse your colon on a weekly (at minimum) basis: Do you know that lymphatic fluid is drained from the entire colon?

20:32:59
kristina
Lymph fluid is responsible for moving toxins away from healthy cells and carrying germ-fighting materials to cells when they are under attack by viruses. (I believe this is one reason why taking enema to avoid and alleviate flus is such a useful technique.)

20:33:00
Dave
By weekly, do you mean a &quot;good&quot; enema or at least 2?

20:33:40
kristina
Though this fluid movies through the lymphatic system, it does not have its own pumping mechanism.

20:33:49
Roger E
A close friend was just diagnosed with mild diabetes.  Is there anything I can tell him to do about cleansing, etc., that he probably doesn't know?

20:34:20
sue w
I am just joining in.

20:35:10
kristina
Regular colon cleansing assists the lymphatic system to help the body produce a more optimal flow of lymph fluid, thus improving the removal of toxins away from healthy cells (and keeping them healthy) and improving the flow of germ-fighting materials to cells, as needed.

20:35:49
Alan D
Sorry all - had to do a quick change. This back injury has made me urinary incontinent.

20:36:02
kristina
The 10-day diet available in the Optimal Health Network library is an excellent resource for alleviating diabetes.

20:36:20
sue w
I do have a question. I have found that when, per your suggestion, I add a small amount of salt to my enema solution, I don't get cramps. This really amazed me. I was avoiding salt because I have high blood pressure.

20:36:21
kristina
Also, I recommend a weekly colon cleanse, if not daily during the beginning of a program.

20:36:48
kristina
I also have an entire article in the OHN library entitled Diabetes Solutions.

20:37:04
Alan D
My question is which Delrin nozzle would any of you recommend for someone with hemmorhoid and fissure issues?

20:37:17
kristina
As long as you are using a high-quality sea salt with your enemas, you will not affect your blood pressure.

20:37:18
FireS
So many sources say enemas that frequently (e.g. weekly) are not good.  Comments?

20:38:05
sue w
Thanks. Yes, I am using organic Celtic, etc. But why does the salt make such a big difference insofar as helping with cramping?

20:38:42
Roger E
I'll get it for him. Thank you.

20:38:44
Larry
I was disappointed to read the article in the last Reader's Digest that blasted colon cleansing and coffee enemas.

20:39:20
kristina
I see I have missed a few comments so I will try to address all of them now:

20:39:22
sue w
That tells you more about Reader's Digest than about colon cleansing. 

20:39:30
kristina
By weekly, I mean an enema series of 3 enemas. 

20:39:52
Dave
Thanks.

20:39:59
kristina
Welcome, Sue.

20:40:08
sue w
Thanks, Kristina. 

20:40:14
kristina
No problem, Alan.

20:40:51
kristina
If you have concern about your individual colon cleanse needs, we recommend a seasonal hair tissue mineral analysis.

20:41:14
kristina
We work with lots of folks who have taken daily enemas for years for one reason or another.

20:41:33
Larry
I just made two more converts to Ancient Minerals for cramping issues.

20:42:21
kristina
As long as you keep track of your electrolyte levels, intestinal flora, and gut integrity, daily enemas appear to be safe and often healthier for those in need than not taking a daily enema.

20:42:36
Dave
Years ago, colonics and enemas probably were approved of by Reader's Digest. Very conservative then.

20:42:42
kristina
Sue, Reader's Digest? What do you mean?

20:43:11
FireS
Thanks, K.

20:43:28
Roger E
It is too bad that so many people don't listen to their own bodies first.

20:43:32
sue w
Yes, a sour joke. So much in the media is really meant to keep people ill, buying pharmaceuticals and supporting doctors and hospitals.

20:43:59
FireS
What is the easiest way to keep track of your electrolyte level?

20:44:00
Larry
Article on &quot;Mad Medicine: When Alternatives Go Too Far&quot;

20:44:20
kristina
Yes, Sue, it is VERY unfortunate.

20:44:53
kristina
Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis - It is inexpensive, to be used seasonally and comes with a consultation.

20:46:29
FireS
Do you have to go to a doctor or does OHN do the Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis?

20:46:44
Larry
Starting to think about a fall fast.  Is it better to do the HTMA before or after?

20:46:47
kristina
Sea salt adds minerals to the water, which makes the enema solution much less irritating to the tissues of the colon.

20:46:56
Dave
Enemas as needed for me from early childhood. Colonics last 12 years and doing fine. Thanks Kris!

20:47:09
kristina
Never use iodized salt for an enema because iodine is harmful to the colon.

20:47:25
sue w
I am amazed by this simple addition that makes the process so much easier. 

20:48:02
FireS
How much sea salt per quart?

20:48:52
sue w
How does one stay aware of electrolytes, gut integrity, flora, etc.? I am doing daily enemas and thought that a sudden &quot;healing crisis&quot; may have been caused by some new type of imbalance.

20:49:03
kristina
One teaspoon of sea salt to each quart of water.

20:49:12
razoriowa
  Sea salt really helps me with retention during a series.

20:49:28
kristina
It is better to do the HTMA before a fast.

20:49:42
kristina
OHN does the HTMA.

20:49:48
razoriowa
Does position during an enema make a lot of difference?

20:49:59
kristina
Thanks, Dave.

20:50:04
FireS
Thanks for the salt and HTMA answers :)

20:50:15
kristina
Yes, it is amazing, isn't it, Sue?

20:50:41
sue w
Yes. amazing. A key element possibly understated.

20:50:52
kristina
Sue, staying aware of electrolytes, gut integrity and flora is a process that one learns over time.

20:51:06
kristina
It is more of an art than a science.

20:51:14
kristina
A good place to start is the seasonal HTMA.

20:51:26
kristina
Also, I take a daily probiotic and have for years.

20:51:32
kristina
I also drink Kombucha daily.

20:51:39
sue w
I was just thinking this, to do the HTMA.

20:51:48
kristina
And, I stay away from gluten, which is often the cause of leaky gut.

20:51:55
kristina
Great, Sue.

20:52:14
kristina
FireS, you are very welcome.

20:52:18
sue w
I really want to learn this art. Self responsibility for my health.

20:52:34
kristina
Yes, art. Yes, self responsibility for a lifetime.

20:52:52
Larry
Since Kefir is available in the local supermarket, I've been using a lot of it.

20:53:08
Roger E
Do you like chlorophyll or sesame oil as an implant after a series?

20:53:10
kristina
Kefir is a great idea.

20:53:23
kristina
Chlorophyll - yes.

20:53:28
kristina
Not sure about sesame oil.

20:53:50
kristina
Next live chat, September 28 at noon with DeeDee Delkamp.

20:54:26
kristina
More on how to keep electrolytes, gut integrity and flora in good balance:

20:54:32
kristina
Drink lots of quality water.

20:54:37
Dave
Will try to get there.

20:54:47
sue w
Thanks.

20:54:51
Roger E
Thank you Kristina!

20:54:58
kristina
Use essential oil suppositories at least once a month, if not once a week.

20:55:07
Larry
Thanks for the info tonight.  Time to let my finger recover. 

20:55:08
kristina
Eat locally grown food.

20:55:29
kristina
Keep your carbohydrate intake in balance with your high-quality protein and healthy fats.

20:55:33
sue w
Essential oil suppositories?

20:55:42
kristina
Stay away from food additivies and chemicals.

20:55:59
sue w
Juice.

20:56:56
kristina
Essential oils and their volatile constituents are used to address gut integrity and healthy flora balance. 

20:57:28
kristina
Broad scientific evidence exists that the colon is a more effective delivery system than the mouth for these therapeutic agents.

20:57:50
Dave
Night all, be well.

20:58:01
kristina
Essential oils promote the healing of the lining of the colon, reduce inflammation, and promote a healthy flora balance.

20:58:21
kristina
Sue, there is more on our website, www.optimalhealthnetwork.com

20:58:24
kristina
Good night all.

20:58:34
sue w
Thanks!
