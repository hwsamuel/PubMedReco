Hey folks! Welcome.

What % of water does an enema give for our daily needs? I have a hard time drinking a lot of water a day.

20:04:11
Dave
Hi all

20:06:47
kristina
Hey Dennis. Good question, but I have no idea.

20:06:52
dennis
How can I prevent the colon tube from curling inside and coming out?

20:10:10
dennis
I assume some water needs are taken in by our body, because after I hold an enema inside for at least 20 minutes, I urinate regularly about every 45 minutes after the enema for about a half a day.

20:10:22
kristina

20:10:22
Dave
Does anyone else need a &quot;restarter&quot; enema two days after a colonic or good e-series? Frequent with me.

20:10:45
kristina
Above all, never force a colon tube.

20:11:27
michael b
happy august to every one at this chat

20:11:33
kristina
I wouldn't use a colon tube for your first enema in a series.

20:11:53
Ray J
Hi Kristina. Can I already us the Frankincense with goat's milk for a small volume enema? Can I use the same for high volume enema as well?

20:12:10
kristina
I would clear the colon and then use the colon tube for possibly the second and certainly the third enema in the series.

20:13:24
kristina
Yes, do use the soaps for a small volume enema. This is often the best time to use the soap.

20:13:52
kristina
Once the colon is clear of solid stool,  it is much easier to insert the colon tube deeply.

20:14:04
kristina
Notice the natural curve in the colon tube.

20:14:33
kristina
When you insert the colon tube, insert it in such a way that the curve of the colon tube follows the curve of the colon.

20:15:36
kristina
Yes, you can use the soap for high volume enemas as well. It is best to take another fill into the colon after the enema soap.

20:16:08
kristina
Thanks, Michael. Happy August to you, too. How is it that time passes more quickly as we age?

20:16:13
dennis
Thanks Kristina for your input. I've got to leave now. By everyone!

20:16:27

bye dennis

Has anyone had a chance to check out the Optimal Health Network's blog?

20:19:18
Dave
How do we access?

Kristina,has every thing worked out well with guatemalan coffee source?

20:20:11
kristina
The link to the blog is on the home page

20:20:44
Dave
Thanks, will check.

20:20:59
kristina
Michael, the process of sourcing our coffee has been a very long and interesting process.

20:22:08
michael b
great, you will not be dying of boredom.

20:22:09
kristina
Part of the issue is cost: there is more expense directly to the consumer when fairly traded, shade-grown coffee is used.

20:22:50
kristina
The Guatemalan coffee is probably one of the more higher priced coffee sources on the market. But, get this, the families on the farm make only $1,000 per year.

20:23:09
kristina
However, gas and so many other services cost the same as they do here.

20:23:45
kristina
No, dying of boredom is certainly not a risk in my life. I hope not in the lives of anyone.

20:23:56
kristina
As life is so intensely interesting.

20:25:00
michael b
and now you are making me laugh.

20:25:23
kristina
why?

20:25:47
Ray J
I just received my first bag of enema coffee from your site. I am looking forward to trying it.  Thank you for what you are doing.

20:26:38
kristina
Your are very welcome, Ray. Thanks for using our products and services as you take care of yourself.

20:27:04
kristina
Have you taken coffee enemas before?

20:27:32
kristina
Check out our new Vitamin D Therapy Tanning Bed Systems for Home Use that we now offer on our site.

20:28:17
Ray J
Yes, a couple with not made for enema coffee. So I wanted to do it right.

20:30:07
kristina
Might you talk to us about why you take coffee enemas and what results you have seen so far?

20:31:04
kristina
In my most recent blog post, I tell an interesting story about how intensive care units are handling heart attacks that used to kill people. 

20:31:09
Ray J
I started it for the liver cleanse and just looking to better health.

20:31:18
kristina
Historically, when one’s heart stops and is restarted, there is an inflammatory response in the brain, caused by the unmediated restoration of blood flow after six to ten minutes of inactivity. This inflammation is generally fatal.

20:31:29
kristina
This new solution to acute inflammation in the brain is called therapeutic hypothermia: Ice the patient’s body to lower their temperature by about six degrees and induce a coma for up to 24 hours. This process limits inflammation and can allow people to return to a healthy life after their heart has been inactive for up to twenty minutes.

20:32:36
kristina
That is great, Ray.

20:32:45
kristina
 Why should I work to keep my colon healthy?

20:32:53
kristina
Many people focus on their outward health and forget that colon health is essential to one's overall well-being. In fact, the Center for Disease Control (CDC)  reported that in 2006, over 139,000 people were diagnosed with colon cancer and over 53,000 people died from colon cancer. Obviously colon health cannot be ignored. Besides pursuing colon health for the prevention of colon cancer, having a healthier colon can promote weight loss, increase energy, reduce fatigue, and even cure headaches. However, the answer is not getting the quick fix with pharmaceuticals. While many prescribed drugs can reduce or even eliminate symptoms of colon problems, they do not address a fundamental lack of colon health.

There was actually a study published recently that loneliness kills more people yearly than smoking does.

Health Risks of Loneliness Comparable to Smoking, Alcoholism and Obesity Thursday, July 29, 2010 

20:38:51
kristina
A recent scientific review involving more than 300,000 people across several previous studies has revealed that inadequate social networking and frequent isolation can have negative effects on a person’s health equal to that caused by smoking and alcohol abuse. It was found that those who experience sufficient social interactions were 50 per cent more likely to be alive when re-examined eight years later than those who were more socially isolated

20:39:17
Dave
It seems that colon-rectal cncer was not as widespread, or at least dealt with publicly in past days. Could wide use of enemas and other colon care back then have helped keep cancer down?

20:39:42
kristina
Possibly, Dave. Also, diets were better.

20:40:21
kristina
Make sure to strain the coffee from the grounds well before you put the coffee into your enema bag.

20:41:17
kristina
Why am I at risk for colon cancer and other colon problems? Our food has changed in leaps and bounds in a relatively short time, while our digestive system, particularly our colon, has not been able to keep up. For thousands of years we survived on basic foods such as fruit, game meat, nuts, and wild vegetables. However, in the last hundred years particularly, food has changed drastically: grain-fed meats, potato chips fried in trans fats, and dairy produced with hormones now line the shelves of many grocery stores. These toxins and unnatural foods can clog the colon and may increase the risk of colon cancer.

BYU professors Julianne Holt-Lunstad and Timothy Smith report in the journal PLoS Medicine that social connections - friends, family, neighbors or colleagues - improve our odds of survival by 50 percent. Here is how low social interaction compares to more well-known risk factors:
- Equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes a day - Equivalent to being an alcoholic - More harmful than not exercising - Twice as harmful as obesity “The idea that a lack of social relationships is a risk factor for death is still not widely recognized by health organizations and the public,” write the PLoS Medicine editors in a summary of the BYU study and why it was done.

20:44:37
Ray J
Kristina, gotta run. Thanks again for all your hard work. Wish you the best. Look forward to chatting again. Take care.

20:46:08
kristina
All this talk of social networks brings to my mind what it seemingly took for my mother to fully recover from her stroke last year.

20:46:43
kristina
She wasn't recovering very well at all and a strong enough social network seemed, to me, to be a big part of the issue.

20:46:54
kristina
Yeah, I would visit with her once a week but this simply wasn't enough.

20:47:01
kristina
So, I decided to get her a puppy. 

20:47:10
kristina
Wow! What a difference having this dog has made to her life.

20:47:22
kristina
She has SOOOO many more friends in the condo where she lives now.

20:47:48
kristina
She feels a part of the community where she lives now. She hadn't felt this, or really been this before.

20:48:20
kristina
And, she is doing so much better. She looks younger now than she did 2 year ago, before her stroke.

20:48:55
poppajoejr
kristina, later. gotta go, so long

20:49:30
kristina
She is exercisng more also. But given that it is only walking and not rigorously, I really think it is the new social network that has made all the difference.

20:49:54
kristina
Next live chat is August 25th at 12 noon central time.

20:49:58
kristina
I hope you can join me.

I agree the better diet  a century ago had at least as much to do with proper bowel function, whether with the aid of enemas or not.

20:50:27
kristina
Thanks, Michael, for bringing up this topic. It is a very good one that I don't talk about enough, but I know it is true.

20:51:04

there is a book out now, called The Supermarket Is Killing Me. I do not think I'll read it. my cat still bites me, but not as hard as she used  to. that's great about your mother.

20:51:38
