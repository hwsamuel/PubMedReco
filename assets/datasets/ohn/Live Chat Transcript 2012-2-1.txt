Welcome, Dave and Larry.

13:02:00
deedee
Welcome, Derek.

Hello DeeDee!

13:02:12
DaveC
Hi all.

13:02:38
Larry
Hi everyone... Sure beats the huge snow storm last year at this time!

13:03:10
derekj
How is everybody?

13:03:32
deedee
Larry, did you want to bring up your question?

13:04:06
Larry
DeeDee... sent you an e-mail earlier today and need a recommendation on essential oils for this skin cancer problem.

13:05:37
Larry
Also wanting to know about doing the e-series 4-5 times/week with coffee.

13:07:20
deedee
Yes, Larry, the oils that I would recommend for this are frankincense, tsuga, orange, lavender, tea tree. 

13:07:54
deedee
You can use that topically or inside the colon.

13:08:12
Dennis c
If too much salt is not good for us, how will the sea salt in our enemas effect us down the road?

13:08:58
derekj
If I'm not mistaken, Dennis, sea salt is good for us.

13:09:08
derekj
iodine table salt = bad

13:09:13
DaveC
Do the oils absorb quickly in the rectum?

13:09:50
deedee
Larry, you could definitely do the enema series 4-5 times per week for a couple of weeks, and then take a break and do less.

13:10:09
Dennis c
Good to hear!

13:10:49
Larry
Thanks DeeDee.  I have most of those oils already.  Will likely stay away from topically applied to not alter the Fluorouracil being applied in the same way.

13:11:44
deedee
Dennis, sea salt is balanced with many minerals, so you are not getting straight sodium like in table salt.  This sea salt is very good for you. It balances your electrolytes and makes the cleanse more effective.

13:12:47
Larry
Can these oils be incorporated into the coffee for the last retention or simply be used in a suppository?

13:13:02
deedee
Dave, yes, the oils do absorb quickly.

13:13:21
DaveC
I have read some place that sea salt is not as pure as mined salt because it contains contaminants.

13:13:48
deedee
Larry, you can use the oils in the coffee.

13:14:23
derekj
Oils work good in an implant after cleansing.

13:14:32
Dennis c
Am I right by saying that you use one level teaspoon of sea salt for one quart of water?

13:14:37
Larry
You might want to stick w/ sea salt for the benefit of the additional minerals.

13:14:56
deedee
Yes, you do have to really read the package so you are picking a pure, unrefined salt.

13:15:16
derekj
I have been using Celtic sea salt for about a year and no issues for me.

13:15:50
derekj
Dennis, that is the amount I use.

13:16:05
derekj
2 tsp for my 2-quart can.

13:16:07
Larry
Derek... ditto here on Celtic salt.

13:16:36
deedee
Yes, there is a good book called Salt Your Way to Health by David Brownstein, MD, that is a good read and explains salt very well and all the different types.  You can borrow it from our office if you are in the area.

13:16:37
derekj
I am low on sodium so I always add Celtic salt.

13:17:12
deedee
Good idea, Derek.

13:17:56
derekj
Well, I stole it from you DeeDee, hehe.

13:18:05
DaveC
When did salt &quot;replace&quot; soap (usually Ivory) as the preferred enema ingredient, or was it there all along?

13:18:42
derekj
I found the soap to be a bit violent and not as soothing as salt.

13:19:23
derekj
I tried 2 drops of castile soap and went back to just salt and peppermint oil with others mixed in for my needs.

13:19:24
DaveC
Just referring to soap in context of the classical home enema.

13:19:53
derekj
I think many people still like soap, just what works for you?

13:19:55
deedee
I think the more we learn about  enema health, the more we learn of better things to use in the enema.  We are really forging the way now with essential oils and herbs in the colon too, which you wouldn't have heard of too much back then.

13:21:04
DaveC
I think they stuck with basics then.

13:21:05
deedee
Soap can definitely be purging and can be irritating for some, so salt and oil do seem to be more gentle.  I think we have gotten away from the old notion that you need to be in pain and cramping to get a good enema.  We all know that is not true.

13:22:38
derekj
I find them to be relaxing, even after the coffee.

13:23:00
DaveC
Maybe that's in part why old-time enemas were remembered negatively.

13:23:19
deedee
Hello cmntlrl.

13:23:54
derekj
Dave, I think health care in general was a bit crude in the early days lol.

13:24:07
deedee
Dave, I think you are right.  They wanted them to really work and they thought pain and cramping were the only way.  We know now that they can be done very relaxing and therapeutically.

13:25:15
derekj
Quite often I do my coffee enemas before bed time, so the theory they are &quot;stimulating&quot; does not apply to everyone.

13:25:52
DaveC
They promised the patient would feel better after the enema, not during it.

13:26:24
derekj
DeeDee, I had a question when you are ready.

13:26:26
deedee
That is very true. Many people are relaxed by the coffee enema.

13:26:37
deedee
Ready, Derek.

13:27:13
derekj
My son who is 16 has started to mention his lower back gets sore.  I was wondering if there was something I could apply topical to help his back?

13:27:45
deedee
Derek, do you know what the soreness is from?  Sports, injury, etc.?

13:27:45
Dennis c
My proctology examine went well WITHOUT any chemical from the hospital for prep. I smiled when I saw how clean I was on the TV monitor as they went into the colon. No one knew but me what I did! A last-minute enema 2 hours before worked.

13:28:04
deedee
Good for you, Dennis. Yeah!!

13:28:12
derekj
Sports and overstraining it. He plays basketball every week for school.

13:28:14
deedee
Welcome, Lou.

13:28:26
Lou P
Thank you.

13:28:47
deedee
I have a sixteen-year-old who plays basketball too - as well as my 12-year-old son and 10-year-old daughter!

13:28:53
derekj
That's awesome, Dennis.

13:29:01
derekj
Cool!

13:29:25
Larry
Dennis C... good to hear since I go through that every 3 years and they've now gone to an entire GALLON of that crud for prep!!!

13:29:30
derekj
My son eats the &quot;SAD&quot; diet so I fear he is carrying some toxins causing soreness.

13:29:51
Dennis c
The 12:00pm chat time works out much better for me. Keep it up!!

13:30:38
derekj
Wow, a gallon!  That stuff is sooo violent, never again! 

13:30:41
deedee
My son sees a good sports medicine chiro friend of my here in Madison, but at home, I give him some trigger point rubs and I use PanAway oil, or clove, Helichrysum, wintergreen, cypress and Aroma Siez.

13:31:31
deedee
Those oils seem to work really well.  You do not have to use all of them at once.  PanAway and Aroma Siez are blends.

13:32:25
derekj
Thanks, DeeDee!

13:32:35
Dennis c
Hey Larry, you bet!! A gallon enema is better than a gallon of that junk they give you to swallow. Yeah!!

13:33:24
derekj
Ya, I agree Dennis. Save the junk to use as antifreeze in the car.

13:33:31
Lou P
Had to go through that a couple of weeks ago. Terrible to drink 1/2 gallon of that in so short a time.

13:33:31
deedee
Yes, you can definitely prep for the colonoscopy just fine with a little fasting and some good cleansing, either with colonics or enemas.  Many people cannot tell their doctors they did this, though, or they would refuse to do the colonoscopy.

13:34:31
deedee
That stuff is so toxic.  Then you are having to cleanse just to remove the toxins of the stuff you have to drink.  It is very hard on the kidneys and liver.

13:35:09
Larry
DeeDee... just wondering if you've started the Chinese medicine (massage) with the colon cleansing yet and how it's going?

13:35:10
Lou P
Why don't they tell you that? I have some kidney issues.

13:35:12
DaveC
I hedge my bets on prep by having a colonic and cutting down the &quot;go lightly&quot; drink. Worked fine twice.

13:35:33
Dennis c
I need your advice. Should I let my doctor know what I did?

13:36:15
derekj
Dennis, I wouldn't.

13:36:21
Larry
The kidney issues are why they've stopped the Phospho soda prep.

13:36:55
deedee
Dennis, you could, just to educate them once in a while, that there are different and better ways.  I'm sure you probably won't get a good response unless you have an open doctor.  I would not tell him before the exam, though.

13:37:02
deedee
Welcome, George.

13:37:21
George H.
Thanks.

13:38:02
DaveC
Dennis, a good time to &quot;confess&quot; was when the doc noted how well prepped you were.

13:38:27
deedee
Larry, I am sure that they do not perceive the stuff as toxic, so probably do not even think about how it is affecting the rest of your body.

13:39:37
Dennis c
No, I won`t tell him BEFORE the exam. The next time I have this done in 5 years, I will mention to the WHOLE surgery staff in that room what I did.

13:40:13
deedee
Sounds like a good idea.

13:40:31
DaveC
Good for that.

13:41:53
derekj
toxins = good for repeat business

13:42:20
deedee
Yes, I deal a lot in toxins! 

13:42:53
derekj
No shortage of those for sure!

13:43:22
Dennis c
If ever you needed me to help you in your work to help explain to a group about my experiences with enemas, you know how to get ahold of me.

13:43:54
deedee
Do any of you have any other health issues you or your family are facing right now?

13:44:46
deedee
George, do you have any questions or topics you would like to bring up?

13:45:35
DaveC
Constipation from meds, but that seems to be a universal problem.

13:45:54
deedee
I have recently seen a huge amount of people with adrenal fatigue and thyroid problems.  This seems to affect so many people and they are not even aware sometimes.

13:46:12
Dennis c
Signing off for now. Everyone have a great spring!!

13:46:22
derekj
Take care, Dennis.

13:46:22
deedee
Thanks, Dennis. You also.

13:47:11
derekj
What kind of meds, Dave?

13:48:00
derekj
Pain killers really messed me up. Have struggled with it since.

13:48:30
George H.
I have chronic constipation. Not exactly sure why.  Not sure if I should use plain water in enemas. Anything else may be too irritating for me.  I have a lot of stomach pain.

13:48:54
deedee
Dave, I know there are many medications that do cause the side effect of constipation. They overwork the liver also which affects the colon's ability to work well.

13:49:27
DaveC
Heart and muscle issues, and antibiotics of all sorts are constipating, as is well-known.

13:50:03
deedee
George, yes, a nice warm enema with filtered water could really help.  You could use a small amount of sea salt in the water also.  It is very gentle.  Use only 1 tsp. in the bag at first to see if that feels OK.

13:50:59
deedee
Yes, and antibiotics kill off the natural/good bacteria in our digestive system that actually help us to digest, break down food and waste, and eliminate it.

13:51:17
derekj
George, when I started adding salt, it made the water easier to accept into the colon so it might help with comfort factor.

13:51:45
deedee
George, have you ever done enemas before?  What kind?

13:51:54
Larry
DeeDee... thanks for the info today!

13:52:17
George H.
I will try salt then.  I have an enema bag for home enemas.

13:52:20
DaveC
Gentleness in enemas seems to be the key, as DeeDee says.

13:52:24
deedee
Thanks Larry. See you next time. I am not sure if we will have one next week so visit the website for details.

13:53:03
deedee
Great, George.  Let me know if you need any help with anything.

13:53:11
George H.
Do probiotic pills help if you have constipation?

13:53:39
derekj
They helped me.

13:54:23
deedee
Yes, probiotics are very helpful if you have constipation and even if you don't.  Make sure you take a high quality and potency.  We have a good one called Ortho Biotic on our website.  It has 20 billion CFUs.

13:54:25
derekj
You can also add the probiotic to an enema implant for a boost in good flora.

13:54:51
George H.
OK, thanks for the info.

13:54:53
deedee
We do also have a powdered probiotic by Natren that you can implant after enemas.

13:55:34
derekj
I have tried it and it works wonders.

13:56:12
deedee
Especially if you are going to be doing an enema protocol.  Good to implant after on some of them, if not all.

13:57:12
George H.
Good info.  I'll watch for your next chat.  Thanks.

13:58:00
DaveC
Bye and good health all. Will have to miss next week.

13:58:08
derekj
Thanks for the oil info for my son, DeeDee.

13:58:16
derekj
Take care everyone!

13:58:30
deedee
Thank you everyone.   Check for the date of the next one.  Derek, will you be calling me for cc details?  Now is good.

13:58:46
derekj
Yes, talk to you in a bit.

13:59:04
deedee
Great, thanks!  Goodbye everyone!
