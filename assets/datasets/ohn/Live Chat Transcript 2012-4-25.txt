Hey DeeDee. It seems like my IBS goes in cycles; diet has a lot to to with it.  Suggestions?

13:03:20
DaveC
Hi, health to all.

13:03:23
deedee
Welcome gentlemen!  How is everyone?

13:03:33
Bob L.
Doing fine here.

13:03:36
randyu
I'd like to get off of meds; and not need fiber supplements.

13:04:28
Bob L.
Just had a coffee enema treatment a couple of hours ago.

13:04:33
deedee
Randy, do you see a pattern of what foods create problems?  If you haven't already done a food journal, I would start there.  There are also some goods herbs that I could combine for you to actually heal what is going on.

13:04:50
deedee
Bob, how did that go?  Have you done them before?

13:05:11
randyu
Would the herbs react with any current meds I may take?

13:05:15
Bob L.
Oh yes, quite frequently...

13:05:22
Bob L.
Have a friend who gives a massage and coffee enema.

13:05:34
deedee
That is great Bob.  How do you feel?  

13:05:53
Bob L.
Very very tired, but totally relaxed... just woke up from nap.

13:06:30
deedee
Yes, coffee can really put you in that relaxed state.  Is there a particular reason that you do the coffee enemas?

13:06:40
Bob L.
Have been including the enema with the weekly massage treatment... and right at my home which makes it super nice.

13:07:00
Bob L.
Primarily to stay regular.

13:07:01
deedee
Randy, I would definitely cross reference the herbs that I would use with the meds you are on.

13:07:03
randyu
Is that normal for coffee to do that?

13:07:05
DaveC
Guess coffee can invigorate as well as relax? Seems that way to me. 

13:07:33
Bob L.
Yes, in the long run invigorating, but for first several hours, relaxation is prime.

13:08:04
deedee
The right kind of coffee done the correct way in the colon does usually create a relaxed state, or state of well-being.  It makes me feel calm, but yet gives me energy - a weird combination, but it works!

13:08:42
Bob L.
I have CLL... chronic lymphocytic leukemia... so sapped energy is just a way of life for me.

13:08:43
DaveC
You proved my point DeeDee, lol. 

13:08:55
deedee
Bob, how often do you do the coffee enemas?  Do you have help each time?

13:08:56
randyu
You do this every week, Bob?  

13:09:30
Bob L.
Yes, I started weekly about two months ago, and yes, a therapist gives me the massage and enema... about a three-hour treatment.

13:10:12
randyu
DeeDee, do you do the coffee enemas regularly?

13:10:28
deedee
You are very lucky to have someone to do that.  I know many people who would love to have that. There just aren't many people who do that.  Is the person a massage therapist, colon therapist, nurse?

13:11:20
randyu
Which do you get first, massage or enema?

13:11:22
Bob L.
Actually an LPN, retired.  I'm retired too.  You're right, difficult to find a good therapist who gives enemas.

13:11:35
deedee
I try to do the coffee regularly, more so when I do a cleanse quarterly, but I would love to do them more frequently if I could find the time. The therapist needs to do therapy on herself more often!

13:11:41
Bob L.
Enema, and hold as long as possible, phasing into massage.

13:12:07
DaveC
There seems difference among therapists re use of soap and coffee, but guess differences in therapies are not unusual. My experience anyway.

13:12:14
Bob L.
I do and receive a form of reiki/quantum touch massage.

13:12:14
deedee
That is great Bob - kudos to her!

13:12:20
Bob L.
Yes, for sure.

13:12:47
Bob L.
Am writing a book on energy balancing.

13:13:38
deedee
I would love to know more about your book and the topics you are covering.  Energy work is so interesting to me.  I plan on taking some classes soon on that.

13:13:41
Bob L.
I use soap along with the coffee, and salt to maintain electrolyte level.

13:14:05
Bob L.
I have been into energy balancing about 25 years.

13:14:13
deedee
What type of soap are you using?

13:14:27
deedee
Do you teach energy classes as well?

13:14:35
Bob L.
Have accumulated much much information, to compile into a book.

13:14:47
Bob L.
No, not interested in teaching a class, only one on one.

13:15:15
deedee
I would love to be better at that.

13:15:23
Bob L.
I use just soft soap... used Dr. Bronners castile for years, but with age found it a bit too stringent.

13:15:31
randyu
Can you use table salt or not?

13:16:04
Bob L.
I had an out-of-body experience in heart surgery in 1981, and came out of it with a very powerful energy field.

13:16:15
deedee
No table salt because it is just refined and bleached out sodium only.  Sea salt is unrefined and is various minerals to keep the electrolytes balanced.

13:16:16
Bob L.
I do.

13:16:26
Bob L.
I realize that.

13:16:38
Larry
Hello to everyone.  Joined late and just sitting back to see what I missed.

13:16:46
Bob L.
An out-of-body experience in that previous post.

13:16:47
deedee
Welcome Larry!

13:17:19
Bob L.
My fingers way behind my brain!

13:17:28
randyu
Sea salt available at grocery or health food store?

13:17:32
deedee
I have a good friend who is an acupuncturist.  She was in a very bad accident and is now very good at energy work and intuition.

13:18:00
Bob L.
Have had acupuncture some years ago... It's marvelous... Had a Chinese doctor doing it.

13:18:43
Bob L.
Guess I should state my age... am new with your site... I'm 79.

13:19:02
deedee
Some grocery stores carry it, but definitely health food stores, and we have a very good one that we recommend and sell on our website.

13:19:23
randyu
My IBS is more d and c and mixed.  Non-drug treatment that works?

13:19:28
deedee
Glad to have you Bob.

13:19:30
Larry
I tried it back in the late 60's  (in Taiwan) but results weren't all that positive.

13:19:41
deedee
Welcome Linda!  Good to see you on.

13:19:55
Linda E
Thank you.

13:20:01
DaveC
Bob is lucky to find therapist who'll do home therapy, and is good with enemas. Not to be found very often today.

13:20:03
Bob L.
The coffee enemas or the sea salt, Larry?

13:20:28
Larry
Acupucture!

13:21:06
Bob L.
You are right... started out with just massage, and being a nurse, more active in the years of enemas in the hospital, she was interested in administering the enemas.

13:21:07
randyu
Yes, Bob, you are lucky to find someone who gives you this good treatment at home on a regular basis.  Long life and good health to you at 79!

13:21:10
Larry
I have been helped recently by acupressure.

13:21:14
deedee
There are definite differences between acupuncturists, that is for sure.  My friend uses a lot of essential oils in her treatments which enhances the effects.  She is actually on some of our videos on the website talking about the oils.  Her name Michelle.

13:22:09
Bob L.
I find oils too stringent for my body... because of my CLL, I believe.

13:22:56
deedee
Bob, what types and brands of oils have you tried?

13:23:41
randyu
DeeDee, how do I get more info on the herbs?  What is the next step on that?  Do I take the herbs by mouth or how?

13:25:19
Bob L.
Many... Young Living and Aroma Pure essential oils.  Lavender I can handle, but some of the stronger like Thieves I can't handle.

13:25:20
Larry
I need to order more Hypothalmex when your sale pops up at the end of the month.  I ran out last week and really started to cramp up during a heavy workout this morning.  TG for the ancient minerals!  Stopped it dead!

13:25:41
deedee
Randy, we can do a little consult and then I would recommend certain herbs/mixture.  Most people take them orally, but I do have some clients who are trying them in the colon as well.  I think they seem to be working well that way also.

13:25:58
deedee
 The colon absorbs well and can be beneficial for people who do not digest well.

13:26:39
DaveC
Re sea salt, I've read detractors say that sea salt can include impurities  from its source, though it seems in wide use even in conventional foods.

13:26:48
deedee
Larry, that is great.  Sale starts tomorrow.

13:26:58
Bob L.
I do like to use the essential oils on a pendant around neck... and inhale

13:27:20
Bob L.
but an issue of oils on skin.

13:27:26
randyu
DeeDee, email you to set this up?

13:29:41
deedee
You would definitely want to get the salt from  a high-quality source that tests for impurities.

13:29:49
Larry
Will I need to call to place my order or can the Hypothalmex be ordered thru the website?

13:30:17
randyu
Shall I just call and leave a message for you, DeeDee?

13:30:48
deedee
I have to order the Hypothalmex.

13:32:55
Larry
Then, I call you tomorrow.  Timer just went off on a batch of spent brass I'm cleaning for a marathon reloading session.  Chat with you at the next session.

13:32:57
randyu
Bob, do you use just coffee or anything else?

13:33:11
Linda E
DeeDee, after an enema should minerals or other supplements be taken?

13:33:28
Bob L.
In the enemas, I assume you mean... coffee, soft soap, and salt.

13:33:47
randyu
Good question, Linda. What to take after enema treatment?

13:33:49
deedee
Yes, you can call me tomorrow, Larry.

13:34:30
randyu
Bob, do you finish with plain water then?

13:34:36
DaveC
Is lavender oil still advised for its calming effect?  It seemed to be widely used for colonic clients nervous at first treatments. Me included.

13:34:50
Bob L.
I have  favorite after-enema foods... bread, butter, loaded with peanut butter, and a 7-Up... just my thing I guess, certainly no other value.

13:35:41
Bob L.
Just go for the treatment, and you'll find no nervous reaction again.

13:36:09
deedee
Linda, you can take a probiotic, and drink some coconut water.  If you put sea salt in your enema water, this will help you to absorb those minerals and balance things out.

13:36:29
deedee
Lavender is great for relaxing.

13:36:53
Bob L.
Randy, no, I don't finish with plain water... just the coffee enema... There's an age factor working here.

13:37:10
Bob L.
I agree, DeeDee.

13:38:14
deedee
You do not have to rinse after coffee, but many people like to do a water enema several hours after the coffee one to help facilitate the removal of toxins that may have been dumped during the coffee enema.

13:38:47
Bob L.
I believe a key to an effective coffee enema is long retention... I rigged up a &quot;Y&quot; attachment device, so can hold the enema during the massage, but if need to release, am able to do so right on massage table... with no &quot;mess.&quot;

13:38:55
Linda E
Not sure I understand, if I use sea salt in the enema water, this will help absorb what minerals?

13:40:06
DaveC
Fifteen minutes with a pint of coffee seems good for me, Bob.

13:40:16
Bob L.
Years ago I used a colema board... very effective for any kind of enema.

13:42:21
randyu
Bob, the total liquid is how much?  Does this need to get high into the colon?

13:42:21
deedee
There are many minerals in sea salt and it is a good balance of minerals.  If you use 1 tsp. of sea salt per quart of water, you colon will automatically absorb that.

13:42:55
randyu
DeeDee, is that one teaspoon or tablespoon?

13:43:06
deedee
Wow Bob, you are an inventor also?!

13:43:07
Linda E
Thanks, DeeDee.

13:43:13
Bob L.
I use two quarts with the mixture mentioned earlier... but retain enema over an hour... Able to with device I hooked up.

13:43:19
Bob L.
Haha

13:43:53
deedee
Coffee should not go too high in the colon - only upper left side.

13:44:15
deedee
1 teaspoon of salt per quart.

13:44:26
Bob L.
By the way, have you ever used a stethoscope to listen to an enema being given, DeeDee, or anyone?

13:44:47
DaveC
That's my experience,  DeeDee.

13:45:06
randyu
No stethoscope here.  What do you hear?

13:45:23
deedee
Yes, I had the opportunity once with a doctor client of mine.  You sure do hear a lot of noises, don't you?  You can better tell where water is going and how much gas is in there also.

13:45:26
Bob L.
Very interesting sounds... of course particularly on left side.

13:45:44
Bob L.
Yes, absolutely, DeeDee. 

13:46:29
DaveC
Gonna have to use the stethoscope I got for a heart issue some years ago.

13:46:56
Bob L.
Yes, and you spelled it right Dave.

13:47:11
DaveC
Good guess, lol.

13:47:48
Bob L.
One of the issues of being age 79... haha.

13:48:34
deedee
Different subject, but is anyone growing a garden this summer?

13:48:55
randyu
Not here... used to... flowers around garden now.

13:49:07
Bob L.
Had to give it up... too much for my CLL.

13:50:22
Linda E
Vegetables.

13:50:52
deedee
I am going to try my hand at aeroponic gardening this year - can grow in any climate with barely any work.  Can grow all organic produce.

13:50:56
deedee
I learned about it at a seminar I was just at in Phoenix.

13:51:21
deedee
They have them set up in O'Hare airport if anyone has ever seen them there.

13:51:41
randyu
Have not been to O'hare in a while... That's different.

13:52:20
Linda E
That should be interesting.

13:52:20
deedee
The inventor has created a way for us all to have our own personal one that can sit right on a porch, deck, patio, etc.

13:52:29
DaveC
Looking to feed the family from it, if enough?

13:53:15
deedee
I will let you know my progression with my garden.  Hopefully I can post pictures of it as it grows.  It will definitely feed my family and my two turtles!

13:53:16
randyu
Yes, I agree, too much fast/junk food out there today.  Many cause health problems for many of us! Like me with IBS!

13:53:46
Linda E
Is there a website I can learn about it?

13:53:51
deedee
Yes, we just cannot seem to eat enough fruits and veggies, can we?  And the sources are not great many times.

13:53:57
Bob L.
That's great DeeDee... eat right while young!

13:54:15
randyu
Diet means so much and taking the time to prepare/eat good foods!

13:54:48
DaveC
Hubby, kids and turtles. Must work for all, lol.

13:55:09
deedee
I love growing my own herbs also - should be fun!  and no weeding which is awesome!

13:55:46
deedee
The kids will actually enjoy helping me with this garden - it is like a living science experiment!

13:55:57
randyu
Great discussion today!  I am glad to be here for it! Thanks to all for the info.

13:56:04
deedee
Does anyone have any other questions that they haven't asked yet?

13:56:18
Bob L.
One suggestion... a bit more notice, please.

13:56:33
Bob L.
Almost missed today's.

13:56:34
Linda E
Is there a website we can learn more about this type of gardening?

13:56:43
randyu
Good idea, Bob... Me too.

13:56:45
DaveC
Yes, a nice exchange. Next Wednesday look likely here?

13:56:57
Bob L.
Thank you very much.

13:57:06
randyu
Let me know the next one. Bye all...

13:57:41
randyu
Keep well...

13:58:21
deedee
I think we will have one next week.  Here is a website, Linda, to look into the gardening:  ddelkamp.towergarden.com

13:58:39
Linda E
Thank you.

13:59:15
deedee
Thank you, everyone! Sorry, we do like to give more notice, but chat depends on client needs sometimes, so sometimes it is last-minute notice - sorry about that.

13:59:29
Bob L.
Understand that.

13:59:47
randyu
I think we should have them at least twice a month...

13:59:56
deedee
Take care everyone and stay healthy!
