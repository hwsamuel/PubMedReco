 Hello Howard.  Welcome!

20:03:26
kristina
 Today we will talk about the  essential oils  and their use in the colon.

20:03:29
Dave
Hi all

20:03:48
kristina
 If you have any questions or comments, feel free to chime in at any time.

20:03:53
kristina
 welcome Dave

20:04:04
kristina
welcome Major

20:04:39
Dave
Too long between chats for me, too many time conflicts.

20:06:10
Howard
I have tried your suggestion of peppermint oils in the 2 enemas followed by a coffee enema. It is much better. Anything I can do to add the peppermint oils, say Liquid Garlic?

20:06:25
kristina
The Optimal Health Center will soon be offering a technique called Essential Oil Body Feedback.

20:07:08
kristina
 There are many different types of essential oils that can enhance a colon cleanse.

20:08:16
kristina
 Using essential oils with enemas,  rectal  implants, and colon hydrotherapy,  a person can enhance the results of their colon cleanse as well as improve their health.

20:08:36
kristina
 The Optimal Health Center has been recommending peppermint essential oil and lavender essential oil for years now with excellent results.

20:09:26
kristina
 Now we have teamed up with an acupuncturist, Michelle Buchanan, to give our customers and clients a method to test their own bodies to determine which essential oils are best for them that given day.

20:09:49
Charles N
After inserting a colon tube about 30 inches, about how much liquid can be tolerated?

20:09:54
Dave
What is proper &quot;dosage&quot; for the oils?

20:10:10
kristina
 the technique is called Essential Oil Body Feedback.

20:10:43
kristina
 You can actually test your own body using various essential oils to determine which oil is optimal for your colon cleanse and overall health.

20:11:09
kristina
 The amount of oil needed varies  depending on the oil out and the person.

20:12:02
kristina
 Charles, after inserting a colon tube about 30 inches,  a person can usually take 1 quart to 4 quarts of solution. What is your experience?

20:12:17
Howard
In the peppermint oil I use 4 drops for 4 quarts.

20:12:56
kristina
 Testing essential oils using Essential Oil Body Feedback assures appropriate oils are selected for use.  Areas of tenderness, pain, discomfort and tightness in the body correspond to health problems or potential concerns.

20:13:54
Charles N
Two quarts made holding it very difficult.

20:14:32
michael b.
hi everyone, my best wishes to my fellow chatters.

20:14:39
kristina
 These signs of discomfort, especially pain, are the body's method for communicating something is not right. Every problem in your body is recognized by your brain. Any weakness or symptom in the body, any in balance with hormones, blood sugar or emotional health, any physical trauma and any sign of accelerating gene is it knowledge to the brain. Essential Oil Body Feedback  uses the connection of the brain and the body along with therapeutic grade essential oils to tell you what your body requires to promote a fabulous colon cleanse and to promote healing.

20:14:59
kristina
 welcome Michael

20:15:38
John R
Hi all

20:15:58
kristina
 Simply put, you can identify areas of the body indicating problems or health concerns by locating areas of pain or discomfort. Then you smell essential oils and after you exhale, regress the tender area on the body to see if it is less tender, the same or worse. The body provides the feedback to let you know which essential oils promote the best healing for your individual needs.

20:16:27
kristina
 Charles, what solution were you using or do you use when you try to hold the 2 quarts of water?

20:17:08
kristina
 For cleansing the colon, we usually recommend about 1 to 3 drops of essential oil per quarter of water.

20:17:15
kristina
 Hi John

20:17:49
Charles N
One packet of the liquid soap mixed with the two quarts of water.

20:18:58
kristina
 By the time the November newsletter comes out, around Thanksgiving, we will have many more essential oils available on our website to choose from, along with information regarding which essential oils tend to provide  healing results for some people for some conditions.

20:19:08
kristina
 Charles, what type of  soap?

20:20:00
kristina
 Welcome Hanna.

20:20:07
hanna750
Hi there

20:20:36
kristina
 Essential Oil Body Feedback works because essential oils stimulate neurons in the olfactory bulb of the brain and send information to the cerebral cortex.

20:20:48
kristina
 Here connections are made with several areas of the brain that register problems and health concerns of the body.

20:20:58
Howard
Liquid Soap causes some upset and could result in the situation you said. I use peppermint oil instead.

20:21:47
kristina
 When you smell essential oils, they are temporarily affecting areas of the brain that are registering problems in the body. This effect can be measured by checking key areas of tenderness on the body.

20:22:10
kristina
 Thank you Howard.

20:23:15
Charles N
Castile soap concentrate. Maybe I should be using an essential oil instead.

20:23:20
kristina
 For those of you who have just joined us recently, I am forwarding a discussion about a technique we will be offering for using essential oils in the colon  called Essential Oil Body Feedback. However, at any point please ask any question you may have  on your mind, or comment on any  issue that is on your mind.

20:23:21
hanna750
Kristina, I have a question about coffee enemas.

20:23:36
kristina
 Excellent Hanna. Please go ahead and ask.

20:24:22
hanna750
I have lyme disease and every time I do a coffee enema I feel bad 2 hrs later.  Could it be that it circulates toxins?

20:25:09
kristina
  With my work with the acupuncturist Michelle  Buchanan, I have learned that it is important to test your essential oils that you use in your colon. It seems that it is best to rotate your essential oils similar to rotating foods in your diet.

20:26:59
kristina
 Hanna,  can you please tell me more? Do you clear out the colon before you take a coffee enema? How often do you take a coffee enema? How much coffee do you use? How long have you been taking the coffee enemas? When you say I feel bad, what exactly do you mean? How do you feel  badly?

20:28:15
hanna750
Yes, I do a water enema first and then the coffee and retain it for 15 min.  I've been doing them for 2 yrs now.  I do add a tsp of celtic salt to it.

20:29:00
kristina
 Have you tried taking a second  enema after the first  enema and before the coffee enema?

20:29:06
John R
Kristina, what do you recommend to sanitize enema equipment?

20:29:15
kristina
 How long have you been feeling badly two hours after you take your coffee enema?

20:30:11
hanna750
Almost every time i do it if feel bad.

20:30:15
michael b.
The Young Living essential oils that DeeDee, your assistant, recommended was most amazing. Oh, DeeDee did a splendid job  of filling in for you at last chat.

20:31:38
kristina
 First clean your enema equipment  using hot soapy water; then soak your enema equipment in some hot water and grapefruit seed extract; then dry your enema equipment well. After each stage, eye your  equipment to make sure you do not see any  contamination on it.

20:32:17
kristina
 Thanks for letting me know that, Michael. Have you tried using the Young Living essential oils? If so, what did you do?

20:32:38
kristina
 For two entire years you  have been feeling bad two hours after you take a coffee enema, Hanna?

20:32:52
kristina
 How long does this bad feeling last?

20:33:06
John R
Thank you Kristina. I will look for the grapefruit seed extract on your website.

20:33:17
Charles N
Kristina, essential oil rather than castile soap?

20:33:21
kristina
 You're welcome, John.

20:34:03
Dave
 Another suppliment: magnesium. How does it enhance colon health, and is it good for all ages? Dosage?

20:34:13
kristina
 Yes, Charles. Many people have excellent cleansing results with a better therapeutic action when they use essential oils in the colon  instead of soap.

20:34:33
Charles N
Thanks.

20:35:56
hanna750
Yes, but remember I do have lyme disease which when killing the bacteria you get toxins.  The coffee enema does make me feel worse but maybe it's detoxing.  I wish it would make me feel better.  I guess my question is: could it be circulating the toxins?

20:36:13
Joseph
Hi Kris - just wanted to say I bought the 32fr 30 inch colon tube from you and I love it.

20:37:09
kristina
 That's a good question, Dave. Magnesium is an essential mineral for colon health.  Yes, it is important for all ages. For dosage, may I recommend a hair tissue mineral  analysis to determine your individual needs for magnesium.

20:37:47
kristina
 Hello Joseph!  Thanks for the update. It would be great to hear what we love about it.

20:40:27
Joseph
Well, I like that it is silicone, and I feel safe with that. It was way less intimidating than I imagined once I saw the small package, and I got about 18&quot; in the first time (only used it once so far), and I could take the 2 quarts very easily.

20:40:30
kristina
 Magnesium, besides being an essential mineral for regular bowel movements, is present in most cells and plays an essential role as the cofactor, assisting enzymes and catalyzing many necessary chemical reactions. Magnesium functions in reactive processes, such as nerve conduction, muscular movement, bone metabolism, protein synthesis, fat and carbohydrate metabolism, and glucose utilization.

20:41:52
kristina
Thanks, Joseph.

20:42:49
Joseph
You are welcome... so now I know when I take a coffee retention that the fluid will get where it needs to be.

20:43:59
Dave
Magnesium sounds valuable. Good in maintaining regularity?

20:44:09
kristina
 Yes, the coffee enema could be circulating the toxin. I have an article on my website about using  the toxin binder chlorella.

20:45:26
hanna750
I actually have chlorella at home.  How many hours before the enema should I take it?

20:46:14
kristina
 I would also make sure that it is the coffee enema that's causing the problem. I would do an enema series without using the coffee implant to see if you have the same results. I would also vary the amount of coffee that you use,  vary the water source that you use,  vary the stimulant that you use, etc. With the method, biofeedback method,  that we are soon to have on our website, you can learn how to test all of these factors to determine which choices are best for you on a given day.

20:46:31
michael b.
Young Living is most amazing. They are just nuts about thieves. They offer household cleaners with oil of thieves, foaming hand soap, and more oils than I could imagine. Also diffusers, thinking it is most wonderful to have the scent of oils in your daily life.

20:47:30
kristina
 Chlorella binds toxins tightly. Once coffee stimulates your gallbladder to contract and release toxin-laden bile into the small intestine, you want something where the bile duct enters  the intestine to bind the toxins so tightly they will not be read and sort through the intestinal wall.

20:48:13
kristina
 What this means is that you take a handful of chlorella tablets, 15 to 30 tablets, timed to precede the start of the enema by about 30 minutes.

20:48:41
kristina
 Just before starting the enema,  take an additional handful of chlorella tablets - about 5 to 15 tablets.

20:50:02
kristina
 The dosage,  generally,  for magnesium supplementation is between 400  and 1000 mg per day.

20:50:13
kristina
 Once a person takes too much magnesium, they will get diarrhea.

20:52:02
Dave
Thanks. We don't want the opposite effect!

20:52:05
hanna750
I'm going to try this next time I do the enema.  

20:52:20
kristina
 The reason I recommend the hair tissue mineral analysis to determine how much magnesium you need, even though the body has a bowel tolerance for it, is because it is crucial for magnesium to be in the proper ratio to calcium, potassium, and sodium. It is the ratio of these four minerals that is one of the cornerstones to good health. This is because these are the main minerals used for cellular respiration. These are the main four minerals - potassium, calcium, magnesium, sodium - that  assist the body, each and every cell, to take in nutrients and to release waste.

20:52:57
hanna750
I feel it detoxing my liver.  I don't have a gallbladder, but I'm assuming it detoxes the liver.  

20:54:49
kristina
 The ratio of these minerals also plays a central role in thyroid health and adrenal health, thus your capacity to  adapt well to stress(age).

20:55:13
kristina
 Yes, the coffee enema does detoxify the liver.

20:55:44
kristina
 Hanna,  let us know how it goes please.

20:56:11
kristina
 We have about five minutes left. Have I missed anything? Does anyone have anything else they want to talk about?

20:56:19
michael b.
Have trace minerals become available yet? Can I order such from DeeDee?

20:56:34
hanna750
I will ask one more question... I usually lie on my right but doesn't it make sense to lie on the left side?

20:58:03
Joseph
Thank you Kris!  Take care.

20:58:10
Howard
No you should lay on your left side.

20:58:24
michael b.
Don't forget to get Arlo a bone now and then.

20:58:28
kristina
 I usually recommend that people lie on their backs  while doing their enema. However, if one is going to lie on their side, I recommend that you start out on your left side and once all the solution is in the colon,  move on to your right side, slowly, using your back.

20:59:16
hanna750
Thank you so much kristina....I will let u know how it goes next time I do an enema.  Have a good evening.

20:59:24
John R
Kristina, thanks for all the great information. Have an awesome night.

20:59:43
Howard
Happy Thanksgiving

20:59:46
Dave
Thanks, good night.

21:00:05
John R
Happy Thanksgiving, Kristina.

21:00:26
kristina
 Michael, because they been focusing on the essential oils, we are delayed in offering the minerals and the grape seed extract. However, if you call DeeDee and tell her to get together with me  to send you a care package, I will make sure that happens within the next week. You let her know I said this. Also, because I had to move into an apartment building, Arlo has a new home and I have two adorable kittens.

21:00:43
kristina
 You are welcome John. You have an awesome night too.

21:00:59
kristina
 Happy Thanksgiving everyone.

21:01:04
kristina
 You are welcome, Hanna.

21:01:18

I have had a cat for 18 years. They say a cat reduces the chance of a heart attack.

21:08:33
