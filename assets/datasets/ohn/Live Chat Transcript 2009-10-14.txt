Jay J
Well this is my first chat - what is the protocol?

20:02:44&nbsp;
Dave
Kristina invites questions, may bring up a topic herself.

20:02:52&nbsp;
kristina
Welcome. Please begin with your questions or comments.

20:03:17&nbsp;
Jay J
Can a person get addicted to enemas?

20:03:49&nbsp;
kristina
Yes and no. Can you be more specific?

20:04:19&nbsp;
Jay J
Say, every day have one

20:04:20&nbsp;
TomE
How's the new 4 qt stainless enema bucket working out?

20:05:40&nbsp;
kristina
Everyday use is not a sign of an addiction. more info on safely using enemas

20:06:19&nbsp;
Jay J
Good, I will follow up on that. Thanks.

20:06:33&nbsp;
kristina
People love the 4 qt stainless steel buckets. They're sturdy, well-made, and locally manufactured.

20:09:55&nbsp;
TomE
Is there a difference in sea salt qualities?

20:10:53&nbsp;
Jay J
All I know is that some brands offer two types: a fine and a coarse.

20:11:19&nbsp;
TomE
Is 1 tbsp per quart the right amount?

20:11:21&nbsp;
kristina
That is a good question. Certainly the manufacturers of the products say that there is. I have found that Celtic Sea salt works well and it doesn't irritate the colon at all, which isn't true about other salt brands.

20:12:09&nbsp;
michael b
Kristina, a most happy August to you and the rest of the fellow chatters.

20:12:45&nbsp;
Jay J
Which has a better calming effect - peppermint oil or lavender oil?

20:13:00&nbsp;
kristina
Both the fine and the coarse will dissolve equally well in warm water.

20:13:29&nbsp;
kristina
October, yikes!

20:13:52&nbsp;
Dave
Snow time for Madison!

20:14:20&nbsp;
Carl E
What could be possible reasons for not being able to take more than a 2 or 3 cup enema?

20:14:32&nbsp;
TomE
Snow time in Iowa as well

20:14:33&nbsp;
kristina
Yeah, it actually snowed last Saturday, but it all melted quickly

20:14:58&nbsp;
kristina
Lavender has a better calming effect.

20:15:05&nbsp;
TomE
do you use warm water?

20:15:34&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, always.

20:15:39&nbsp;
Jay J
Are there any remedies that are targeted for type II diabetics?

20:16:57&nbsp;
TomE
2 or 3 cups is a very small amount. have you ever tried the flowmaster system?

20:17:11&nbsp;
kristina
how to take enemas

20:18:15&nbsp;
Carl E
No. I was thinking of trying the 750ML double balloon nozzle. Would the flowmaster system be better?

20:18:27&nbsp;
TomE
OHN has a very good DVD on it as well

20:18:29&nbsp;
kristina
This [downloadable booklet] information, along with our two downloadable videos, Small and Large Volume Enemas, give the most in-depth picture on taking 2-4 quarts of enema solution into the colon.

20:18:55&nbsp;
kristina
do you take the water in slowly, even as slowly as 1/4 cup every minute or so?

20:19:02&nbsp;
kristina
Adding sea salt often helps.

20:19:36&nbsp;
Carl E
I think even slower than that. 

20:19:56&nbsp;
TomE
the flowmaster allows slow control pressure and flow to all slow filling. the nozzle can be any type

20:20:12&nbsp;
Carl E
I have used Celtic sea salt too. Same results.

20:20:13&nbsp;
Dave
Taking it too fast may be the volume problem. Some of us had to learn to slow down.

20:20:16&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, the Flowmaster or the in-line pump helps to move the water past the anal and sigmoid areas of the colon.

20:21:09&nbsp;
kristina
diabetes solutions

20:21:12&nbsp;
Carl E
So you would recommend the Flowmaster over the double balloon nozzle?

20:21:32&nbsp;
Jay J
Excellent - Thank you

20:21:34&nbsp;
michael b
the sept. newsletter really caught my interest, having lived in the Plumas National Forest for 12 years, with the main source of heat an air-tight wood stove, I had never heard of benzene problems. maybe i should consider the detox you mentioned?

20:21:47&nbsp;
kristina
Generally, one needs small meals often

20:22:00&nbsp;
kristina
Small amounts of protein and fat with each meal.

20:22:32&nbsp;
TomE
The double bulb is a lot of nozzle.  the basic inflation nozzle or colon tube is what I find more useful.

20:23:23&nbsp;
kristina
Also, eat only 20 or less grams of carbohydrates per meal.

20:23:47&nbsp;
kristina
That is an excellent idea, Michael.

20:24:07&nbsp;
kristina
Researching the benzene article taught me a lot. I was particularly shocked that people who excercise store more benzene than those who don't.

20:28:01&nbsp;
kristina
The smooth flow syringes actually move water deeper into the colon, past the section of the colon that has the most nerve endings.

20:28:59&nbsp;
TomE
slow filling with water at 103F with sea salt works well. if you use peppermint oil or soap, that can cause me early expelling with low  volume.

20:29:20&nbsp;
kristina
In this way, you don't stimulate the nerves that cause the cramping or need to evacuate.

20:29:40&nbsp;
Dave
A colon tube best in that case?

20:30:06&nbsp;
kristina
All of our retention nozzles allow for a hands-free enema experience and can make it easier to take in more water. 

20:30:41&nbsp;
kristina
They also help if leaking is an issue.

20:30:52&nbsp;
Carl E
OK. I had an enema series in Madison last month. Dee Dee used a colon tube. I could only hold about 2 cups then also.

20:31:18&nbsp;
kristina
However, they too put pressure on that same area of the colon, so sometimes they can make it more difficult to take in 2-4 quarts of enema solution.

20:31:53&nbsp;
kristina
enema retention inflatable nozzles

20:32:37&nbsp;
TomE
slow filling and relaxing is best. sometimes it just takes practice.

20:34:13&nbsp;
kristina
Thanks, Tom.

20:34:15&nbsp;
Jay J
My preference is a warm bubble bath and a double ballon with a very slow flow.

20:34:25&nbsp;
Carl E
I guess I'll just have to keep trying. I was planning to try double ballon nozzle next, but maybe the flowmaster would be better.

20:34:42&nbsp;
kristina
I love it when people respond to issues brought up here with their own experiences.

20:35:09&nbsp;
Dave
What's the best insertion length of colon tube to accept more solution?

20:35:50&nbsp;
michael b
Kristina, that was a long reference to benzene. thanks. i will read it later.

20:36:08&nbsp;
kristina
Colon tubes, when inserted deeply enough, do deliver the water beyond the sigmoid colon.

20:36:49&nbsp;
kristina
colon tubes

20:37:08&nbsp;
kristina
8-20 inches, depending on the individual.

20:38:00&nbsp;
Dave
Best done by a &quot;giver&quot; I guess?

20:38:06&nbsp;
TomE
I vary between 10&quot; up to 20&quot; but needs patience and practice.  Once past 6&quot; nerve sensations go away.

20:38:07&nbsp;
kristina
Carl, what happens after you get the 2 cups into the colon? Do you have pain or just an urge to release or do you start to leak?

20:38:48&nbsp;
Carl E
I have an urge to release and I sometimes leak.

20:39:11&nbsp;
kristina
Have you tried putting the water in VERY slowly?

20:39:18&nbsp;
kristina
Have you used the sea salt?

20:39:43&nbsp;
kristina
sea salt

20:40:02&nbsp;
Carl E
Yes, I have used sea salt very slowly.

20:40:20&nbsp;
kristina
For those with leaking as the main issue with taking in more water, the double balloon nozzle is an excellent tool.

20:41:49&nbsp;
kristina
For those of you who haven't joined us on Facebook yet, please do.

20:42:02&nbsp;
Carl E
Can the double balloon be used without a giver?

20:42:13&nbsp;
kristina
Then you don't have to wait 2-4 weeks to chat. I also have DeeDee on there, too.

20:42:30&nbsp;
michael b
question: the juice, 90% celery, 10% cilantro, no other type juice, 8oz. i guess i am lucky i have a juicer.

20:42:37&nbsp;
TomE
Yes with practice the double can be done solo

20:43:02&nbsp;
TomE
Don't over inflate it 

20:43:05&nbsp;
kristina
In this way, we can support each other more fully with colon cleansing, fasting, taking enemas, dietary changes, getting through the flu season and more!

20:43:33&nbsp;
Carl E
Thanks, TomE.

20:43:47&nbsp;
kristina
Make sure to use those two vegetables. If you want to have a bit of variety, do add carrot or beet or ginger.

20:44:53&nbsp;
Dave
Does OHN see more clients at flu season for prevention?

20:45:10&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, the double balloon is easily used by oneself. Also, it is currently on sale.

20:45:59&nbsp;
michael b
with the big push for flu shots, can one ask, leave out the mercury and the anti-freeze?

20:46:43&nbsp;
kristina
We are very busy this time of the year. We slow down between Thanksgiving and Christmas and then we are very busy again in January.

20:47:16&nbsp;
kristina
Check out my home page. I have written about this very issue. There is more than one way to avoid getting H1N1.

20:48:07&nbsp;
michael b
i am just not nice or should i say not PC. please tell us more.

20:48:59&nbsp;
Dave
My local therapist took her own medicine - 3 colonics in 5 days - for flu-like and respiratory symptoms and bounced back, with bed rest, etc too. 

20:49:28&nbsp;
kristina
Unfortunately, one can't leave out the toxins from the Swine Flu.

20:51:49&nbsp;
kristina
Here is an article to read about the Swine Flu vaccination

20:53:40&nbsp;
kristina
there is already overwhelming evidence showing that your vitamin D levels play a significant role in your likelihood of getting the flu

20:53:56&nbsp;
kristina
Have your vitamin D levels tested as your first step in optimizing your health.

20:54:22&nbsp;
kristina
I, who love being out in the sun as much as I possible can, have been low on Vitamin D.

20:54:34&nbsp;
michael b
as a child, i got shots for polio, small pox, 12 combined stuff in shots, if iwas going to vietnam, but did not go there. so i sometimes wonder how  resistant I am?

20:54:40&nbsp;
kristina
I have people start by taking 10,000 IUs.

20:55:05&nbsp;
kristina
vitamin D

20:55:41&nbsp;
kristina
Thanks for sharing that story, Dave.

20:55:57&nbsp;
kristina
Did she think she had the Swine flu or the seasonal flu?

20:56:27&nbsp;
kristina
Next live chat is at noon on Wednesday, October 28th.

20:56:49&nbsp;
michael b
did the dog whisperer tell arlo to carry a small can of bug spray?

20:56:50&nbsp;
kristina
For those of you who don't already have a Facebook page, it is easier to navigate than being on this Live Chat!

20:56:56&nbsp;
TomE
facebook info?

20:57:11&nbsp;
kristina
Laugh out loud (lol), Michael.

20:57:19&nbsp;
Dave
Probably seasonal. Swine's still very spotty around thecountry and among age groups I guess.

20:57:54&nbsp;
kristina
Arlo is still struggling with his wasp experience as every little bug that touches his body after that experience has made him nervous. 

20:58:18&nbsp;
kristina
I think, with the cold weather, he is slowly coming back to his regular self.

20:59:11&nbsp;
kristina
There is a link on the home page now to Facebook.

20:59:27&nbsp;
TomE
thanks

20:59:32&nbsp;
kristina
thanks all for joining me here tonight! I will look forward to our next chance to interact.

20:59:41&nbsp;
kristina
Bye now.

20:59:45&nbsp;
michael b
a good winter coat of fur will make arlo feel better.

20:59:58&nbsp;
Dave
Bye

21:00:03&nbsp;
TomE
