Hello Dave!

13:02:01
Dave
Hi

13:02:08
deedee
Hello Randy

13:02:32
deedee
Please, anyone jump in with any questions or comments.  

13:03:09
deedee
I will let you all know of some things I have been recently working with, with implants, but want to address any of your concerns or questions

13:03:15
deedee
Hi Michael

13:03:19
randyu
Randy here

13:04:20
deedee
I think we have talked about this in the past... but I have been working on implants for healing and I am having great success with them so far.

13:04:52
Dave
Interesting thing in today's local paper: 4 page section on colorectal cancer. Might this be on the increase? Didn't hear much mention back when enemas and other colon care was routine. 

13:04:54
randyu
Can I ask a question that pertains only to me?

13:05:39
michael b.
Happy spring - here is hoping great health to all here.

13:05:48
deedee
They make so much sense to me, to deliver the healing oil/herb right into the colon since there is such  great absorption there, especially for those that have digestive issues and/or have a hard time taking things orally.

13:05:50
randyu
My question is about that, Dave.

13:06:29
Dave
Yes, a good one.

13:06:55
deedee
Dave, I think you are right.  Colon cancer is probably on the rise due to the increase in our poor diets and people being told it is OK if you only go to the bathroom every third day

13:07:08
deedee
Randy, you can ask any question you want.

13:08:40
deedee
Recently a client sent me an e-mail regarding an interview she saw between Suzanne Somers and Dr. Nancy Snyderman, who is on the NBC Today Show a lot as their medical specialist.

13:08:42
randyu
I have IBS and on other meds which can cause constipation. I have not taken or had even a warm water enema in years.  Do I need to see a doctor or can I do this myself?  

13:09:28
Dave
Yes, there was more attention paid to proper elimination, whether when well and especially when  ill. Then it became enema time. 

13:10:45
deedee
There was also Dr. Nicholas Gonzalez who says he recommends to his cancer patients to take a couple of coffee enemas per day  -  that is great they are talking about this on TV.

13:11:57
deedee
Randy, you can definitely do enemas yourself at home and I can walk you through getting equipment so you are comfortable.  We also have great DVDs that show you exactly how to do an enema at home.

13:12:31
Dave
People are starting to look at alternatives, which ironically was standard operating procedure years ago.

13:12:49
deedee
Randy, I can also help you to come off of medication and to heal that IBS.

13:13:24
randyu
Yes, DeeDee, what about proper equipment?  Should I have someone else help give the enema to me? I have not had one in many years.

13:13:42
deedee
Yes, people are finally starting to talk about alternative health practices. (We say alternative, but they were so mainstream so many years ago.)

13:14:31
deedee
Randy, if you have someone willing to give the enema to you, that is great, and can be relaxing, but if you don't, you can definitely do it yourself with a little practice.

13:15:00
deedee
Randy, you can call me here at the center, and I will help you pick out enema equipment.

13:15:34
deedee
Has anyone here done suppositories in the past?

13:15:51
Dave
Yes, sight of a bag or enema can stored  on a bathroom door was almost routine.

13:16:03
deedee
I have a great new healing way to do suppositories.

13:16:06
randyu
Yes I would like to come off meds. I will give a call, DeeDee. 

13:16:32
deedee
Great, Randy. Look forward to talking with you.

13:17:35
randyu
Suppositories work, but glycerin has side effects.

13:17:52
randyu
DeeDee, when is a good time to call you?

13:17:56
deedee
I have done these healing suppositories on myself and have been giving others the recipes and oils/herbs to do them and, wow!  do they work nicely. I should have testimonials about them soon.

13:18:07
deedee
Even though this is not a new concept, the way I am starting to recommend them is new to most people.

13:18:24
michael b.
People are getting away from &quot;take 2 asprin and call me in the morning.&quot;

13:18:57
deedee
Randy, I am with clients throughout the day, so just try to call and leave me a message if I don't answer and I will return your call asap.

13:19:41
deedee
I use all natural unrefined organic coconut oil for my suppositories, along with essential oils/herbs.  No glycerin.

13:20:33
deedee
Right, Michael - though there is a way to take aspirin in the colon for pain also. 

13:20:57
Dave
Do the suppositrie melt fast for absorption, and should an enema precede it?

13:21:41
deedee
Aspirin is willow tree bark.

13:22:11
randyu
Suppositories don't clean, just relieve. Enemas do both and work faster and better, right?

13:23:10
deedee
Dave, yes, they do melt quickly, they are very easy to insert, and you should do them in evening when you can lie down until you know how your body will react to them (we don't want embarrassing oil leaking). You should be cleaned out first if possible.

13:24:00
deedee
Enemas do work much better than the normal suppository. I am using suppositories for healing purposes, not eliminating purposes.

13:25:28
Dave
Can't ever recall getting a suppository, just a soap stick once as a child that was followed by an enema anyway. 

13:25:37
randyu
How much water is the norm for adults?  One quart at a time?

13:25:43
deedee
These suppositories deliver healing oils/herbs into the body so we can directly heal hemorrhoids,  fissures, IBS, prostate issues, etc.

13:26:21
Dave
Do you manufacture the suppository at OHN?

13:27:35
deedee
Randy, many people work up to 3 - 4 quart enemas for a high enema and thorough cleanse.

13:28:38
randyu
For a lower bowel cleanse only, about a quart for that?

13:28:55
deedee
Dave, I make the oil/herb combinations here and put them in a bottle, and give instructions on how people can make the suppositories at home - they are very easy.

13:29:09
deedee
Unfortunately it would be hard to ship the coconut oil as a suppository because it would melt above 76 degrees.

13:29:33
deedee
I make them up here though for clients wanting to have one after their session with me.

13:29:39
Dave
I assume absorption is quick.

13:30:16
Dave
Sounds good.

13:30:23
deedee
I use a rounded (smaller) ice cube tray and about 1 tablespoon of melted coconut oil per suppository  -  add your oils/herbs to this and cool until firm.

13:30:56
deedee
Randy, 1 - 2 quarts for a lower bowel cleanse is fine.

13:31:23
deedee
Randy, we also recommend a series of enemas here (3) that gets the colon very cleaned out.

13:31:46
Dave
I think vintage enema cans and bags were 2 quarts/liters. Bags seem smaller now.

13:32:48
deedee
Our smallest enema bag/bucket

13:33:12
deedee
 is 1 1/2 quarts.

13:33:36
randyu
What if in my case I have not been cleansed in a couple of years?  For constipation, just one enema about 2 quarts?

13:33:44
deedee
Randy, what got you interested in looking into enemas?  Have you been on our websites yet?

13:34:52
deedee
The two quart enema will be a temporary fix, but to really get cleaned out, we recommend the series and for that to be done several days or weeks depending on the issues.

13:35:44
Dave
Randy, have you considered looking for a colonic?

13:36:29
deedee
You don't have to do enemas consecutive days, but do several or have someone perform a colonic to get you started if you can find that in your area.  If not, no worries, it can be done at home.

13:37:21
deedee
It is a cold day here in Wisconsin.  How is it by you all?

13:37:33
randyu
Yes I saw the website; I have IBS, on meds, and have constipation, so the enema seems like the next logical step.  No, I did not look for colonic.

13:37:44
randyu
Cold, snowy here... icy... winter.

13:38:11
Dave
There seems to be relatively little institutional memory about home enemas, but colonics seem to be making a comeback.

13:38:27
randyu
I do take benefiber or fiber tabs and stool softener now and then, fiber daily.

13:38:41
deedee
Randy, I can definitely get you started on the road to healing  -  these are very common problems that a lot of people seem to have.

13:39:32
randyu
Yes, common but embarassing to talk about with someone, even doctor or nurse.

13:40:02
deedee
Dave, yes, colonics are becoming more popular, but we are trying to bring back the enema for in home, because of the economy, etc.,  people may not be able to have as many colonics as they should.

13:40:32
randyu
My memory tells me that the cleansing enema way back now and then made me feel better and more alive... open.

13:40:51
deedee
Randy, you definitely do not have to feel embarassed talking to me. I think I've heard everything!!  Many times!!

13:42:15
deedee
Some people cannot even find a colon therapist in their state. I wonder why we are so rare?

13:42:17
randyu
The IBS thing makes it difficult to travel... We eat and can't go, etc., then it all comes out at once, then starts over.  Have to break the cycle.... DeeDee, thanks for the kind works...

13:42:20
Dave
During the Great Depression and WWII, the home enema was alive and well. I know. 

13:42:45
deedee
You're welcome, Randy.

13:42:47
Dave
MDs were fine with them.

13:42:56
michael b.
It is now spring? More snow storms on the lineup. Last weekend I -80 was totally closed, one 40-car pileup.

13:43:01
randyu
Yes, enemas were popular then......

13:43:20
deedee
You are right, Dave, people had to do their own health care.  We are getting back to that little by little, I think.

13:43:36
randyu
Yes, I am near route 80 in PA near Poconos... Bad travel today. Glad I am home.

13:44:13
deedee
You guys are supposed to have that kind of weather. That is Wisconsin weather.

13:44:26
randyu
DeeDee, how long will you have to talk with me when I call?

13:44:53
randyu
Go Packers... Love Green Bay and cheese - cheese steaks

13:44:59
michael b.
This was Reno to  Sacramento.

13:45:05
deedee
A meat truck caught on fire yesterday on I-94 (the way I come in to work).  People had to wait 1 1/2 hours to get through  - glad I took an earlier exit!

13:46:17
deedee
Randy, I can talk briefly with you about general things unless we set up a specific appointment (consult) which is $ 1.40 per minute. I cannot make specific recommendations unless we do that and I have a health intake form from you.

13:46:46
deedee
We can talk about the kinds of equipment needed without an appointment though.

13:47:09
michael b.
No snacks while everyone waited for the fire dept.

13:47:11
randyu
OK, that is good enough for now. Thanks, DeeDee...

13:47:22
Dave
Randy, DeeDee is a very understanding person.

13:47:37
deedee
Randy, that stuff tastes good but not so good on the colon!

13:47:51
randyu
Yes, she sounds great, thanks.

13:48:18
deedee
Thank you for the wonderful compliments  - I appreciate them!

13:49:11
Dave
Looking forward to the Midwest, once winter finally ends.

13:49:19
deedee
It would be great to see you all if you would take a road trip here sometime!

13:49:36
randyu
Been to Wisconsin, but not Madison.

13:49:52
deedee
Did any of you get the flu bug this year?

13:50:00
randyu
No - lucky...

13:50:43
randyu
DeeDee, do I use the number posted on the website? That is the main contact?

13:50:58
deedee
I got a little something (and I never really get sick anymore), but it went away a lot faster for me than other people.   Cleansing can really get you through that.

13:51:36
deedee
Madison is great!   The office number is 608-242-0200  or you can e-mail me at  deedee@[ourdomain].com.

13:51:57
Dave
Escaped it, but bunch of meds I'm taking mean more colon attention.

13:52:25
deedee
Yes, medication is hard on the liver and colon.  Cleansing is very beneficial for that.

13:53:02
Dave
With mild flu: a colonic or just an enema or two?

13:53:33
deedee
Dave, either is good.

13:54:33
randyu
Enemas work for the flu, too?  Meds work but hard on the system, side effects, etc.

13:54:49
deedee
I am looking forward to preparing some antimicrobial, antifungal, antibacterial suppositories for next year's flu season!

13:54:53
Dave
My childhood enemas usually were connected with a bug. Standard advice then. Not alone I'm sure.

13:55:15
randyu
No, not at all...

13:55:33
Dave
Randy, your mom gave them?

13:55:49
randyu
Yes, how did you know that?

13:56:28
michael b.
I have been without flu for awhile. I keep following the diet changes and colon cleansing Kristina suggested starting 5 years ago. Must be doing right.

13:56:42
deedee
Yes, enemas/colonics flush the &quot;bad stuff&quot; out more quickly and make the liver and other organs more able to deal with detoxifying the body.  It also boosts the immune system.

13:57:18
Dave
Randy, when you said &quot;not at all&quot;...

13:57:34
randyu
Yes, that's why I don't know why we got away from them, now making a comeback....

13:58:01
Dave
... a  love/hate thing at the time?

13:58:19
randyu
Yes.

13:58:42
deedee
If you guys are all around the same age, it seems that it was a time that mothers, etc., gave them to their kids.  Some households never practiced them for some reason though.

13:58:52
Dave
It was bittersweet for many.

13:59:39
deedee
Kids of course do not like to be given them, so many people have that bad memory.  Then they start again as adults and really find the benefits.

13:59:47
Dave
Yes, , it was common but not 100 percent in families.

13:59:48
randyu
Yes, they were used to cool high fever, too, worked well, and to help relieve constipation.

14:00:47
deedee
Yes, the many benefits of a good cleanse  -  and now we can explore even more benefits with them by looking into how we can use implanting for healing  - all very exciting to me!

14:00:49
randyu
Hospitals still use them.

14:01:22
deedee
Yes, sometimes they do, but they are mostly unpleasant at the hospital.

14:01:37
randyu
Yes and I don't know why.

14:01:44
deedee
Randy, if you got a cleanse from me, you would feel like you were at a spa.

14:02:42
deedee
They give them too quickly and many times with chemicals/additives that create cramping.

14:03:21
randyu
Maybe I should take a vacation in Madison?

14:04:00
deedee
Yes Randy, that would be great.                                                         Well, it is that time again to wrap it up.  The time goes so quickly! I appreciate the wonderful discussion and feedback.  

14:04:30
randyu
DeeDee, you are right, having someone else do the cleanse is better...

14:04:53
deedee
You all have a very nice rest of your week and stay warm and well.

14:05:13
randyu
DeeDee, I emailed you and will call you soon.

14:05:22
randyu
Thanks for everything... Bye.

14:05:41
deedee
I will look forward to hearing from you all again soon.   Thank you!

14:05:50
michael b.
It is great to make these chats, always learning new stuff.

14:06:01
randyu
:) 

14:06:33
deedee
Glad to have you all - I also learn from all of you :) :) 

14:06:38
michael b.
Take care, tell Kristina hello.

14:06:47
deedee
Will do - thanks.
