Also, hi Ghung and Major!

18:04:13&nbsp;
Carol45
I am trying to get back to my routine.  I have some questions about supplements.

18:04:23&nbsp;
kristina
Might you all introduce yourselves so I can get to know you better?

18:04:28&nbsp;
Tim
thanks for the reminder by e-mail...

18:04:48&nbsp;

Great, go ahead with the questions. And, if you feel like typing it out, I am sure that people are interested in exactly what your routine is.

18:04:59&nbsp;

Evening all - looking for suggestions for a nozzle to use while taking enemas

18:06:24&nbsp;
major
in a sitting position

18:06:36&nbsp;
Tim
After the first enema, you always say it is important to rinse: I have a hard time expelling the second enema - is there a reason for this?

18:07:25&nbsp;
kristina
Major, have you tried any nozzles yet? How do they work?

18:07:29&nbsp;
Carol45
It is basically the 10-day diet, with eating every 2 hours.  Small amounts of protein and orange juice or vegetables.  It does keep my blood sugar more stable.  Also I've gotten quite fond of 3/4 cup warm celtic sea salt water

18:07:35&nbsp;
Carol45
with 1 tablespoon of coconut oil added.

18:08:23&nbsp;
major
basic nozzle - is larger better?

18:08:45&nbsp;
Lisa
Has anyone ever tried the curved nozzle? If so, are they any good? I may buy one.

18:08:46&nbsp;
Carol45
First thing in the morning can I take Vita-Gest and Primal Defense together, or should I wait 10 or 15 minutes between?

18:08:56&nbsp;
kristina
The nozzle that comes to my mind immediately that is easy to use and stays in the colon is the Flexible Inflatable Nozzle.

18:09:34&nbsp;
major
Thanks - will check it out!

18:09:44&nbsp;
kristina
An enema nozzle that doesn't fall out while you cleanse the colon is the best nozzle to use.

18:09:48&nbsp;
Joseph
Hello all, I finally made it in!  :p 

18:09:59&nbsp;
kristina
Welcome, Joseph. Please do introduce yourself.

18:10:18&nbsp;
kristina
Can you give the name of the nozzle, Lisa?

18:10:24&nbsp;
Joseph
Joseph is my name, I am a 40 y/o male in Chicago

18:10:51&nbsp;
Carol45
I bought myself a Christmas present and got the white #2 nozzle.  With my external and internal hemorrhoids it works very well, as does the silicone tube.

18:11:06&nbsp;
kristina
What is your interest in this chat about enemas, detox diets, the colon cleanse, enema equipment?

18:11:28&nbsp;
LoneEagle
Hello all

18:11:31&nbsp;
Lisa
I don't know what it's called, but I can find out. It seems with the nozzle curved slightly, it may stay in better.

18:11:38&nbsp;
Joseph
Well, I visited a few months ago, and haven't been able to get in again until now

18:11:40&nbsp;
Tim
Kristina, did you get my question?

18:11:47&nbsp;
Joseph
hi LoneEagle

18:12:03&nbsp;
kristina
An FYI about the silicone colon tube: I have just ordered the 70 durometer colon tube, which will be available in February, for those of you who had been looking for a stiffer colon tube.

18:12:11&nbsp;
kristina
Tim, I don't think so, sorry.

18:12:16&nbsp;
kristina
Thanks for asking, too!

18:12:56&nbsp;
LoneEagle
Is there a theme or topic for this chat?

18:13:00&nbsp;
Tim
I am having trouble on the second enema rinsing: will not expel - is there a reason for this?

18:13:09&nbsp;
kristina
Over the years, I have had many reports that the delrin nozzles do offer an added level of therapy for those who have anal fissures and/or hemorroids. 

18:14:09&nbsp;
kristina
No, I have found that people who attend have so many questions that I don't need to set a theme, but if you have one in mind, please do open up the discussion.

18:14:26&nbsp;
kristina
Do you use the sea salt in your enema?

18:14:38&nbsp;
Tim
yes i do

18:14:40&nbsp;
Joseph
I have tried your retention enema of olive oil, msm, aloe vera juice with a bulb syringe, and was wondering if that was the proper method?  Also, I did not void until the following morning and was a little concerned.

18:15:15&nbsp;
kristina
If you could describe in detail what solution you are using in each enema in your series, that would help. And also if you are dealing with constipation or any bowel imbalances.

18:15:23&nbsp;
kristina
I meant, actually...

18:15:59&nbsp;
LoneEagle
For this chat or the next one, how about the proper way to clean the bags and equipment? Also what items you should or should not put in your solution.

18:15:59&nbsp;
Tim
I use soap for the first enema and have not been rinsing because it seems to retain...

18:16:01&nbsp;
kristina
Joseph, did you clear your colon out with a cleansing enema before you implanted the olive oil, msm and aloe vera juice?

18:16:10&nbsp;
Carol45
I have held the olive oil, msm, and aloe vera for 24 hours.

18:16:29&nbsp;
kristina
It is just fine if a therapeutic implant stays in the colon for as long as 24 hours.

18:16:42&nbsp;
kristina
Welcome, Coltar15mod.

18:16:48&nbsp;
Jim_C
I have a mild case of ulcerative colitis in the sigmoid region, commonly called proctitis.   I have been treating with corticort enema (cortisone) 2x per 24 hr.  I have recently been supplementing with aloe vera leaf juice 99% enema.

18:16:52&nbsp;
kristina
Welcome edbth2004nota

18:17:02&nbsp;
Jim_C
The doctor says the aloe is a waste of time

18:17:09&nbsp;
Joseph
I did kristina, with purified water, a little peppermint oil

18:17:33&nbsp;
Jim_C
I told him I don't think he is right about that.  He insisted the aloe was a waste

18:18:49&nbsp;
kristina
If you use a soap suds enema, please do either use castile soap or our goat milk soap. You do need to rinse the soap. If the rinse enema isn't releasing, you could be dehydrated. Add peppermint essential oil, along with the sea salt. I also recommend a Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis to determine your electrolyte levels because if you use 1 tsp of sea salt per quart of water and are not releasing the enema solution, it could be a sign of electrolyte deficiency.

18:18:55&nbsp;
Jim_C
I thought aloe had some healing qualities and in combo with cortisone enema would actually be a benefit.  I also thought I read confirmation about aloe benefit for UC on the Mayo clinic web site

18:18:56&nbsp;
Joseph
Thank you kristina, I will continue using the bulb syringe for the retention enema.

18:19:00&nbsp;
kristina
What are your goals in using the aloe?

18:19:41&nbsp;
Jim_C
My goal is to reduce UC inflammation and bleeding with the aloe in combo with the cortisone enema

18:19:58&nbsp;
Jim_C
actually my goal is to send UC into remission

18:21:10&nbsp;
kristina
Applied internally, aloe gel is a mild anesthetic, relieving itching, swelling, and pain: it also is antibacterial and antifungal, increases blood flow to the colon, and stimulates fibroblasts, the skin cells responsible for wound healing. 

18:21:38&nbsp;
Carol45
Lone Eagle, I like your suggestion. 

18:21:39&nbsp;
kristina
Well, Jim, you can do just that. How is your colon responding to the implants thus far?

18:21:54&nbsp;
kristina
Have you made an dietary changes, as diet is often a key factor in UC?

18:22:01&nbsp;
Carol45
Hello Billy and all recent joiners.

Hello everybody

18:22:39&nbsp;
Coltar15mod
Is a colon tube better than a retention nozzle when doing an enema that has    reach the vein in the colon?

18:22:40&nbsp;
kristina
I, too, like your idea, Lone Eagle. Those will be the topics of the next live chat, and if you wish, we can start that discussion now.

18:22:48&nbsp;

Hi from Scotland. I'm 56F - came off HRT 6 months ago and since have been suffering badly from menopause flushes as we call them here. No other symptoms.  I do daily pure water enemas in the morning. Advice/help?

18:23:21&nbsp;
LoneEagle
I would say ask away now and we can contine next time

18:23:30&nbsp;
Jim_C
I believe the the cortisone (corticade) is helping and I believe the aloe has helped even more.  I had a sigmoidoscopy yesterday and the inflammation is greatly improved.  Why would an expert doctor discount aloe?

18:23:32&nbsp;
Tim
Thanks Kristina - I do use castile soap.

18:24:02&nbsp;
LoneEagle
My first question is what are things that you should never put into your solution?

18:24:35&nbsp;
kristina
To get started, I want to direct you all to www.enemabag.com, which is going through the process of a complete overhaul. For starters, we have added lots of new information that includes safe and unsafe enema solutions.

18:24:38&nbsp;
Joseph
wine?

18:24:54&nbsp;
LoneEagle
I have heard that using hydrogen perixiode in the solution would help the material release better

18:24:56&nbsp;
kristina
As long as the bulb syringe works well, it is a great tool.

18:25:28&nbsp;
Joseph
I read a story about a man who passed away from taking a wine enema

18:25:51&nbsp;
LoneEagle
Sorry about the typos - I am trying to use more than two fingers

18:25:59&nbsp;
kristina
Some say the colon tube is better. But it really depends on how much solution you put into the colon and the individual's competence on getting the solution where it needs to go.

18:26:07&nbsp;
Carol45
When I used the bulb syringe for the olive oil etc implant, when I released the bulb it suctioned the oil right back out!  First time using a bulb.

18:26:10&nbsp;
Lisa
Please, no wine enemas! I've also heard from people dying from them!

18:26:12&nbsp;
Jim_C
Kristina, I reduced the amount of gluten, although I never really had a gluten issue that I'm aware of.  My mild case (thank god) of UC came on after my stopping smoking (cold turkey) after 40 years.

18:26:33&nbsp;
kristina
The portal vein is not far along in the colon so you only need to deliver the solution a mere 20-30 inches into the colon.

18:27:30&nbsp;
kristina
A colon tube is designed to do just that, so is an excellent tool for that purpose, but if one finds inserting a colon tube into their colon that deeply at all difficult, then a retention nozzle with the appropriate amount of solution would work just as well.

18:28:16&nbsp;
Carol45
I attached my colon tube to the bulb.

18:28:39&nbsp;
billythekid
Is there such a thing as a large-sized &quot;ramp clamp&quot;?

18:28:55&nbsp;
Joseph
That's wild, Carol, mine seemed to go in and not come out until many hours later!

18:28:56&nbsp;
kristina
I think you would need to use about 1-2 quarts of solution. Also, the position in which you take the enema implant can help you retain the solution, which is also why people tend to navigate toward a colon tube. A colon tube helps you bypass the part of the colon that stimulates your nervous system so that you feel full in your colon even when you are not full in your colon.

18:29:34&nbsp;
ghung
I have had 5 sessions of coffee enema. What are the benefits of the coffee enema?

18:30:06&nbsp;
kristina
Welcome Scotland... Sorry about the struggles. Good job for coming off the HRT. I would want to take a look at your diet and I would most likely recommend that you use an oral progesterone called Progest E.

18:30:51&nbsp;
kristina
Have you noticed any benefits with using the enemas for relief from the menopausal flushes?

18:31:21&nbsp;
Carol45
Are there any side effects to watch for with the Progest E?  I'm using it 3-4 times a day.  

18:32:15&nbsp;
kristina
Doctors are trained in drugs and surgery and not herbs, colon cleansing, and the like, so unless they have done the research on their own time, I would hope that a doctor might say, &quot;let me know what you think&quot; to their client in order to be able to learn more from their patients.

18:32:56&nbsp;
kristina
Do you know the tubing diameter that you are looking to fit a ramp clamp to, as our ramp clamp can accommodate different sized hosing

18:33:22&nbsp;
Carol45
The Pregnenolone I cycled off for two weeks.  On returning to it, the face rash returned and the second day I had a headache, so will stop for a few days and try again at a lower dosage. 

18:33:54&nbsp;
kristina
The topic of enema solutions is a broad one. Of course, I believe strongly in only putting solutions into your colon that will improve your health. 

18:34:06&nbsp;
kristina
Many oils work well in the colon.

18:34:13&nbsp;
billythekid
One step above 5/16 - whatever that is?

18:34:20&nbsp;
kristina
I would never use mineral oil.

18:34:34&nbsp;
edbth
Hi again, generally good - fish, chicken, fruit, veg, little brown bread - and in the last week onto progesterone in external body cream... lemon juice first in the morning... like a couple of glasses of wine in the evening... yes, wrong!

18:34:40&nbsp;
kristina
Our ramp clamp would work. Or, have you tried it and it didn't?

18:35:31&nbsp;
kristina
I don't think I am keeping up with this wonderful chat, so do post again if I haven't addressed your issue. Thanks.

What is the positive effect of oil in the colon?

18:36:00&nbsp;
billythekid
It does not seem to close fully and the solution leaks. Maybe I need more muscle.

18:36:23&nbsp;
Carol45
Eliminating bread products also has a positive effect - although I cheated badly over the holidays!

18:36:51&nbsp;
kristina
Progest E....A woman ought to be able to use Progest E for at least 3 months without any ill effect. After that, the issues to look out for would be any irregularity with one's menses. But, I don't believe this applies to you, right, Carol?

18:36:55&nbsp;
Jim_C
eliminating bread products has a positive effect for what?

18:37:43&nbsp;
Carol45
I believe I have stopped - at 60 I thought it would last forever!

18:38:27&nbsp;
Carol45
Stomach ache / intestinal cramps and gas.

18:38:40&nbsp;
kristina
Bread...why does it work to cut out the grains... gluten, antinutrients, starch... sometimes irritate one's gut... when you take a vacation from ALL grains... most people see an improvement in their health, especially if one's issues are of the digestive tract.

When you start taking the Pregnenolone again, Carol, open the capsule and take only 5 mg per day, okay?

18:41:12&nbsp;
Carol45
There are always things I like to go back and reread. everything flies by when we're chatting.   Yes to Pregnenolone.

I have read that when you reach the &quot;super senior&quot; age group such as I have, that milk loses its nutritional value and can be detrimental. Is there any substance to that claim?

18:42:05&nbsp;
kristina
Scotland, do you eat red meat? Do you have access to high-quality red meats? Do you have access to raw dairy products? Also, it sounds like you might need to replace all your starchy carbohydrates with fruit sugars for a while.

18:42:37&nbsp;
LoneEagle
You can walk around and do whatever you want to do, work through the cramps without leaking.

18:43:08&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, this month's chat will be posted on the website! I just had an overwhelming feeling of how much you guys all mean to me. Thank you so much for supporting the work that I do!

18:43:35&nbsp;
LoneEagle
Just make sure you lube, lube, and lube the internal bulb before inserting 

18:43:52&nbsp;
kristina
Did you also go off other possible offending foods? You might just work through my book for the entire 35-day program or we could work over the phone, if you are able to do that.

18:43:58&nbsp;

You're great, kristina - we love you and the work you do!

On the subject of how to clean your enema equipment, can others tell what they do to clean their bags and tubing?

If everyone is like me, I wish we all lived near Madison.

18:46:04&nbsp;

I use a regular red 2 qt. enema bag and a small flexi-nozzle. when I am through, I rinse the nozzle with soap and hot water and I rinse the bag with hot soapy water.  Before I use them again, I rinse the nozzle and bag with hot water.

For IBS-C, I recommend a frankincense and myrrh or chamomile and clary sage soapy enema with sea salt, followed by a sea salt and plain water or peppermint and water, followed by an implant with olive oil, msm and aloe vera. I would rotate the implant each time with a coffee enema and a bifidonate implant. Also, you might consider taking a bottle or two of cascara sagrada, aged bark only

does oil enema address mild UC (proctitis)?

For those of you who don't know: Proctitis is an inflammation of the lining of the rectum causing pain, soreness, bleeding, and a discharge of mucus or pus. Proctitis can last a long or a short amount of time. When the inflammation extends beyond the rectum, the condition is often referred to as proctocolitis

Butter oil would be my first choice as a colon implant when there is chronic inflammation in the colon.

I was using a generic non-drowsy &quot;tylenol/sinus&quot; daily for months on end to help with my breathing.  Never thought about it being constipating until a friend suggested it may have been.
