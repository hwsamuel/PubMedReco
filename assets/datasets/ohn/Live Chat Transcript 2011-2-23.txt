Hi Dennis.

13:14:30
deedee
Do you have specific questions for me today?

13:14:47
deedee
Hi Michael. Glad to see you are back in computer world!

13:15:39
deedee
Hi Alan and Phil.

13:15:45
Alan D
Hello

13:16:10
deedee
Are we all wanting to talk about the prostate, which is what we said we'd like to talk about this month? 

13:16:13
dennisr
Are there any herbs to help lessen cramping?

13:16:48
michael b
Most glad to see all of you here at this chat.

13:17:02
deedee
We are getting some great testimonials about  essential oils and the prostate.  I also have some herbs that have been shown to help certain prostate issues.

13:17:18
deedee
Welcome Gleener.

13:17:35
gleener
Hi

13:17:40
deedee
Dennis, give me some more info on when you cramp and what you are using.

13:18:15
deedee
There are some soothing and relaxing oils that can be put into the water that can relax the muscles which can hopefully prevent cramping.

13:18:46
deedee
Welcome Jim P. 

13:18:48
gleener
I have some  info  on  high PSA results.

13:18:59
deedee
Gleener, please share.

13:19:44
gleener
Well there is a second test  called Free PSA...

13:20:28
deedee
For cramping - lavender, rosemary, fennel marjoram, orange work well.  I can make you a custom blend if you'd like.

13:20:43
gleener
...and  that  can  save  you  from  the  biopsy,  folks.

13:21:06
deedee
Is there a link to a website, etc. where people can read more about this?

13:21:39
gleener
I'm  sure  it  will  come  up  on google.

13:21:58
dennisr
I use celtic sea salt ONLY, about one tablespoon to one quart of water. I have the enema enter about one quart every 15 mins. Sometime even slower. Cramping starts at about 3/4 of a quart as it enters. Any ideas? I use the Left Sims position.

13:22:30
gleener
The  free  part  has  to  do  with  free radicals,   I  think.

13:23:17
deedee
Of course there are several different prostate issues. For BPH,  the essential oils known to work for this are: frankincense, myrrh, sage, Idaho balsam fir, and blue cypress.

13:24:13
deedee
I have been making a mixture of this or a combination of a few of these for people to make suppositories from, or you can directly implant with olive oil, etc., after an enema.  The suppositories work well before sleep.  You just put them in and lie down and the absorb into the area directly.

13:24:25
gleener
High PSA  has  a  genetic  link.

13:24:57
deedee
Thank you for that information, Gleener. That is helpful.

13:25:56
gleener
Many cousins,  uncles,  etc.,  run  it  high   but  no  cancer     yet.

13:26:31
deedee
We also incorporate herbs into the picture to use orally, or they could also be implanted.  Herbs like Korean ginseng, saw palmetto, nettle root, and cramp bark.

13:26:38
gleener
I   do  have   BPH.

13:27:43
deedee
You may want to try some of these oil and/or herbs and see what effect they may have for you.

13:28:18
gleener
I'll  get  those   from  you later  if OK.  

13:28:28
dennisr
Thanks, I'll get those herbs.

13:29:32
deedee
Another issue with the prostate is prostatitis.

13:30:10
deedee
Thanks Gleener, we'll talk later.

13:30:11
dennisr
Why does the colon tube curl inside and not go through the colon or follow it?

13:30:16
deedee
Welcome Doug.

13:30:59
michael b
Remember in the 1980s and 1990s many would love to do operations on folks for the money, not just watch what is going on, and see what happens? Think cash cow.

13:31:39
Doug M
Hi DeeDee.

13:31:43
deedee
For prostatitis you could use an implant or suppository of peppermint, chamomile, wintergreen, rosemary, myrtle, thyme, tsuga, blue cypress, Di-Gize.

13:32:22
deedee
The herbs we would use for this would be echinacea, saw palmetto, licorice, buchu, and corn silk.

13:34:00
Doug M
I have diabetes and hold a lot of water.

13:34:02
deedee
I think the oil suppositories are a good way to go.  They are easy to make up and you put them right where the most absorption will take place.  It will be direct.

13:35:34
deedee
Dennis, the colon tube usually curls because the passageway is not open enough for it to keep traveling.  Do you use water flowing in when you are inserting?  Also, try different positions to try to open the passageway better.

13:36:19
deedee
Doug, what have you tried in your water?

13:36:49
Doug M
Baking soda.

13:37:23
deedee
Hi shamus m and rja1115 - welcome.

13:37:39
dennisr
Yes, I use water even before I insert the colon tube! 

13:37:40
deedee
Doug, have you tried any celtic sea salt yet?

13:38:22
Doug M
No I have heart problems, also CHF.

13:38:23
michael b
It is great that what you say can be checked later in past logs of these chats. I know remembering all of this is not so easy.

13:38:31
deedee
Peppermint can also help the body purge of extra water.

13:39:01
deedee
Yes, there are always archives of the live chats to check back on.

13:39:37
deedee
Is anyone else experiencing prostate issues?

13:40:00
deedee
These things can all be done preventatively also.

13:40:30
gleener
I'm  back      - sorry.

13:42:02
Doug M
I think we need to set up a phone call so you can learn more about my history, How much per minute?

13:42:02
gleener
DeeDee,  I'll call and leave  voicemail  if OK.

13:42:52
deedee
The consult is $ 1.40 per minute and I would love to hear of your situation.

13:44:06
Doug M
What is a good time to call?

13:44:50
deedee
For consult, we have to set up a specific day and time.

13:45:14
deedee
Next week I do have some availability. You can call any time to set up the appt.

13:46:22
Doug M
OK, I will call you! Thanks.

13:46:28
gleener
Do  you  have  some  of  the  saw palmetto   made  up?

13:47:07
michael b
I worry about diabetes myself. The fact that you, Doug, are aware of this gives you a head start.

13:48:45
deedee
We do have a product that is called prostatrol forte and is saw palmetto, zinc selenium, nettles root, and pygeum bark.  It is in pill form, so you take it orally.

13:49:30
deedee
Diabetes is such an epidemic right now and can be prevented, so that is very encouraging.

13:49:39
gleener
I  was  wondering  about  the  overnight  suppository.

13:50:48
gleener
Are  the  pills  in  the  catalog  somewhere?

13:51:13
deedee
The suppositories would be the essential oils combo that i mentioned above. I can make up the dram bottle of oil and you would make the suppositories at home using coconut oil. You liquify it first, pour it into a little container,

13:52:07
deedee
Drop the drop mixture in the coconut oil, and put it in the fridge until it hardens.  When you are ready, you pop it out and form it with your hands like clay into the shape of a suppository and then insert it.

13:52:15
deedee
Welcome Nan F. 

13:52:33
gleener
How  do  the  pills  affect  blood pressure?

13:52:51
deedee
The pills are on our website - Prostatrol Forte. You can also get some of the herbs in liquid form that you could take orally or in an implant after enema.

13:54:02
gleener
I  do   enemas  regularly and  have  for  50  plus  years.

13:54:26
deedee
I would have to look at each ingredient to see if there is a contraindication for high blood pressure.  I will have to check, but I don't see an issue.

13:54:58
deedee
Enemas can be very preventative for many things.

13:55:12
michael b
Is coconut oil better than olive oil, or does it matter?

13:56:01
gleener
I   have  decided   they  are   so  much  better   than   just  safe.

13:56:07
Alan D
I should take an enema every day but I have a hemorrhoid flare and yeast infection. Too much pain getting the nozzle in....any ideas?

13:56:09
deedee
Coconut oil works better for suppositories, and olive oil works well for implants.

13:57:28
deedee
Alan, we would definitely want to help to heal the hemorrhoids and clear up the yeast.  You may want to try some implanting and suppositories for that also.  A special nozzle for that helps too.

13:57:51
gleener
DeeDee,   I  discovered   today  that  I  ordered  from  you  yesterday

13:58:02
gleener
and  missed  the   discount.

13:58:01
Alan D
Do you sell that nozzle?

13:58:54
deedee
The white or black delrin nozzles are much more comfortable for hemorrhoids and  fissures.

13:59:18
deedee
Gleener, we can talk and I will honor the discount for you this time - just give me a call.

13:59:52
Alan D
OK thanks.

14:00:12
gleener
OK   and  thanks  from  me  also.

14:00:21
deedee
Alan, we can talk more in depth if you want, about yeast issues and what to do for your hemorrhoids.

14:00:36
michael b
I cannot help thinking your typing speed has picked up since taking over these chats.

14:00:39
gleener
I'll  just  use  the  difference  on  a  future  order.

14:01:29
Alan D
I have used nystain powder for the yeast and hydrocortizone suppository for the hemorrhoids. I also have chronic constipation do to narcotics I take for back pain.

14:02:23
deedee
I wanted to let you know of a recent testimonial we got about healing from prostate cancer. Someone's father has the cancer and his number was 7.09. After using frankincense 28 drops and orange 15 drops twice per day for six weeks, the number went down to 0.04.  The docs couldn't believe it !

14:04:02
gleener
PSA is NOT definitive... Thanks. Must go now. I'll call today if OK.

14:04:36
deedee
Thank you everyone. I am sorry I was late.  The password was changed without my knowledge, so it took me a bit to get in.

14:05:19
deedee
Yes, very true about the PSA, though that is how the medical community measures.

14:06:37
deedee
I will hopefully talk to all of you more in the future. Take care, everyone.

14:07:00
Alan D
Thanks DeeDee.

14:07:40
michael b
Stay warm and healthy. 

14:08:12
deedee
Thanks - same to you all.
