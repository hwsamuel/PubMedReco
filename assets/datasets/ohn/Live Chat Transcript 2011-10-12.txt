randyu
I have diverticuli, but not that bad. Do I need to check with my MD before getting colon cleanse done?

20:00:12
kristina
Hi Randy! Here are the contraindications for colon hydrotherapy: You shouldn't have colonics if you have uncontrolled hypertension or congestive heart failure, an aneurysm, severe anemia, GI hemorrhage/perforation, severe hemorrhoids, renal insufficiency, cirrhosis, carcinoma of the colon, fistulas, abdominal hernia, recent colon surgery (less than three months prior), or are in the first or third trimester of pregnancy. 

20:00:51
randyu
So I am good to go then on the cleanse?

20:01:39
kristina
Yes, but let's go into a bit more detail on the diverticuli. How do you know that you have it? And, how do you know how severe they are?

20:02:36
randyu
Had a colonostomy in September 2009 at hospital; doctor confirmed it with that and the pics they took. Not that bad, but I have IBS.

20:03:13
randyu
I took that info from the follow-up report of the test and the pics.

20:03:38
kristina
Do you have pain in your colon?

20:04:05
kristina
And what are your colon cleansing plans?

20:04:09
randyu
No pain; just certain foods trigger symptoms.  Get cramps sometimes.

20:04:47
randyu
Have a cleanse done by a local certified person.  

20:06:45
kristina
Sounds like a great idea.

20:07:01
rick
Good evening, Kristina.

20:07:09
randyu
Hi Rick...

20:08:11
randyu
I think having it done is much better than trying to cleanse at home myself, at least in the beginning.  

20:08:13
kristina
Do you feel tired all the time? Do you have more to get done than a 24-hour day allows? Are you often sick, or do you just feel run down and stressed? If so, REAL Tonic for Health is a natural therapy for many of these situations. REAL Tonic for Health is thoughtfully designed to be a nourishing tonic for all bodily systems â€” circulatory, immune, hormonal, adrenal, respiratory, and digestive.

20:08:43
randyu
What is the tonic and how do you take it?

20:09:00
randyu
Yes, I have those symptoms sometimes.

20:09:09
kristina
Either way would work well, Randy. If you need assistance clearing out your colon, with the same therapeutic effect as a professional colon cleanse, we can guide you through a phone consult or video chat.

20:09:22
kristina
The REAL Tonic for Health formula takes its name from the 4 distinct herbs that are contained in its formula:
      1. Rehmannia     -- promotes healthy adrenal gland function and liver health;     encourages normal bowel function;     facilitates a healthy response to occasional stress -- Rehmannia root 1:2 extract 5 mL from Rehmannia glutinosa root 2.5 g

20:09:33
kristina
2. Echinacea     -- enhances immune system function;     supports healthy immune response following stress, sudden changes in weather, or temperature;     promotes healthy white blood cells;     encourages upper respiratory function;     supports the function of a healthy lymphatic system -- Echinacea root 1:2 extract from Echinacea purpurea root 1.5 g; Echinacea root 1:2 extract from Echinacea angustifolia root 1.0 g; Total alkylamides from both extracts: 7.5 mg 

20:09:43
kristina
 3. Ashwaganda     -- supports the body as it ages by promoting a healthy response to environmental stress;     enhances immune response;     promotes an overall feeling of well-being -- Ashwaganda root 1:1 extract 5 mL from Withania somnifera root: 5.0 g; Contains withanolides: 10 mg

20:09:53
kristina
4. Licorice     -- promotes healthy adrenal gland function;     supports and soothes the digestive and urinary tract systems;     supports healthy lung function -- Licorice root 1:1 extract 2.5 mL from Glycyrrhiza glabra root 2.5 g; Contains glycyrrhizin: 75 mg

20:10:08
kristina
You take it one to three times a day, depending on your need and ability.

20:10:29
kristina
When these 4 herbs are combined, they drastically improve your immune function by helping the body adapt to stresses as well as promoting the creation of healthy white blood cells; increase energy by nourishing your adrenal glands; promote vitality and stamina in people of any age; increase mental clarity;    nourish the entire body;     support and maintain the body as it ages;     support the body's natural defenses against emotional and environmental stressors;     and promote an overall feeling of well-being. REAL Tonic for Health can be customized to address your individual biological needs.

I've studied all of Dr. Walker's books, I drink the juice of 3 lbs. of carrots, one beet, one apple, and 3 big handfuls of spinach every day. Been doing it for 15 years and not been sick ever since. 

20:15:18
randyu
Kristina, will the cleansing help control the IBS symptoms by itself?

20:15:41
kristina
That is quite a story, Rick. Every day, without fail, you drink that much juice and haven't been sick once? What else do you eat?

20:16:37
LiveFree
I am online but have never been in a chat room before.  Do I just ask questions or respond to the other comments?

20:16:49
kristina
You can do both or either.

20:16:54
kristina
Thanks for joining us.

20:18:11
LiveFree
Thank you.  I am impressed that Rick drinks all of that juice every day!  I tried that for a long time but found green smoothies to be better for me.  The only dilemma I have with Dr. Walker's books (they're GREAT!) is that he recommends drinking distilled water.

Only every 2 weeks, Rick?  How many, one?

20:23:33

Walker did not think distilled water was good. He said to get your live water from juicing.

20:23:46
LiveFree
Right now I do an enema every 2 or 3 days to move along.  I also did a 6-week juice fast and daily colonics and it really helped!  But the cost was ##&amp;&amp;&amp;!!!

You stated that in your CD set but am not sure it's getting to the cecum...

20:25:40
kristina
Hi Clint.

20:25:45
Clint S
How often do you recommend doing a complete colon flush?

20:26:16
kristina
How often one needs to cleanse the colon depends on the individual.

20:26:33
Clint S
Hi. What is the usual rule of thumb for that?

20:26:45
randyu
Kristina, you said with flu season coming up, enemas are a good prevention and treatment for the winter viruses?

20:27:10
LiveFree
If I do an enema with coffee every 2 or 3 days, is that addictive?

20:27:27
kristina
A hair tissue mineral analysis (HTMA) gives you a picture of what toxins are stored in your body and what your optimal colon cleanse schedule might be. Using the hair analysis on a seasonal basis will guide you to the colon cleansing program that will most suit your needs.

20:27:29
randyu
Are these just low volume water enemas during flu season?

20:28:28
kristina
Testing - Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis (HTMA)   Price: $65.00 which includes a consultation

20:28:45
kristina
The Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis (HTMA) is an invaluable screening tool which allows a correct program of diet and supplementation to be designed for each individual's specific needs.

20:28:54
kristina
The three areas of analysis are: 1) Nutrient mineral/electrolyte levels in the body's tissues are measured including Calcium; Chromium; Magnesium; Selenium; Sodium; Phosphorus; Potassium; Nickel; Iron; Cobalt; Copper; Molybdenum; Manganese; Lithium; Zinc; Boron; 2) Toxic metal levels to determine the heavy metal load in the body including Lead; Mercury; Cadmium; Arsenic; Aluminum; 3) Significant mineral ratios that help determine carbohydrate metabolism, thyroid function, level of inflammation, adrenal reserves, copper toxicity, tissue breakdown, and calcium shell.

20:29:16
rick
I start with a 2-liter, then raise it by 3/4 liter each time, do it 4 times to 4-1/4 liters. Use a tea mix, haven't used coffee yet, been doing this 15 years too.

20:29:42
kristina
Taking a coffee enema every 2-3 days is not necessarily addictive.

20:30:06
LiveFree
Can you do a hair mineral analysis through the mail?  The clinic near here charges unbelievably much more than you do...

20:30:16
randyu
Can you do hair tissue test for me by mail?  That is a good price!

20:30:35
randyu
The local prices are much higher...

20:30:35
kristina
Unless you are under time constraints, I always recommend taking a full enema series to clear out the entire colon.

20:30:49
kristina
Yes, we can do the HTMA by mail and over the phone.

20:31:00
Clint S
What do you mean by an enema series?

20:31:24
LiveFree
Rick, what kind of tea mix do you use?  Kristina, how can I do the HTMA by mail - go online on your website?

20:31:30
kristina
A good enema program occurs when you are able to infuse enough filtered water into your colon to stimulate peristalsis throughout the entire colon, thus cleansing the entire colon -- not just the rectal or sigmoid areas. Once enough water is in the colon, you then expel it, along with the resulting waste, into the toilet. You then repeat the process one or two more times.

20:31:38
kristina
This is called an enema series.

20:32:05
LiveFree
Do you have to do it upside down to get it down to the cecum?

20:32:28
LiveFree
By upside down I mean with my head down and my you-know-what up.

20:33:12
kristina
No, you do not need to be upside down to get the water to the cecum. You want to take in as much as one gallon of water during one of the enemas in a series and you want to take three in a row and you want to use an essential oil in the second enema.

20:34:04
LiveFree
I have your 2-CD set so I'll have to study it again.  My concern is putting so much water into my colon, even for an extended period of time.

20:34:27
rick
I use Flor-Essence tea and Peppermint.

20:34:34
kristina
Essential oils will help to stimulate peristalsis so that the entire colon empties during the enema series.

20:34:45
kristina
Colon cleanse and essential oils

20:35:08
kristina
You put a lot more water into the colon when you have a colonic.

20:35:16
LiveFree
Rick, thank you.

20:35:30
LiveFree
Yes, you do but it comes right out.

20:36:03
randyu
I still think having someone do the cleanse for you is better.

20:36:30
LiveFree
I agree, Randy, but it's pretty expensive over time.

20:36:40
randyu
How is the colonic different for the enema?  You don't need to hold the water in and it comes right out?

20:36:48
kristina
The enema water comes right out when you sit on the toilet. Assisting the water to easily leave the colon is another function of the essential oil. Also, use a high quality sea salt, like Celtic sea salt.

20:37:25
kristina
Basically, and you are with a therapist. 

20:38:47
LiveFree
Is that all covered in your CD set?  I find colonics easier because I don't have to keep getting up.  I do hold the water in during a colonic but am concerned putting too much in during an enema that doesn't come out as fast.  Does that make sense?

20:39:00
randyu
Do any insurance cover colonics with a doctor script?

20:40:05
kristina
How to take an enema

20:41:29
LiveFree
Kristina, this may sound weird, but what do you think about squatting after the enema?  Is that better for you?

20:41:59
kristina
And, yes, the two DVDs, All About Enemas and Cleansing, Coffee Enemas and Colon Tubes, detail how to take therapeutic enemas that have the same colon cleansing value as colon hydrotherapy.

20:42:14
kristina
LiveFree, not weird at all.

20:42:35
rick
Another great book out there is The China Study.

20:42:59
LiveFree
I bought a platform board to help with that procedure but it's so awkward I have a hard time using it, plus it makes me laugh while I'm up on it!

20:43:02
kristina
Yes, squatting can be very useful after an enema, which is why we offer and sell a lot of Welles Steps, or squatting stools.

20:43:21
kristina
It is funny, isn't it?

20:43:48
kristina
I am not aware of any insurance that covers a doctor's script for colonics. Let me know if you know differently.

20:43:53
LiveFree
Yes, it's a real scream!  I don't tell many people about it!  It's not something I'd advertise on YouTube, like a recipe!

20:44:49
kristina
And, another great book out there is called Ten Days to Optimal Health!

20:45:26
kristina
This book is a step-by-step guide to nutritional therapy and colon cleansing. It includes important self-help strategies for people who want to take responsibility for their own health and well-being. It is an excellent program for people who need to be gluten-free.

20:45:45
kristina
The program that I designed includes the nutritional research work of Dr. Weston A. Price, who studied the diets of fourteen traditional societies during the 1930s and 1940s. His goal was to understand what makes human beings healthy and what allows them to have perfect teeth. The food Kristina recommends to readers are the traditional foods that gave health to the populations that Price researched. And, the diet is gluten-free!

20:45:50
LiveFree
I  bought that book but disagree with eating dairy and meat at all.  I know you think it's the best approach but for me with my colon I have to be raw!

20:46:42
kristina
What happens when you eat raw dairy and the rarest meat possible? It is true that everyone is different and one diet doesn't work for everyone.

20:46:55
kristina
What raw foods do you eat?

20:47:07
LiveFree
I love Weston Price information, but am finding out at my age that I have to do what feels right.  I do eat an egg yolk raw every other day.

20:47:34
rick
That will be my next book. I've been wanting to get it. Kristina, what is a true max volume for a series of enemas?

20:47:59
kristina
Do you mean in quarts per enema or in number of enemas?

20:48:23
LiveFree
Green smoothies according to the Raw Family's recipes (and others) plus seed milks, nut milks, raw seeds (soaked first), a little Celtic sea salt, dulse, stuff like that.  I'm feeling so much BETTER!

20:49:29
kristina
You make the milks yourself or do you

20:49:35
kristina
buy them at the store?

20:49:37
rick
Quarts or liters per enema, not per number.

20:49:55
kristina
I do not recommend more than 4 quarts of water.

20:50:18
LiveFree
Yes, I soak first then add water and blend.  Love that stuff!  But I really do miss my pizza! (but know it's not WORTH IT anymore!)

20:50:50
LiveFree
The green smoothies are making a huge difference in my energy level.

20:51:46
rick
That seems to be where it just naturally stops, between 4 and 5 quarts with me.

20:51:48
