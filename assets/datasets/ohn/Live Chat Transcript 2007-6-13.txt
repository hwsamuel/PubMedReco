Good Evening *choochoo*  Welcome aboard.

21:00:21&nbsp;
kristina
Hi Carol, it is so good to see that you are here!

21:00:39&nbsp;
kristina
How are you? How is the job? Your body?

21:00:59&nbsp;
Carol45
I've been too busy at work - almost forgot the chat was tonight!

21:01:31&nbsp;
Dana B
Hi from Athens, Georgia! It's my first time in the chat.

21:01:39&nbsp;
kristina
Thanks for showing up. I just realized today that the Live Chat reminder didn't go out so I am pleased to see that you remembered.

21:01:58&nbsp;
kristina
Welcome, Dana. I am very pleased to &quot;meet&quot; you.

21:02:10&nbsp;
Carol45
Welcome Dana - I'm in Illinois.

21:02:24&nbsp;
Dana B
Thanks, I emailed you the other day about my Dad who lives in Wisconsin.

21:02:27&nbsp;
kristina
I am from Wisconsin. The rest of you...?

21:02:34&nbsp;
kristina
Did your dad stop by?

21:03:09&nbsp;
Dana B
Not yet. I'm encouraging him to do an initial consultation with you.

21:03:20&nbsp;
Mike K
San Diego here

21:03:37&nbsp;
kristina
Do you want to tell us more about your dad or what did you have on your mind? Any questions that you have?

21:03:45&nbsp;
Dana B
Yes, thanks.

21:03:51&nbsp;
billythekid
New Orleans here

21:04:00&nbsp;
kristina
Mike, welcome. I didn't know that you lived in San Diego...How are you tonight?

21:04:18&nbsp;
kristina
Given that there was no reminder that went out, we are doing really well with attendance. 

21:04:27&nbsp;
Carol45
Looks the whole country is represented East, West, North, South and Central

21:04:29&nbsp;
Dana B
He just had a colonoscopy and 14 polyps removed. They were all low grade dysplasia.

21:04:31&nbsp;
kristina
Did anyone get the chance to look at the new www.enemabag.com?

21:05:01&nbsp;
billythekid
yes, I liked it

21:05:03&nbsp;
Karen
I haven't yet

21:05:08&nbsp;
Mike K
actually 35 mi. northeast of San Diego

21:05:13&nbsp;
kristina
Did your dad know that he had anything going on with his health?

21:05:38&nbsp;
kristina
Karen, what do you have on your mind tonight?

21:05:44&nbsp;
Dana B
Kristina, can my dad have hydrotherapy considering the dysplasia/polyps?

21:06:28&nbsp;
Dana B
Yes, he did. But I think he's really motivated to do some lifestyle changes.

21:06:49&nbsp;
Karen
Was kind of interested in trying the use of enemas ...23 weeks preg. ...been having problems with constipation

21:07:18&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, he can. Do you know if his dyplasia is low grade or high grade?

21:07:24&nbsp;
Dana B
low grade. 

21:07:40&nbsp;
Lisa
Hi everyone!

21:08:09&nbsp;
Dana B
He wants to set up an appointment with you. I suggested an initial hydrotherapy session, but didn't know what was best to start.

21:08:18&nbsp;
kristina
For those of who who don't know what dyplasis is, it is the earliest form of pre-cancerous lesion recognizable in a pap smear or in a biopsy by a pathologist.

21:08:30&nbsp;
Carol45
Karen - back in '74 my doctor advised me to use enemas when I was pregnant and constipated.  Told me to use the knee-chest position and NOT to strain. 

21:08:51&nbsp;
kristina
That is great that it is low grade. The risk of low grade dysplasia transforming into high grade dysplasia and, eventually, cancer is low. 

21:08:56&nbsp;
Carol45
Good evening Lisa

21:09:15&nbsp;
Lisa
Hi Carol!

21:09:24&nbsp;
Dana B
Yesterday at the UW the surgeon suggested he get a colostomy in July! 

21:10:19&nbsp;
kristina
He can start with either a consultation or the consultation with the colon hydrotherapy. It is cheaper to do the initial consultation with the colon hydrotherapy because it comes with free consultation time. He ought to call and not just stop by because both my shipping clerk and my receptionist are going on vacation... do you believe it.... at the same time... starting tomorrow!

21:10:44&nbsp;
kristina
And, the kids are getting out of school... I thought I was busy before....

21:10:53&nbsp;
Dana B
ok, I'll definitely tell him to call and make an appointment.

21:11:19&nbsp;
Mike K
Timing is everything (L)

21:11:34&nbsp;
kristina
I don't understand why a surgeon would suggest a colostomy. He needs to get a few additional opinions. How is he doing?

21:11:53&nbsp;
kristina
Hi Lisa!

21:12:10&nbsp;
Lisa
Hi Kristina!!

21:12:38&nbsp;
kristina
Karen, have you ever taken enemas before? How often are your bowels moving? 

21:12:42&nbsp;
Dana B
He's great actually. He had ulcerative colitis on and off for the last 15 years. I guess that's one reason they were concerned. I told him it seemed extreme to me. His bowel movements are fine.

21:13:46&nbsp;
Carol45
Additional opinions are definitely in order. 

21:14:21&nbsp;
kristina
I very much look forward to working with him. He might start with reading my book, Ten Days to Optimal Health.

21:14:22&nbsp;
Dana B
My dad's 71 too. He'd like to try working with you, Kristina, and then getting a colonscopy in 3 months. 

21:14:47&nbsp;
Dana B
I'll tell him to read the chat notes and check out your book.

21:15:55&nbsp;
kristina
Enemas work great for relieving constipation while pregnant. However, I cannot advise that you take enemas while pregnant because in the healing community there is a tension that if someone recommends something and the woman goes into early labor or something happens to the baby that it is the fault of the &quot;thing&quot; recommended. 

21:16:15&nbsp;
michael b
hello everyone, i hope all are well or getting there.

21:16:27&nbsp;
kristina
If you decide to take enemas, I would take it slow - one enema - filtered water - and go from there.

21:16:35&nbsp;
kristina
Hello Michael

21:17:30&nbsp;
kristina
It is an excellent idea for your dad to work on a healing program and then be retested. He can strengthen his body and have an excellent report.

21:17:44&nbsp;
kristina
Do you know what he has done over these years for his colitis?

21:17:58&nbsp;
Dana B
Thanks for the encouragement. 

21:18:27&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, and straining can lead to terrible hemorrhoids and anal fissures. You don't want that. I took enemas while pregnant and know many women who have with great success.

21:19:11&nbsp;
kristina
A woman just needs the confidence that she is doing the right thing. I found that I felt much better when I used enemas instead of being constipated for days.

21:19:21&nbsp;
kristina
How many enemas have you taken in your life?

21:19:37&nbsp;
Dana B
He got it after my mom died (got a lot of health problems then) and he's been trying to eat well, an he does a lot of exercise. But he needs guidance. He definitely would like to try to heal instead of having surgery.

21:19:38&nbsp;
kristina
Go mom!

21:20:09&nbsp;
Carol45
They were a definite help for me during my pregnancy.  The MD was afraid that I would strain too hard otherwise, and he didn't want the baby to pop out ahead of time! :D 

21:20:45&nbsp;
kristina
Lisa, How does this chat time work for you?

21:20:47&nbsp;
kristina
How are you?

21:21:04&nbsp;
Dana B
Well, it's been ten years and now has a new person in his life who he's very happy with.

21:21:11&nbsp;
Lisa
It works great for me!

21:21:19&nbsp;
kristina
Carol, can you tell us how often you would take an enema while pregnant? And, how is your health now?

21:21:42&nbsp;
kristina
Well, good for him.

21:21:56&nbsp;
Lisa
It was rough for a while with my son's surgery, but he seems to be recovering well.

21:22:11&nbsp;
kristina
Can you tell us about your son's surgery?

21:22:34&nbsp;
Dana B
Yes, I think it is a good time for my dad to change his diet since he'll have extra support.

21:22:41&nbsp;
kristina
Karen - do you have an enema bag? 

21:23:48&nbsp;
kristina
Karen, there is a new section on the enemabag.com site about taking enemas safely.

21:24:00&nbsp;
kristina
You might want to read through it to guide you with your confidence

21:24:01&nbsp;
Carol45
My health is still slowly improving - mostly because I'm back at full time stress at work.  As far as being pregnant, after 3 decades it's hard to remember, but probably 2 a week.  The baby liked to lie on my hip bone and slow things down!

21:24:13&nbsp;
kristina
How much water does your enema bag hold?

21:24:19&nbsp;
Lisa
He had a bad hernia and it had to be fixed before leaving the country. He was able to leave the hospital the same day so it was nice he could recover at home. I'm so relieved it's all over! He is getting better every day.

21:25:00&nbsp;
kristina
Who died that you knew from hernia surgery? Isn't that very rare?

21:25:41&nbsp;
Lisa
My aunt died after  hernia surgery!!

21:25:56&nbsp;
Carol45
Lisa, glad your son is doing well and recovering quickly.

21:26:05&nbsp;
kristina
2 quarts is a great sized enema bag to start with. You could even use that in a second enema with the first being the bulb syringe to clear out just the anal area.

21:26:31&nbsp;
kristina
Are you enjoying work, Carol?

21:26:40&nbsp;
Lisa
But my aunt was in very bad health anyway.

21:26:56&nbsp;
Lisa
Thank you Carol!

21:28:25&nbsp;
Carol45
It's a love / hate relationship.  But it is energizing at the same time and definitely keeps the cobwebs out of my brain.  At this old age I feel a sense of accomplishment that I can keep up with and even get ahead of the &quot;kids.&quot;

21:28:32&nbsp;
Dana B
Have there been people with low grade dysplasia who've been able to reverse that condition?

21:28:51&nbsp;
kristina
Is everyone taking time to get plenty of sunshine? Sunshine is crucial for good health because it allows the body to make Vitamin D. Dana, I don't know if your dad is getting sunshine but this is something he could start right away, if he is not.

21:29:16&nbsp;
Dana B
He gardens a lot! Loves the outdoors.

21:29:30&nbsp;
michael b
lisa, h20wmn, you said you were going to be &quot;chatty.&quot;

21:29:52&nbsp;
Lisa
I got plenty of sun today just running around. Lots of bright sun in Texas! It's HOT!!

21:29:53&nbsp;
Karen
I have been out in the sun quite a bit but go inside for a while to take a break

21:30:24&nbsp;
Carol45
Kristina, I turn to a lobster red in about 10 min. so dart from shade tree to shade tree.  Have been taking a drop of D in the morning and evening - is that enough?

21:30:56&nbsp;
kristina
Dana, lots and lots and lots of people with low grade dysplasis have reversed their condition. As I said earlier, the risk of low grade dysplasia transforming into high grade dysplasia and, eventually, cancer is low. 

21:31:09&nbsp;
Lisa
I'm pretty tired tonight so I'm not as chatty as I thought I would be!

21:31:26&nbsp;
kristina
Carol, have you had your vitamin D levels checked?

21:31:30&nbsp;
Lisa
All that sunshine I guess.

21:31:33&nbsp;
billythekid
I play enough golf to get Vitamin D for 10 people

21:31:40&nbsp;
Dana B
Good to hear.

21:32:07&nbsp;
kristina
Here's how:

21:32:10&nbsp;
kristina
Testing Vitamin D Levels     All people must make a personal decision whither or not to test their vitamin D levels based on the amount of vitamin D they are consuming, their own perception of its risk, and any concern they may have that they are not consuming enough.  IF you choose to test your vitamin D level, there are several things to keep in mind:     Order the calcidiol test, not the calcitriol test.  The correct test is also called 25-hydroxyvitamin D or 25 (OH) D  The laboratory?s reference range is likely to use a very wide definition of ?normal?.  Sufficient levels of vitamin D are at least 32 ng/mL, and ideal levels are probably between 40 and 50 ng/mL.  Your vitamin D levels will rise over the spring and summer and decline over the fall and winter.  Your vitamin D level during one season will therefore not necessarily reflect your vitamin D level for other seasons.  The scientific data does not clearly and consistently define an ideal level of vitamin D, and we do not know to what degree intakes of other nutrients affect what constitutes the ideal level.     

21:32:54&nbsp;
Carol45
No on the D levels.  I need a hair cut and another hair analysis too. :p 

21:33:16&nbsp;
kristina
Also, you can ask me on the forum about this if you have further questions or call me up for a phone consultation but given that you aren't able to take much sun, let's up your Vitamin D to 2 drops, 2 times per day, okay Carol?

21:33:46&nbsp;
kristina
You're a golfer, eh, Billy?

21:34:23&nbsp;
Carol45
Got it.  I'll borrow some of Billy's while I'm at it. 

21:34:29&nbsp;
billythekid
Yes, yes, yes

21:34:30&nbsp;
michael b
kristina, i have been taking your advice and putting egg shells in my coffee grinder -- kinda gritty, but washes down with water

21:35:32&nbsp;
kristina
Excellent, Michael. Thanks for telling me. Yes, they are &quot;kind of gritty&quot;! If it gets to be too much, you can put the ground eggshells into empty capsules.

21:35:47&nbsp;
Carol45
I add my eggshells to my goat's milk kefir and they go right down.  Only once had a problem with them getting under my partial. 

21:36:17&nbsp;
Carol45
Have added them back into my scrambled eggs too. 

21:36:19&nbsp;
Dana B
what do the eggshells do?

21:36:31&nbsp;
Lisa
Eggshells in with the coffee beans? I must have missed that advice. What's the reason for doing that?

21:36:48&nbsp;
kristina
Also, on the note of newsletters, the next newsletter is coming out on Friday and we are going to be offering selected silicone enema equipment at a 25% savings because I know many people want the silicone Flowmaster, silicone bag or retention catheter, but since they are pricing don't buy them.

21:37:05&nbsp;
kristina
That is a great idea, Carol. I will have to try that. 

21:37:47&nbsp;
Carol45
Thanks Kristina, great news on the silicone savings!

21:38:35&nbsp;
Carol45
Lisa, the coffee grinder does a better job on the eggshells than the blender. 

21:38:42&nbsp;
kristina
The article is in last month's newsletter. which I see isn't up yet because we are so busy getting our new website ready, which we hope to launch on July 2nd.

21:38:54&nbsp;
kristina
You use the coffee grinder to grind the eggshells.

21:39:08&nbsp;
michael b
properly washed provides calcium without fillers. 

21:39:24&nbsp;
kristina
Eggshells are the best source of calcium available because they don't contain any toxic fillers. 

21:39:40&nbsp;
Carol45
My plants LOVE the water from washing the eggshells.

21:39:58&nbsp;
Dana B
funny, so my mother-law's dad was right. When she was little, in Spain after the Civil War, there wasn't much milk. He made her eat eggshells.

21:40:06&nbsp;
kristina
If any of you don't get the newsletter yet, you subscribe on the home page. We send out a newsletter, with articles and coupons, one time per month.

21:40:36&nbsp;
kristina
That is a great story. Yes, she was right. How did you hear about that story?

21:41:02&nbsp;
Lisa
Very interesting Dana!

21:41:08&nbsp;
Dana B
My husband's from Spain. His mom was a kid during the Spanish Civil War. Lots of famine after that, but everyone had a chicken or two.

21:42:19&nbsp;
Lisa
I want to visit Spain!! Berlin, Germany is my next big trip, but I'll make it to Spain some day!

21:42:45&nbsp;
Dana B
Yes, it's lovely -- and wonderful fruits and vegetables. Have fun in Berlin!

21:43:14&nbsp;
kristina
Plants need calcium to thrive just like humans. It goes to show you just how low the nutrient levels are in most water sources today.

21:43:38&nbsp;
Dana B
so calcium supplements aren't as good a source?

21:43:46&nbsp;
Lisa
Thanks Dana! I heard that they make enema bags in Germany! I'll but one there!

21:44:07&nbsp;
Lisa
I mean buy one there!

21:44:51&nbsp;
michael b
so many civil wars just everywhere. i starting to think humans are a flawed species, but i am not giving up.

21:45:28&nbsp;
Dana B
there's more people caring for others than fighting a war at any given time. Gotta have hope.

21:46:15&nbsp;
Carol45
I've got a question about a rinse enema after a coffee one, or when you feel like one is necessary.  Should it be another high enema, or would using a bulb be sufficient?

21:46:18&nbsp;
Lisa
Raw milk and cheese is legal and popular in Europe! I'll eat well there!

21:46:25&nbsp;
kristina
All supplements need fillers, expedients and binders within them in order to be saleable. However, these &quot;extras&quot; can often be harmful to the body so you want the supplements you take to be as clean as possible. Eggshells fit the bill and they are cheap!

21:46:47&nbsp;
Dana B
cool. I'm on those eggshells tomorrow.

21:47:13&nbsp;
Dana B
ooh the cheese. you're gonna have fun.

21:48:09&nbsp;
michael b
some how i think most of the people on this forum don't give up.

21:48:23&nbsp;
kristina
Also, there are many different types of calcium on the market-calcium carbonate, calcium citrate and so on..

21:49:01&nbsp;
kristina
Calcium carbonate is the active ingredient in agricultural lime. It is a common substance found as rock in all parts of the world and is the main component of seashells and the shell of snails. It is usually the principal cause of hard water.

21:49:25&nbsp;
kristina
Calcium carbonate is not well used by everyone's body.

21:49:40&nbsp;
Dana B
how soon after the chat is it logged? I'd like my dad to read it.

21:49:55&nbsp;
kristina
If you are interested in knowing how well your body is doing with calcium, try having a hair tissue mineral analysis.

21:50:44&nbsp;
kristina
It varies due to how busy my webmaster is. I imagine it will be a while before this one is posted, but if you email me with his email address, I can send a log to him.

21:50:59&nbsp;
Dana B
ok, thanks! will do.

21:51:05&nbsp;
kristina
The next Live Chat will be on July 11th at 8p.m., CST. 

21:51:37&nbsp;
Dana B
Thanks everybody, it was fun chatting with you and have a good night.

21:51:41&nbsp;
Carol45
Looks like this time is working well. 

21:52:18&nbsp;
billythekid
I like the new time. I do suspect some are still having trouble with JAVA

21:52:23&nbsp;
Lisa
This was a good chat. This 8pm time is great!!

21:52:51&nbsp;
kristina
The vast majority of calcium carbonate used in the supplement industry is extracted by mining or quarrying. Pure calcium carbonate can be produced from a pure quarried source (usually marble) or it can be prepared by passing carbon dioxide into a solution of calcium hydroxide

21:53:39&nbsp;
Lisa
Dave is still having a hard time logging into the chat! This is too bad because he is good to have around here!

21:53:44&nbsp;
kristina
Eggshells are 95 percent calcium carbonate but they don't contain the fillers, expedients and binders that make the available calcium carbonate difficult for the body to absorb

21:54:11&nbsp;
Dana B
wow. my mother-in-law is going to say &quot;I told you so&quot;

21:54:35&nbsp;
kristina
Is anyone a computer whiz that could offer Dave a hand with his JAVA? If so, let him know on the forum. 

21:54:56&nbsp;
kristina
Dana, it sure would be great to hear from you on the colon health forum, too. It has been a real joy to chat with you today. 

21:56:02&nbsp;
kristina
And, of course, it have been great to have all of you here. I am going to sign off now because I have been typing all day and my fingers are starting to ache. No good since I will be typing for days to come with the details of my new site needing attention. Mike, are you still using Dragon Naturally Speaking? I never was able to use it.

21:56:22&nbsp;
kristina
Say hello to your mother-in-law from me!

21:56:26&nbsp;
Carol45
Everyone have a good month - see you in July. *choochoo* 

21:56:27&nbsp;
Dana B
Bye!

21:56:36&nbsp;
kristina
Good-bye ALL!

21:56:43&nbsp;
kristina
Oh, Mike is gone...

21:56:46&nbsp;
billythekid
Good Bye

21:58:23&nbsp;
michael b
it was also difficult for me to get into the chat ,i just kept bouncing around,i some how got in.

21:59:09&nbsp;
Lisa
Gute Nacht! Good night!

21:59:28&nbsp;
Carol45
Glad you made it michael.  

22:00:51&nbsp;
michael b
its aufverdersehen liebchen.

22:02:17&nbsp;
michael b
bye now
