20:01:41&nbsp;
kristina
One of the topics that I am going to put forward tonight is the basics of good health.

20:02:20&nbsp;
kristina
I also wish to hear from you all. What do you believe is foundational for good health?

20:02:33&nbsp;
kristina
What of those things do you practice and how?

20:02:43&nbsp;
kristina
What of those things don't you practice and why?

20:03:07&nbsp;
kristina
I think we can all agree that a regular colon cleanse is a cornerstone of good health.

20:03:59&nbsp;
kristina
How often is optimal to cleanse the colon and with what solutions? are questions that I hear all of the time.

20:04:06&nbsp;
kristina
What do you all think? 

20:04:31&nbsp;
kristina
And, of course, what questions, stories or experiences are on your own minds that you would like to share tonight?

20:05:25&nbsp;
Cherie
Monday I went home sick.    I did an enema right away each day until today.  I am finally feeling better

20:05:35&nbsp;
kristina
It seems, as with many ways of life, how often one needs to cleanse the colon is best answered on an individual basis.

20:05:44&nbsp;
kristina
That is great, Cherie.

20:05:56&nbsp;
Cherie
I was wondering if I need to do this for a couple more days just be be safe

20:06:03&nbsp;
Lisa
I think a colon cleanse every other week is a good idea, but I don't always practice what I preach! 

20:06:16&nbsp;
kristina
After you took the enemas did you feel better right away or would you feel worse?

20:06:30&nbsp;
Cherie
monday i felt worse

20:06:36&nbsp;
kristina
I would recommend that you keep up with the daily enema for a few more days. 

20:06:50&nbsp;
Dave
Couple of my therapists and I would say good food, exercise and overall good health habits. BTW, both have discovered a weekly enema is helpful too.

20:07:24&nbsp;
Cherie
I have changed to eating more veggies so I am probably detoxing too

20:07:26&nbsp;
kristina
It is a tough time of year, with all of the weather changes, and assisting the body with its detoxification processes is smart.

20:07:57&nbsp;
kristina
And, as you say, changing one's eating habits can shift the body into a cleansing response. 

20:08:10&nbsp;
kristina
Are you using a coffee enema with your enema series?

20:08:41&nbsp;
Cherie
no, it makes me too jittery,  I use a small amount of lemon or epsom salts

20:08:57&nbsp;
kristina
Fine.

20:09:19&nbsp;
kristina
If you did use coffee, you would only want to use 1 tablespoon to 1 cup.

20:09:36&nbsp;
jumper
Getting a little long in the tooth, I have found that an enema is more comforting than just being therapeutic.  Maybe it's the fact that I don't have to beat myself to death as I did forty years ago.

20:10:06&nbsp;
kristina
Are you using coconut oil, extra olive oil, or any other healthy fats to assist you through this dietary change?

20:10:32&nbsp;
Cherie
Flax seed oil and extra virgin olive oil

20:10:34&nbsp;
kristina
Enemas are healthy.

20:10:48&nbsp;
Cherie
I also just got some chia seeds today.  

20:10:50&nbsp;
kristina
Might I suggest you add a bit of coconut oil? Also, have you tried raw dairy?

20:11:15&nbsp;
Dave
Both therapists are in their early 30s, so the as-needed enema  had gone out of style as kids, so they are newbies comparatively

20:11:35&nbsp;
kristina
Therapeutic amounts of raw fats draw toxins out of the cells.

20:11:40&nbsp;
Cherie
I have tried raw milk, I am not a milk drinker but will use it if I am having cereal which is a rare thing

20:12:25&nbsp;
kristina
I bet you are a good influence on those colon therapists.

20:12:53&nbsp;
kristina
Okay, so hear are more ideas for living a healthy life:

20:13:03&nbsp;
kristina
Make sure you have strong digestion.

20:13:28&nbsp;
Dave
Well, I have the early experience, LOL.

20:13:40&nbsp;
kristina
No purple pills, antacids, or stomach burning allowed. Strong digestion and stomach acid production are essential to good health.

20:14:15&nbsp;
Cherie
I have taken HCL now for a couple months and that is helping me and my husband

20:14:42&nbsp;
kristina
Excellent, Cherie!

20:15:30&nbsp;
kristina
Many of us need to increase the hydrochloric acid and pepsin in the stomach.

20:15:52&nbsp;
kristina
We also need to drink at least 2-3 ounces of water every 15-20 minutes.

20:16:05&nbsp;
kristina
If not 4-5 ounces.

20:16:14&nbsp;
Dave
Cherie, are you a &quot;late bloomer&quot; with enemas,  which I guess may be a growing trend?

20:16:39&nbsp;
Cherie
I don't know what  you mean?

20:17:01&nbsp;
kristina
Also, the appropriate amount of essential fatty acids is key to good digestion.

20:17:30&nbsp;
Lisa
I may be going to Paris for the first time this fall, if I can really afford it. It will be so nice to be in a country where they serve raw dairy like cheese. And it's legal there. This will be a trip I can eat healthy, and that's  hard to do in the USA.

20:17:45&nbsp;
kristina
Dave, are you trying to say that you had enemas as a kid and you find that most people don't start enemas until they are well into their adulthood?

20:17:58&nbsp;
kristina
Exciting, Lisa.

20:18:14&nbsp;
Cherie
Lisa that is great.  I would love to try some raw cheese.  

20:18:15&nbsp;
Lisa
I could come back feeling healthy and learn so much about what the French do to keep healthy.

20:18:35&nbsp;
kristina
Next, as I write about in my #1 health tip ... 

20:19:06&nbsp;
kristina
we need to keep our blood sugar well-balanced throughout each and every day.

20:19:19&nbsp;
kristina
Good health means no sweet or carb cravings.

20:20:01&nbsp;
kristina
In other words, we do not want to stress the &quot;fuel pump&quot; (cortisol) / &quot;fuel injection&quot; (insulin) system.

20:20:33&nbsp;
Cherie
I have now gone 3 days without bread or sweets because I was sick.  It makes me realize how addicted I am to them

20:20:37&nbsp;
Lisa
I don't feel healthy anymore. Of course I need to improve my health now.

20:20:37&nbsp;
kristina
Using the Ten Day Diet is one of the main healthy guides to good eating

20:21:11&nbsp;
kristina
It is best to graze, or to eat every 2 hours than it is to eat 3 meals a day. It is important not to skip breakfast.

20:21:40&nbsp;
kristina
Well, Lisa, maybe this will be another chance for us to work together. I am sorry that you don't feel so healthy anymore.

20:21:57&nbsp;
kristina
Well done, Cherie. That is a huge deal.

20:22:18&nbsp;
Lisa
Thanks Kris! I get headaches, and feel jumpy. 

20:23:19&nbsp;
kristina
If you need additional support, the herb Gymnema works well to &quot;reset&quot; the pancreas and curb and even eliminate carb cravings.

20:23:51&nbsp;
Lisa
I have to admit, I haven't been trying very hard, and I know I'm eating the wrong things. I need to get back into good habits like I was doing before.

20:24:08&nbsp;
kristina
Also, cherish those emotions that come along with this healing process. I recently am working through another layer of addiction. I have found a whole new layer of loneliness.

20:24:33&nbsp;
kristina
Looks like you could use some support, Lisa.

20:24:58&nbsp;
kristina
Okay, next, we must manage our stress, both externally and internally.

20:25:23&nbsp;
kristina
We need our bodies to NOT be involved in a prolonged stress response or pregnenolone steal.

20:25:42&nbsp;
Cherie
What steal?

20:25:50&nbsp;
Paul P
i know when i take enemas it sure make me feel real good

20:25:55&nbsp;
Joseph
hello kris, :)

20:26:21&nbsp;
Paul P
u feel like a new person

20:26:36&nbsp;
kristina
Pregnenolone is a steroid hormone

20:27:21&nbsp;
Cherie
sometimes after an enema you feel like you have just stirred the muddy waters

20:27:56&nbsp;
kristina
Pregnenolone is used by the body to make progesterone, mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, androgens, and estrogens.

20:28:14&nbsp;
Paul P
but if u do 3 of them u almost have 1 clear 

20:28:18&nbsp;
kristina
If your body uses it to handle stress, you have health problems.

20:28:25&nbsp;
Cherie
anything to do with the thyroid?

20:28:44&nbsp;
kristina
Glad to hear that enemas help you feel great, Paul.

20:28:57&nbsp;
kristina
Yes!

20:29:00&nbsp;
Paul P
it sure does

20:29:19&nbsp;
kristina
All the hormones and glands have to do with all the other hormones and glands. You can think of the entire system as a family.

20:29:56&nbsp;
Paul P
and the weight loss is good to 

20:29:59&nbsp;
Dave
Sorry for delay, was called  to phone. Meant that there's a gneration gap regarding traditional home enemas and now.

20:30:21&nbsp;
Cherie
There sure is Dave

20:30:58&nbsp;
Cherie
I did not know about them until my husband explained them to me after a year or 2 of marriage.

20:31:00&nbsp;
kristina
The steroid hormones govern sexual health, fertility, reproduction and stress management. 

20:31:05&nbsp;
Paul P
u will both feel good

20:31:19&nbsp;
kristina
They directly influence energy, stamina, vitality, mood, cognition and memory.

20:33:02&nbsp;
kristina
One reason for the raw dairy and healthy fat is to assist with hormone health.

20:33:21&nbsp;
kristina
This family of steroid hormones is made from cholesterol.

20:33:38&nbsp;
Cherie
my thyroid took over the family.  It was hyper, most was taken out at the age of 17 and it grew back and it was radiated

20:33:50&nbsp;
kristina
Yikes!

20:33:56&nbsp;
kristina
How has your health been since?

20:34:06&nbsp;
kristina
What happened when you were a teenager?

20:34:39&nbsp;
kristina
Okay, another cornerstone of good health is hormone metabolism and elimination. 

20:34:53&nbsp;
kristina
this is controlled by the liver and gallbladder function.

20:35:06&nbsp;
kristina
You must have good bile flow.

20:35:17&nbsp;
Cherie
I felt well after the first surgery, no pills needed.  After the second it stablized and then would not stay in any range.  I was very sick

20:35:28&nbsp;
kristina
I am sorry.

20:35:36&nbsp;
Katy
How do I know if I have good bile flow

20:35:58&nbsp;
kristina
Enemas, especially coffee enemas, are excellent tool to assist one's bile flow.

20:36:18&nbsp;
Cherie
After 7 years of being very ill and eliminating many different foods, i took all soy out of my diet and it leveled in 2 weeks!

20:36:38&nbsp;
Cherie
so now I am rebuilding

20:36:43&nbsp;
kristina
Wow! That is quite a story.

20:36:47&nbsp;
kristina
How old are you now?

20:36:50&nbsp;
Cherie
46

20:36:53&nbsp;
Joseph
I was feeling ill monday, and took a 2 qt. goldenseal solution, I feel great today.

20:37:00&nbsp;
kristina
Daily bowel movements.

20:37:05&nbsp;
Cherie
yes

20:37:13&nbsp;
kristina
Well colored stools.

20:37:58&nbsp;
Cherie
that has changed with my diet.  I added green smoothies and now it is medium color with some dark layers

20:40:24&nbsp;
razor
Is anyone using the delrin tip colon tube?

20:41:11&nbsp;
AlanH
Hi. I am an OH Client and have been using Coffee Enemas to reduce foot pain. I am trying to stop fine chewing tobacco, a 40 year habit, but withdrawal is always stopped. The coffee enemas have stopped this. Is there anything to this?

20:41:22&nbsp;
kristina
when you eat fats, you don't want to be burping. if you are you know that the gallbladder is not transporting and using of fats well.

20:41:35&nbsp;
kristina
Also, daily bowel movements and well colored stools.

20:41:58&nbsp;
razor
by well colored do you mean even color?

20:42:40&nbsp;
Katy
ok, I had the burping and pain over gallbladder area but it has been gone since eating grapefruit daily. 

20:42:54&nbsp;
kristina
As I write in my book, Ten Days to Optimal Health, bile, from the gallbladder, is your main tool for carrying the nicotine and other toxins out of your body in these two weeks. Colon cleansing, and particularly coffee enemas, increase the flow of bile out of your body. Thus, if you are quitting smoking, take coffee enemas, after your cleansing enemas, one to seven times per week. Once the nicotine is out of the body, all physical withdrawal will cease.

20:43:18&nbsp;
kristina
Ten Days to Optimal Health

20:43:24&nbsp;
watsum
Does anyone seem to urinate more after an enema - ?  I seem to

20:43:43&nbsp;
kristina
hmmm.. grapefruit? Do you know why?

20:43:57&nbsp;
kristina
This is normal as water is absorbed through the colon.

20:44:21&nbsp;
razor
if you use sea salt it seems to reduce the absorption

20:44:27&nbsp;
kristina
yes, this is true.

20:44:48&nbsp;
Katy
I'm not sure but guessing the acid?

20:45:02&nbsp;
AlanH
Thank you. I will continue the coffee enema program. So far there has been no urge for me to buy another can. I am worried about future health issues

20:45:24&nbsp;
razor
I find the salt also helps retention thus better volume intake

20:45:58&nbsp;
kristina
Well done, Alan, this is a really big deal. You have a lot to be proud of. I will share the rest of what I write in my book about coming off nicotine:

20:46:04&nbsp;
kristina
During the initial two weeks and after, it is important to realize that stress has a physiological effect on the body, 

20:46:17&nbsp;
kristina
which increases the desire for cigarettes. Stress makes the urine acidic. Whenever the urine becomes acidic, the body excretes more nicotine. Thus, when a smoker encounters a stressful situation, he excretes more nicotine and goes into withdrawal.

20:46:28&nbsp;
kristina
Most smokers feel that when they are nervous or upset, cigarettes help calm them down. The calming effect from cigarettes is not relief from the emotional strain of a situation, but actually the effect of replenishing the nicotine supply and ending the withdrawal. During stressful times, take more coffee enemas. During stressful times, find a friend who can listen to you rant and rave about the stressful situation. During stressful times, play a musical instrument. During stressful times, take a long walk in a favorite spot and cry. And do try to diminish the amount of stress that you are under when you take on quitting smoking. And it is fine to take on quitting smoking a week or two into the program. Always remember that your goal is to be successful. With small and steadfast steps, you will be successful!

20:47:10&nbsp;
Lisa
Like Dave, I got a phone call too, so I now need to catch up!

20:47:18&nbsp;
kristina
Stool color can vary based on what vegetables we eat mostly but the base color of the stool is optimally light brown.

20:47:40&nbsp;
kristina
Red with beets is healthy. Beets can be very helpful in improving gallbladder function.

20:47:55&nbsp;
kristina
At the OHC, we use a product called AF Betafood by Standard Process:

20:48:01&nbsp;
Dave
Sorry, security provider decided to throw me offline for upgrades.

20:48:16&nbsp;
AlanH
This is not smoking, but chewing. It has the same affect, I think. 

20:48:51&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, I just copy and pasted what is in my book but the same principles apply.

20:48:55&nbsp;
watsum
I have been using just my fingers to pinch the hose to control the water flow with the enema - just an idea - is this ok?  Seems to work well for me

20:49:42&nbsp;
kristina
Just fine.

20:50:03&nbsp;
kristina
Enema hose clamps are great but if you don't want to use one you certainly don't have to.

20:50:09&nbsp;
Dave
I am depending on transcript to catch up Lisa, LOL.

20:50:24&nbsp;
kristina
hose clamps

20:51:13&nbsp;

I am considering starting a once a month live chat that would happen during the day. I would still do this live chat on the second Tuesday of the month. Let me know if you are interested in a monthly daytime chat.

20:51:30&nbsp;
razor
I use the flowmaster system and with that I don't usually even use my clamp once I start

20:51:48&nbsp;
kristina
We tend to post the live chat on the website within a few days after the actual event.

20:52:05&nbsp;
Katy
Yes, I would be interested in another Chat during the day.

20:52:11&nbsp;
Cherie
Earlier in the day I am not available to do this

20:52:44&nbsp;
AlanH
I would be interested in the Day Chat

20:52:54&nbsp;
razor
I would join in a daytime chat

20:53:09&nbsp;
Lisa
Most people work during the day!

20:53:15&nbsp;
Dave
I like the plastic ratchet clamp. Was started off many years ago with the metal snap clamp.

20:53:46&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, the Ramp clamp is excellent.

20:53:54&nbsp;
Dave
I am good for a day chat, generally speaking.

20:53:56&nbsp;
Katy
Great that you are able Lisa!

20:54:02&nbsp;
watsum
I am ok with the day time chat - anytime.   Bifidonate powder - is this important to use and how often - ?  I am still so new to this. 

20:54:18&nbsp;
AlanH
It is hard for me to get on in time at night because of Wednesday night church

20:54:40&nbsp;
Lisa
I don't think I can make it during the day, but maybe sometimes I can.

20:54:53&nbsp;
kristina
I will do both chats but I will start a second chat each month on the 4th Wednesday at noon, central standard time.

20:55:42&nbsp;
Katy
Does that start this month on the 25th?

20:56:01&nbsp;
kristina
This will also allow people who live in Europe and other countries with very different time zones to join in. Our first daytime live chat will be on March 25th. I will send out an announcement, also.

20:56:06&nbsp;

sounds great kris

20:56:22&nbsp;

Any last thoughts?

20:56:24&nbsp;
watsum
Thanks for everyone's time - thinking and hoping for spring - goodnight

20:56:27&nbsp;
kristina
did I miss any questions?

20:58:21&nbsp;
watsum
Should bifidonate be used often?

20:58:35&nbsp;
kristina
I am starting my next book. I welcome input into what you all want to see me write about. Please be bold and forthcoming.

20:59:28&nbsp;
Katy
Great, thanks for asking. 

20:59:31&nbsp;
kristina
Also, we are going to being putting up a history of enemas on enembag.com so if any of you are aware of pictures, medical books, internet sites, magazines, etc that could help us develop this archive, please do send them my way.

20:59:57&nbsp;
kristina
One needs to make sure they have an abundance of healthy flora in their digestive tract.

21:00:41&nbsp;
kristina
Bifidonate is an important part of that healthy flora. For some, it can't be overused but it isn't the only probiotic that I would use on a regular basis.

21:00:53&nbsp;
kristina
Gotta go. See you all soon. Feel free to email.
