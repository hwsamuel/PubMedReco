Hey Dave. How are you?

20:04:37
Dave
pretty good. I got bitten by a deer tick. on antibiotic along with blood thinner for heart. tricky combo.

20:04:42
kristina
Hey folks, welcome! Go ahead and let's get started with what's on your minds tonight.

20:04:55
kristina
I'd say, Dave. How are you feeling?

20:05:21
kristina
When did you get bitten by a deer tick? How did you find it? Where? 

20:06:00
Dave
Fine, just have to watch what I eat so doesn't affect the balance.

20:07:01
tomiowa
good evening from the northwoods of Wisconsin

20:07:03
kristina
did anyone have a difficult time entering the chat room today?

20:07:14
clydee
no

20:07:21
kristina
Good evening!

20:07:26
tomiowa
I got kicked out the first time but tried again with no problem

20:07:47
kristina
Dave, how did you know you were bitten by a deer tick?

20:07:53
clydee
evening Kristina:  received my order today.

20:09:10
tomiowa
last month I got dropped and could not sign back in. It said my login was already in use.

Lyme Disease, in the United States, may be affecting millions of people. Some believe that Lyme Disease is the underlying causative agent of many chronic health conditions, including but not limited to: allergies, heart arrhythmias, arthritis (both osteo and rheumatoid), ADD, auto-immune disorders, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, depression, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, macular degeneration, sensory or motor radiculoneuropathies (i.e., clumsiness in the hands or feet and/or burning, tingling or numbness), Alzheimer's Disease, ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease), Bell's palsy, irritable bowel syndrome and gastrointestinal distress, lupus, polymyalgia rheumatica (a more severe form of fibromyalgia), sleep disorders, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, brain fog, memory loss, joint pain/swelling/stiffness, lack of coordination, unexplained chills and fevers, recurrent infections, poor concentration, tremors, shortness of breath, anxiety or panic attacks, heart palpitations, weight changes (loss or gain), sore throats, loss of appetite, muscle pain or cramps, obsessive compulsive disorders, headaches/migraines, light sensitivity, trigeminal neuralgia, unexplained hair loss, and visual changes.

20:09:50
kristina
Great, Clydee! Anything specific you want to say about that? What did you receive?

20:10:31
Dave
Re tick, i volunteer at a park, but largely inside, so a visitor must have been a carrier. Swelling in upper leg and the critter visible. Dermatologist extracted it. Want some of our spare deer? We have many. many!

20:10:37
kristina
a recent study demonstrated the efficacy of Cat's Claw (Unicaria tomentosa) in destroying the Lyme organism. In fact, in the study, the control group of 14 patients all took antibiotics and only 3 improved slightly, 3 got worse and the remainder had no change in their clinical condition. The experimental group was treated with Cat's Claw and 85% of them were negative for the Lyme organism after 6 months and all the patients experienced a dramatic improvement in their clinical condition. (Cowden, WE, MD, et al., &quot;Lyme Disease: Nutraceutical Breakthrough Using TOA-Free Cat's Claw&quot;, Focus, Feb '04, pp.3,4) In utilizing Cat's Claw, it is extremely important that the quality and purity of the product be assured. This herb occurs naturally in 2 forms: the more common TOA form and the rarer POA form. For those of you with a chemical bent, TOA stands for tetracyclic oxindole alkaloid and POA for pentacyclic oxindole alkaloid. Only the POA form is effective in stimulating the immunity which destroys the organism. As little as 1% TOA can cause a 30% reduction in the immune system modulating properties that POAs provide. Unfortunately some commercially available products contain as much as 80% TOAs. (Ibid, p. 3) The Medi-Herb Cat's Claw that we use at the RFHC is 1.5% to 2.0% POAs, the highest concentration available, and is TOA free. Therefore, the amount needed is less, making it much more affordable than other POA products on the market. We did a cost study and determined that using Medi-Herb Cat's Claw was very cost effective. ($60 for a month's supply vs. $325 for a month's supply from the other retailer.) 

20:10:56
kristina
No thanks!

20:12:09
clydee
I ordered the air pump pillows and castile soap and the catheter with the retention bulb.

20:12:11
kristina

I have heard a lot about Lyme here in Texas, but never had any idea so many things are/can be attibuted to Lyme.

20:14:05
tomiowa
They're reporting bad ticks in Wisconsin, but so far we've been OK and hope to keep it that way. My home state of Arkansas knows how to grow them as well.

20:14:20
kristina
There are so many more symptoms, but let's go on to treatment:

20:14:23
kristina
High protein, high fat, low carb diet with vegetables (modified elimination diet). Avoid artificial sweeteners. Drink lots of pure water. Quality essential fatty acids are critical.

20:14:32
kristina
 Probiotics to maintain normal bowel flora.

20:14:57
kristina
Gall bladder flushes (use hot lemon tea to maintain gall bladder function) and a beet supplement such as AF BetaFood.

20:15:43
Debbie
hi everyone

20:15:47
kristina
Daily colon cleanse using our Core Restore Kit

20:16:00
clydee
What if a person does not have a gall bladder?

20:16:03
kristina
Hi Debbie!

20:16:17
kristina
Good question.

20:16:46
clydee
Would a liver cleanse be of benefit?

20:16:55
tomiowa
have really liked the new longer colon tube

20:17:13
clydee
The 60&quot;?

20:17:30
Debbie
does colon cleansing help down to the cellular level by helping purify the blood?

20:17:37
tomiowa
yes the 60&quot; in 32fr  

20:17:51
kristina
You still need to help the body prevent accumulation of fat in the liver.

20:17:58
Debbie
How?

20:17:59
kristina
For this, we use bile salts.

20:18:11
Debbie
like celtic salt

20:18:58
kristina
No, we work with Cholacol, which contains Collinsonia root and purified bovine bile salts.

20:19:17
Debbie
is this put into the colonic or coffee enema?

20:19:19
tomiowa
Also started using my new 1-gallon enema bucket since last month. works really well and easy to clean up.

20:20:16
kristina
You also want to use other liptrophic agents like beets because they have the lipotrophic agent betaine.  Vitamin A also has an important effect on lipid metabolism.

20:20:29
Debbie
I was just told I have sclerdoma.

20:20:58
kristina
Glad to hear, tomiowa! I find those 4 quart stainless steel enema buckets to be a dream to work with to cleanse the colon.

20:21:00
tomiowa
have you ever heard of lymphadema?

20:21:11
Dave
Does the gallon bucket's weight require IV pole?

20:21:21
kristina
stainless steel enema buckets

20:21:45
tomiowa
no pole - just either hang from its bail or set on shelf if there is one

20:22:15
kristina
It can be hung or set somewhere. The enema bucket isn't much heavier than any of our 4 quart enema bags, so generally no, but I don't know your personal set-up.

20:22:57
Dave
Just like the standard 2-qt enema can?

20:23:32
kristina
Yes, I have heard of lymphadema. Do you have lymphatic obstruction?

20:23:36
tomiowa
It drains out very well with the new buckets. Drain tap is lower than the 2 qt. I have both. My sister was told that was her problem with her lower leg swelling issues.

20:24:43
kristina
How severe is her situation?  What does she eat? How much does she move?

20:24:55
tomiowa
They tell it's in our genes and others in family could have it.  I currently don't think I have any issues with it.

20:25:39
clydee
Does she sit for long periods of time?

20:25:46
tomiowa
She has had times her legs almost double in size.  She's a teacher and does not move around large amounts because her knees are bad.

20:25:58
kristina
The spleen, an organ in the lymphatic system, is usually underfunctioning.

20:26:23
kristina
For this, we recommend a dessicated spleen from bovine and ovine sources.

20:26:49
Debbie
what if someone doesn't have a spleen? what can they do?

20:26:52
tomiowa
explain that one

20:27:28
michael b
a most splendid evening to everyone here at this chat. i'm enjoying all of this chat.

20:28:08
tomiowa
how do you dessicate a spleen?

20:28:12
kristina
Once you have had a splenectomy, you will be more prone to infections and your body will not fight them as easily.

20:28:20
Debbie
thanks, but I am still wondering if there is anything to help with scleroderma...

20:29:12
kristina
Absolutely!

20:29:36
Debbie
Like when I feel like I am going to die

20:29:45
clydee
Debbie, I have information that may help with the scleroderma.  Let me check in my library.

20:29:58
kristina
Scleroderma is a chronic autoimmune disease, so we first work on stopping the body from recognizing itself as a problem, at all levels!

20:30:14
Debbie
How? HELP!!

20:31:25
kristina
We need to boost immune function with herbs. If you were working with me, I would explore using large quantities of echinacea, probiotics, herbal adaptogens, and herbal tonics.

20:32:01
Debbie
I kind of am but I will call you and continue with your suggestions.

20:32:09
kristina
Debbie, can you talk more about the details? How long has this been going on? Exactly what are your symptoms?

20:32:37
kristina
Do you have limited systemic sclerosis/scleroderma or diffuse systemic sclerosis/scleroderma?

20:32:38
Debbie
15 years, severe fatigue and pain

20:33:19
Debbie
I don't know the difference. I have been in shock since I found out on Friday.

20:33:33
clydee
The book for reference is A Physician's Guide to Natural Health Products.  By James A. Howenstine, MD.  ISBN  978-0--9705684-9-6

20:33:45
kristina
Well, first of all, thanks for keeping up the fight. I can only imagine how hard this process has been and continues to be for you. A huge ouch! I hope you are finding lots of opportunities to cry and rage.

20:34:28
Debbie
None. I stay in my room and hide so no one sees me. I look too gloomy to be around people.

20:35:21
kristina
Sorry.

20:35:23
Debbie
Thanks Clydee.

20:35:23
clydee
The product is Sterinol   - The Immune System Cure  - Prentice Hall 1999.

20:35:38
kristina
Gotu kola (Centella asiatica ) is a member of the Apiaceae carrot family and another herb we may or may not use. It is also called pennywort, marsh penny, water pennywort, and sheep rot.

20:36:24
Debbie
what is it used for:

20:36:49
kristina
Sterinol: Product Description   - Balances the Body's Immune System. For optimum health, your body relies on a properly functioning immune system. Two naturally-ocurring plant compounds, sterols and sterolins, have been found to provide significant immune-regulating benefits. Even though they are widely distributed in fruits and vegetables, few people consume sufficient quantities of these foods to achieve maximum benifits. Exciting new clinical research published by leading immunologist, Prof. P. Bouic, Ph.D, demonstrates that supplementation with the patented combination of sterols and sterolins found in Moducare Sterinol can play an important role in optimizing your body's immune function.

20:37:32
kristina
The herbs contain the sterols and the sterolins, along with a whole host of other beneficial substances

20:37:38
Debbie
is this an obtainable item?

20:37:53
clydee
The correct spelling is &quot;scleroderma.&quot;

20:38:26
Debbie
thanks. I get very crossed with talking and spelling when I am tired

20:38:36
kristina
I am not recommending it as I don't think you will find it to be a cure-all. However, using a more wholistic approach can offer you a complete recovery.

20:39:00
Debbie
May I call you tomorrow?

20:40:06
kristina
Sterols are an important class of organic molecules. They occur naturally in plants, animals, and fungi, with the most familiar type of animal sterol being cholesterol. (one reason people's bodies tend to raise the cholesterol levels.)

20:41:06
Debbie
Our levels rise to protect us??

20:41:25
kristina
Yes. Please do call the office. The office is closing next week for staff vacations; the website and all the products are still available so we are pretty swamped right now, but if you call in the morning to set up an appointment and/or to order some product, I will make sure we fit you in. Just let DeeDee know that I told you this.

20:41:35
kristina
yes

20:42:00
kristina
just fine that you get crossed.

20:42:23
clydee
On page 239 it states, &quot;Recovery merits a trail in scleroderma as we are aware of a patient who developed significant improvement over an 18 month trial of Recovery.  It is from a Canadian company, Biomedica Laboratories, Inc.

20:42:42
kristina
Sterols of plants are called phytosterols and sterols of animals are called zoosterols. Important zoosterols are cholesterol and some steroid hormones; notable phytosterols include campesterol, sitosterol, and stigmasterol. Ergosterol is a sterol present in the cell membrane of fungi, where it serves a role similar to cholesterol in animal cells.

20:43:53
kristina
I continually have found, through the years, that to extract one type of molecule from a plant or animal to use in therapeutic dosages is never as effective as using the whole plant or eating the meat of animals. I do agree sterols and sterolins are highly therapeutic.

20:44:46
Debbie
I will call with this issue tomorrow am and hopefully will be able to have some protocol set up. 

20:45:08
kristina
Recovery time will likely be quicker using the whole plant.

20:45:31
kristina
Okay, any other threads tonight, not to stop this thread, of course!?

20:45:47
clydee
Recovery is also called Nutracol and is derived from green tea and grapes.  It reduces the breakdown of collagen fibers and neutralizes free radicals....

20:47:30
kristina
I am going to list this doctor's suggested treatments for Lyme Disease to give folks a chance to see just what sort of commitment it can take to heal the body sometimes:

20:47:40
kristina
TREATMENT CONSIDERATIONS 1. Kill the bugs a. May include long-term antibiotic therapy b. May include traditional Chinese medicine c. May include long-term Western herbal therapy (Cat's Claw, Wormwood, Echinacea Premium and Sarsaparilla) d. Homeopathy e. Orthomolecular nutrition f. Heat treatment to increase cellular activity (diathermy, spa, sauna) g. May include electromagnetic therapies, such as Rife machines 2. Open the pathways of elimination to deal with aggravation of the die-off of organisms, or Herxheimer reaction a. Lymph massage b. Exercise to increase lymph movement c. Skin brushing d. Chi gong, yoga, etc e. High protein, high fat, low carb diet with vegetables (modified elimination diet). Avoid artificial sweeteners. Drink lots of pure water. Quality essential fatty acids are critical. f. Maintain alkalinity via supplements or bicarbonate. Supplements include buffered Vitamin C to bowel tolerance, green drink, Chlorophyll Perles (Standard Process). See Alkaline Broth recipe, attached. 3. Drain the lymph, liver and gall bladder and clear the colon to clear the body of TNF alpha and neurotoxins, along with heavy metals a. Probiotics to maintain normal bowel flora b. Gall bladder flushes (use hot lemon tea to maintain gall bladder function) c. Daily doses of colon cleanse (psyllium with betonite clay) d. Coffee enemas (I personally do not recommend) 4. Circulate the blood and make it less viscous a. Enzyme therapy to reduce rouleau formation b. Trace Minerals concentrate with a couple grains of high quality cayenne to enhance circulation to extremities. The warming herb helps balance the cold effect of Cat's Claw. c. Ginko biloba to open capillary beds 5. Regulate the immune system to target the organisms and lower the inflammatory responses, keep the body alkaline a. Chlorophyll extract from green leafy vegetables b. A green drink or Alkaline Broth 6. Maintain body temperature at 98.6ºF a. Support thyroid function, as needed (Thyroid Complex/Medi-Herb) 7. Eliminate stressors

20:48:26
kristina
FYI - we at the Optimal Health Center are practiced at most of these tools.

20:48:58
kristina
Debbie, you could call right after this chat is over, if you wish. 608-242-0200.

20:49:15
Debbie
Thank you - I will!

20:49:56
michael b
to my understanding, the spleen is important to living. for me with my petty problems, it's great to see help available, if only online.

20:50:30
emaples
Kristina,  sorry I have been so slow in joining the chat group but due to farming commiting it has been a fast spring and is still going.  I play golf every morning so will join when I can.

20:51:30
kristina
Joining us for any time for any length is always great.

20:51:31
Dave
Fortunately, my critter seems not to have been a  Lyme carrier. No tell-tale &quot;target&quot; etc. on the wound.

20:52:12
kristina
Next live chat will be canceled (June 23rd at 12 noon) as I will just be returning from Colorado. 

20:52:16
clydee
For any immune disorder these four may help.  Selenium improves immune function, systeine improves glutathione levels, glutamine restores muscle mass, and tryptophane is an essential amino acid.

20:52:47
kristina
So, our next live chat will be at 7pm on July 14th. I hope to see many of you there! Invite your friends, facebook buddies, family! 

20:53:08
kristina
Great, Dave!

20:53:19
