Hello everyone! 

12:59:10
randyu
Hello all!  How is everyone?

12:59:45
DaveC
Hi all.

13:00:08
deedee
Welcome everyone!  I am finishing up with a client, but please start chatting and asking questions or let me know any subject you'd like to discuss today.

13:00:58
randyu
Can a colon hydro session be used solely as a prep for a colonoscopy, DeeDee?

13:02:27
jane.f
I cannot hear any voices.

13:03:11
randyu
There are no voices, a type chat only, Jane.  Are you new to this chat?  Welcome!

13:03:27
jane.f
Yes, I am new.

13:03:40
randyu
Any issues or things to discuss?  

13:03:49
DaveC
I was interested in DeeDee's observance in a previous chat that younger peole are discovering colon therapy decades after the therapy and the traditional enema fell out of favor.

13:04:29
randyu
Yes, but how are they finding that, Dave?  MD's don't really push it anymore; some nurses still do.

13:05:54
Victoria
Decades ago there was a lot of rectal pain associated with colonics. Is it painless today? 

13:05:56
DaveC
DeeDee would have to answer that, but maybe by checking out alternative medicine sites.

13:06:57
jane.f
My problem is severe eczema.  I just started eliminating all tree nuts from my diet.  I have been using coconut oil to lubricate my skin. Should I try another oil? 

13:08:21
deedee
Randy, yes, a colonic can be used to prep for medical procedures like colonoscopy.

13:09:29
deedee
I think with the internet, many people are discovering different ways to heal themselves and be preventative, so colon cleansing is coming back, so to say.

13:09:38
randyu
The regular prep is too harsh for me; made me weak last time.  MD wants me to have one again in 2 years, due to polyps.  That would be five years instead of 10.  Necessary, DeeDee?

13:10:45
deedee
Victoria, there should really be no pain with a colonic or enema at all.  There is some discomfort like pressure in the colon, but that should be it.  I do have people who are very unhealthy and they do have more discomfort initially, but it does get easier.

13:11:39
randyu
Enemas, if done right, should not hurt, only some pressure in the colon.

13:11:40
Peter N
Is it a good idea to do enemas while taking antibiotics to kill off SIBO (explain)? 

13:12:10
randyu
Correction:  only some MILD pressure in the colon when water is flowing in.

13:12:41
jane.f
I purchased an enema kit after watching your excellent videos. My husband I are still unsure. We live far away. Should we just be courageous and begin?

13:12:43
deedee
Jane, eczema and other skin conditions start internally.  So, if your digestive system is not working well, it comes out in the form of a skin issue in some people.  Looking at your diet and getting your flora in your digestive system healthier will help.

13:13:47
deedee
Yes, take enemas while   taking antibiotics.  Also, take probiotics, just opposite time of the day as you take the antibiotics.

13:14:22
deedee
Jane, if you feel more comfortable talking with me on the phone after the chat so you feel like you can begin the enemas, we can do that.

13:15:06
jane.f
Yes, DeeDee, my diet is excellent, but I have become super sensitive and it is difficult to identify the causes.

13:15:13
Peter N
Is it recommended to take enemas before and after the antibiotic treatment as well? Coffee or essential oils?

13:15:56
deedee
Has anyone noticed our new oil products testing kits that were in the newsletter and now on the website?

13:16:24
DaveC
Agree, from personal experience, antibiotics and &quot;good&quot; enemas go together, lol.

13:16:28
IaAlan
No, not yet.

13:16:44
deedee
We will be expanding on the categories as we go also, so if there is a certain ailment that you would like to see addressed, let me know.  We will be following with the prostate next I think.

13:17:08
jane.f
DeeDee, I will call you later today to chat about beginning enemas.

13:17:09
Victoria
There are many brands and different kinds of probiotics. I guess that refrigerated expensive raw kinds are better? 

13:17:35
jane.f
What is the best time to take a probiotic?

13:18:32
deedee
Victoria, not necessarily.  We have some that are made stable at room temperature.  I base the quality on the company and how high the count is and how many strains are included.

13:19:10
randyu
DeeDee, should I take enema for IBS if I have a flare-up of symptoms like bloating, more than normal, even if I have more than normal bowel movements?

13:19:13
deedee
I usually have people take a probiotic either right before bed, or right away in the morning on an empty stomach if they can.

13:19:39
DaveC
DeeDee, prostate issues would be very relevant to your &quot;veteran&quot; clients.

13:19:49
deedee
Randy, yes, an enema can help relieve those issues.

13:20:05
randyu
Just one enema or more?

13:20:08
jane.f
What should I look for in a vitamin C?

13:21:35
deedee
Jane, I believe a whole food supplement is best.  One that contains vitamins from a whole orange versus just ascorbic acid.

13:22:12
deedee
Randy, see if one enema helps first.  Add another if you need to.  Just use sea salt in the water.

13:22:39
jane.f
Best to get vitamins from food, I agree.

13:23:23
deedee
There are good lines of supplements that are made from whole food like Standard Process, which we carry.

13:23:24
randyu
Thanks DeeDee. I will give this a try.  I am due for a cleanse anyway.

13:24:12
deedee
Are all of you signed up for our newsletter?

13:24:29
jane.f
Not yet.

13:24:31
randyu
Enemas do help cleanse the system out.

13:25:31
deedee
Jane, we have an emailed monthly newsletter which is free and includes a coupon to be used at the end of the month and also contains tons of information and testimonials.   I think you would like it.

13:26:32
jane.f
Thanks, I will see about signing up.

13:27:46
Victoria
I hear that &quot;sea salt&quot; is very polluted now from radiation and chemicals. I think sea salt from a land-based ancient seabed like REAL SALT brand for one, is presumed clean. 

13:28:02
deedee
Jane, another good way to get your vitamin C - and it tastes great too - is to put a couple of drops of our Young Living essential oil Orange or Citrus Fresh into your water throughout the day.  

13:28:08
deedee
That is as pure and whole as you can get without eating a bunch of oranges!

13:28:27
DaveC
I think I receive it sporadically, but maybe that's just my problem.

13:29:16
deedee
Many times it is your browser or your spam filter that gets in the way.

13:30:48
jane.f
DeeDee, I have been avoiding citrus, since my flare-up with eczema. 

13:31:46
deedee
The following are links to our new oil products on the website: http://www.optimalhealthnetwork.com/Bacterial-Fungal-Parasite-Infections-Testing-Kit-s/1150.htm

13:32:04
deedee
http://www.optimalhealthnetwork.com/Leaky-Gut-Testing-Kit-s/1151.htm

13:32:47
deedee
These addressed Bacterial, Fungal, and Parasite Infections and Leaky Gut.

13:33:50
deedee
We have also found it helpful when doing essential oils in your enemas, to mix it around in some sea salt before mixing it with water.  This seems to disperse the oils better so that they do not float to the top of your enema bag.

13:33:58
deedee
You can also use them in the suppositories with the coconut oil.

13:35:17
jane.f
Please explain coffee vs. essential oil enemas.

13:35:28
deedee
Jane, I believe the oils would not be bad for you if taken internally, because they do not contain the acid part of the citrus.

13:36:09
jane.f
When are suppositories used?  Where do I get the ice cube tray (brand)?

13:36:10
deedee
Oils that are good for eczema are:  lavender, juniper, Roman chamomile, and geranium.

13:37:03
Victoria
I hear that adding 4 drops of Castile soap per quart of water, breaks up the surface tension. I like Green Label Castile soap.

13:37:38
deedee
Coffee and essential oils can be combined or taken separately.  Many people will do cleansing enemas (as per our recommendation) with essential oils in their cleansing water.  Usually 2-4 drops per quart depending on the oil.  

13:38:29
deedee
Coffee is taken in smaller amounts (2-4 cups) taken after the cleansing enemas and held for 15 min.  You can also add essential oils to your coffee for a deeper cleansing, detoxifying, and healing effect.

13:39:13
deedee
Yes, castile soap can also help with the oils.  We use Dr. Bronner's.

13:39:39
randyu
DeeDee, isn't just plain, warm, filtered sea salt water the best for cleanse?

13:39:58
deedee
Jane, all of the products (cube trays, etc) are on the webite.  There is also a video on how to make and use the suppositories.

13:40:21
jane.f
Can you recommend anything to relieve itching from eczema?

13:41:27
randyu
DeeDee, I meant if you are only taking one enema, then plain water with sea salt is best?

13:42:42
deedee
Sea salt plain is a great cleanse, but some people like to add therapeutic oils for extra benefit and effect.

13:43:02
jane.f
Where is the Castile soap used?

13:43:51
randyu
DeeDee, if I never had a colon hydro session, would it benefit me to try it?  It may clease deeper than I can do with enemas.

13:44:21
deedee
You can use the castile soap in the first cleansing enema.  1 tsp. of soap per quart is average.

13:45:20
deedee
Randy, a colonic can be beneficial for you to try, but only if you come and see me  --  ha ha, just kidding!  It is a good experience to have if you can do it.

13:47:05
randyu
I wish I could come out there and have you do a session for me, DeeDee, but there are 2 places nearby that do them here.  Neither one recommeds enemas like you do.  Why not?

13:47:31
DaveC
I'm a Bronner's fan myself, but traditional bar Ivory was a big favorite nationwide and beyond in older times.

13:48:17
jane.f
It's been years since I had a colonic, but I do remember feeling great after the treatment.  Can you explain why we may need to replace electrolytes after a colonic.  Is this true for enemas as well?

13:49:18
deedee
Colon therapists are told not to recommend enemas.

13:49:39
randyu
Why not?

13:51:22
DaveC
A threat to their business, to put it in blunt terms.

13:51:42
deedee
If you are only taking an enema or colonic once in a while, the electrolytes is not an issue, but if you are doing them more frequently, the water will disrupt the  mineral levels.  If you use sea salt in the water, this will take care of that.

13:51:57
Victoria
Who owns your body? You or the state? 

13:53:46
randyu
Sometimes I wonder, Victoria.  I wish more states would allow naturopath doctors to practice.  DeeDee, you agree?

13:53:55
deedee
I think more people are taking more control over their own bodies and their health  -  thank goodness!

13:55:21
deedee
I think insurance should cover preventative health more also.

13:56:14
jane.f
I am grateful to be connected with Optimal Health Network.  For over 25 years, I have been well since I have always looked for alternative healing.

13:56:20
randyu
So do I, DeeDee, and cover naturopath doctors too!  They don't in PA here.

13:57:00
jane.f
We need to push for health care vouchers.

13:57:01
Victoria
A professor said, &quot;that's how you tell if you live in a FREE country.&quot;

13:57:21
DaveC
One of my colon therapists routinely gives me a probiotic capsule at the end of the session, but more later would not hurt.

13:58:09
deedee
Yes, probiotics after sessions are good.  I have done that some in the past, but I think I will do that more in the future.

13:58:50
randyu
DeeDee, may we consult soon again by phone?

13:59:34
deedee
Is there anything else anyone has before we have to wrap it up?  Please everyone, go check out the new oils and testing kits to recommend to friends if you don't have those specific issues.  Also, think about what other testing kits you would like to see.

13:59:57
DaveC
It's mainly a sample of products that clients may want to use before the next cleansing and find helpful.

13:59:59
randyu
Great chat today. Thanks to all for this session!  Let's have another soon!

13:59:59
deedee
In the future and email me some ideas    at deedee@[ourdomain].com  or call me  608-242-0200.

14:00:00
jane.f
Thanks.

14:00:10
Victoria
All there is, is behavior, good and bad!

14:00:44
deedee
Thank you, everyone.  Glad to talk to you all.  Have a great  rest of your week!

14:00:50
randyu
Bye.
