Hey folks, sorry that I am late. I had some technical difficulties.

13:18:37
kristina
Please go ahead with what is on your mind.

13:19:16
kristina
First, the Optimal Health Network is having a 15% off all items sale.

13:19:49
philiph
Is your tanning bed working yet and how much does it cost?

13:20:50
kristina
This is a great time to stock up on those items you use for your enema series: super salve, an excellent enema nozzle lubricant that is also therapeutic to the anal area; our made-for-enema coffee, for taking your coffee enema.

13:21:29
kristina
Yes, our Vitamin D therapy bed is set up in our clinic.

13:21:52
kristina
The fees are stated on the link I just gave you. We also offer the first session for free.

13:23:03
kristina
and we are about to add two beds, one stand-up and the model that we have in the office, as items you can purchase for use in your own home. I absolutely love the beds and my vitamin D levels have been steadily rising since I started to use them, where they hadn't been rising well with the use of vitamin D supplementation.

13:23:25
kristina
Do you live locally, Philiph?

13:24:51
kristina
Wanna come over to the office one of these days and give the bed a try? What do you know about the importance of keeping your vitamin D levels high?

13:26:48
philiph
I was thinking about the winter.  Meanwhile, the link you gave me doesn't work.

13:33:35
kristina
Can you click on the link from this chat? It worked just fine for me.

13:34:01

Taking a vitamin D supplement is not the optimal way to regulate your body's vitamin D levels.

13:34:28
kristina
the best way to make sure you don't end up with too much or too little vitamin D is to produce it in your own body, by getting some exposure to beneficial ultraviolet A and B rays, like those produced by the sun.

13:34:39
philiph
I just checked the site under tanning and it seems like a reasonable price.

13:36:26
kristina
During the winter months, in most of the United States the sun won't stimulate vitamin D in your body, due to its increased distance. Your vitamin D levels can drop as much as 50% in the winter. Depleted of vitamin D, your immune system may not be up to its full potential, leaving you more susceptible to certain health concerns. In fact, I strongly believe that vitamin D deficiency is a growing epidemic!

13:36:37
kristina
Great! 

13:36:53
kristina
Vitamin D has demonstrated support for:     *       Your healthy immune system     *       Your cardiovascular system     *       Your prostate     *       Helping increase your level of white blood cells     *       Your healthy skin

13:37:08
kristina
Yes, there are vitamin D supplements on the market, but I feel that the best place for you to get your vitamin D is from ultraviolet B rays.

13:38:41
philiph
I think so too.

13:38:43
kristina
Have you had your vitamin D levels tested?

13:38:52
philiph
No.

13:42:54
kristina
This can be done with your medical doctor's lab or we offer vitamin D test kits for $75

13:44:26

Each cell in your body has its own DNA library that contains information needed to deal with virtually every kind of stimulus it may encounter, and the master key to enter this library is activated vitamin D.   For example, memory ductile cells in the breast need vitamin D to access DNA that enables the response to estrogen. So naturally, without sufficient amounts of vitamin D, your cells cannot access their DNA libraries and their functions are thereby impaired.   This is why vitamin D functions in so many different tissues, and affects such a large number of different diseases and health conditions. So far, scientists have found about 3,000 genes that are upregulated by vitamin D. Receptors that respond to the vitamin have been found in almost every type of human cell, from your brain to your bones. And researchers keep finding health benefits from vitamin D in virtually every area they look.

Optimizing your vitamin D levels can also help you to prevent as many as 16 different types of cancer including pancreatic, lung, breast, ovarian, prostate, and colon cancers. But perhaps most important to note is that vitamin D can lower your risk of dying from any cause, according to a new European meta-analysis published in the Archives of Internal Medicine in 2007.

Vitamin D Supplementation and Total Mortality

13:47:57
kristina
Background  Ecological and observational studies suggest that low vitamin D status could be associated with higher mortality from life-threatening conditions including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus that account for 60% to 70% of total mortality in high-income countries. We examined the risk of dying from any cause in subjects who participated in randomized trials testing the impact of vitamin D supplementation (ergocalciferol [vitamin D2] or cholecalciferol [vitamin D3]) on any health condition.

13:48:07
kristina
Conclusions:  Intake of ordinary doses of vitamin D supplements seems to be associated with decreases in total mortality rates. The relationship between baseline vitamin D status, dose of vitamin D supplements, and total mortality rates remains to be investigated. Population-based, placebo-controlled randomized trials with total mortality as the main end point should be organized for confirming these findings.

13:49:19
kristina
There are two vitamin D tests: 1,25(OH)D and 25(OH)D. 25(OH)D is the better marker of overall D status. It is this marker that is most strongly associated with overall health. 

13:49:27
kristina
The correct test is 25(OH)D, also called 25-hydroxyvitamin D.

13:49:38
kristina
Please note the difference between normal and optimal. You don't want to be average here; you want to be optimally healthy.

Ideally, the best place to get vitamin D is from your skin being exposed to the UV-B that is in normal sunlight. Vitamin D from sunlight acts as a pro-hormone, rapidly converting into 25-hydroxyvitamin D, or vitamin D3. 

13:51:59
kristina
Philiph, thanks for hanging out here with me while I share all of this information about vitamin D. I think I will close the chat now, unless you have any other comments.

13:53:31
kristina
Hey, Ronald. Welcome.

13:54:07
kristina
Also, I want to announce our new blog, which can be found at http://blog.optimalhealthnetwork.com/

Hi Kristina: Not been in  lately for a colon cleasing, I miss not having

We miss you, too.

13:55:25
Ronald
Any new procedures?

13:56:28
kristina
We are now offering two styles of vitamin D therapy beds for in-home use. If you read though the chat archive, you will get a picture of how important vitamin D is.

13:56:40
Ronald
I enjoy the colon fill with nurtritans and a plug.

13:56:54
kristina
Otherwise, we continue to add whole food supplements from Standard Process and herbs from MediHerbs to our supplement offerings.

kristina
Also, DeeDee and I are continuing our studies through an Australian College to become certified herbalists.

13:57:30
Ronald
do you have any 42&quot; colon tubes?

13:57:53
Ronald
DeeDee is great

13:58:45
kristina
Herbs turn out to be better choices than supplements in many cases to resolve hormonal imbalance and many of the gut issues: IBS, Crohn's Disease, Celiac Disease, constipation, gas and bloating, etc.

13:59:05
kristina
Yes, DeeDee is great. There is an article in this month's newsletter written by her.

Good bye for now. Thanks for joining me today. And, again, sorry to all of you who tried to come on the Live Chat at 12 and weren't able to get on. Due to technical difficulties, I didn't open the chat until 12:18.

14:02:57
Ronald
Next time I'm in area will look you up for the new implant.
