Hi folks!

12:55:35&nbsp;
kristina
Welcome to today's live chat. 

12:55:41&nbsp;
kristina
Today, of course, is Earth Day.

12:55:46&nbsp;
kristina
Happy Earth Day.

12:56:36&nbsp;
kristina
I would enjoy hearing from each of you as to how you think of Earth Day and how that connects to taking care of your own body.

12:57:10&nbsp;
kristina
I will also advance the topic of gluten today.

12:57:40&nbsp;
kristina
Of course, as always, I want to hear about what is on your mind so please do start your own topic and/or your own questions.

13:01:13&nbsp;
kristina
Hi Mike. So far, it is just you and I. Any thoughts?

13:01:38&nbsp;
Mike R.
Hi Kristina. This is my first time attending a chat.  I want to convince a couple of friends to try the water cleanse that you offer in your office, and am hoping to get tips on persuading them.

13:02:21&nbsp;
kristina
Hello Kristin

13:02:40&nbsp;
kristina
Okay, what do you like about colon cleansing in our office and why do you want your friends to try it?

13:02:58&nbsp;
kristin j
Hello!

13:03:38&nbsp;
Mike R.
Well I haven't tried it.  I saw it online and want to try it. I want them to try it also. I think it would be good for us all.

13:04:27&nbsp;
kristina
What do you think would be good. Where do you live?

13:05:49&nbsp;
kristina
In celebration of Earth Day, the OHN has added stainless steel water bottles. Please do not drink your water out of plastic water bottles.  Do not buy plastic water bottles. I write about this in my April newsletter which is due out today.

kristina
We have many people who visit us for multiple day treatments. 

13:09:36&nbsp;
kristina
We also offer massage and FIR sauna treatment.

13:09:39&nbsp;
kristina
Hi Lisa

13:09:44&nbsp;
kristina
Glad to see you here.

13:09:55&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Thank you!

13:10:12&nbsp;
kristina
Please do let me know how you celebrate Earth Day.

13:10:32&nbsp;
kristina
Back to the gluten topic -

13:10:45&nbsp;
kristin j
Okay.  Expect a call - I have many friends in Wisconsin, and you no doubt can tell me how many days I would need for the help you can offer.  Thank you!

13:11:01&nbsp;
kristina
Approximately 1 in 133 Americans suffer from  gluten sensitivity.

13:11:22&nbsp;
michael b
hi hellow fellow chatters - a most splendid spring to everyone.

13:11:41&nbsp;
kristina
Thanks, Michael.

13:11:56&nbsp;
kristina
We would be honored to have a visit from you, Kristin.

13:12:11&nbsp;
kristin j
Thank you!  I am so excited!

13:12:22&nbsp;
kristina
Far more of us are estimated to have some degree of gluten sensitivity.

13:12:26&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Animals suffer from gluten [sensitivity] too! Much pet food has gluten in it.

13:12:47&nbsp;
kristina
What health troubles are you struggling with, Kristin, and/or what are your goals for coming to the Optimal Health Center?

13:13:01&nbsp;
kristina
Lisa might chime in about her visits to the OHC.

13:13:15&nbsp;
Lisa P.
But I know we are talking about humans here. lol

13:14:11&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, animals also suffer from eating gluten-rich foods. We are starting to test pets with our hair analysis and find that many pets do not tolerate the amounts of carbohydrates they are eating. It is amazing how the pets respond to a lower grain diet.

13:14:17&nbsp;
kristin j
Dear Kristina - I have this horrible heaviness in my legs - as though I am being pulled into the earth!  And &quot;chiropractic&quot; issues, I guess, like sometimes I can barely walk for the misalignment in my body.  

13:15:33&nbsp;
kristina
Gluten is a protein in cereal grains. It is high in wheat, barley and rye and triggers inflammation and autoimmune diseases.

13:15:48&nbsp;
kristina
Technically, some form of gluten is found in all grains, so it's not really correct to refer to other grains as &quot;gluten-free,&quot; but that's what gluten-free customarily means: free of wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives.

13:15:57&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Visiting OHC was wonderful. Having the package of the massage, sauna and the colonic is unforgettable! I hope anyone that visits OHN will do this package deal! You still have that deal, don't you Kristina?

13:15:58&nbsp;
kristin j
My poor cat!  I have unknowingly given her an &quot;eating disorder&quot; by feeding her &quot;cat junk food&quot;  which now she craves. But I give her organic food now, with the junk food on top so she'll eat the good stuff. 

13:16:17&nbsp;
kristina
The best grains for most of us to eat are rice, amaranth, millet, quinoa, sorghum, and teff. 

13:16:29&nbsp;
kristina
Well done, Kristin

13:16:46&nbsp;
michael b
i see so many things listed as gluten free. i guess i have no knowledge till now.

13:17:09&nbsp;
kristina
Kristin, how do your arms feel?

13:17:27&nbsp;
kristin j
My arms feel normal

13:17:32&nbsp;
kristina
Spelt is not gluten-free. It is a species of wheat 

13:17:43&nbsp;
kristina
Despite its name, buckwheat is not wheat. It�s gluten-free, and it�s safe 

13:18:01&nbsp;
kristin j
I love buckwheat!!!!!!!!

13:18:11&nbsp;
kristina
Also, I recommend staying away from oats if you have any gluten sensitivity.

13:18:23&nbsp;
kristina
How do you use buckwheat, Kristin?

13:18:45&nbsp;
kristin j
I have only had it in pancakes; open for more ideas!

13:19:26&nbsp;
kristina
kristin, how is your circulation?

13:20:02&nbsp;
kristin j
My circulation seems same as always, though I have for a long time had cold feet and hands.

13:21:10&nbsp;
kristina
Gluten sensitivity is the main cause of Celiac disease and can also contribute or cause ADHD, thyroid issues, lupus, Type I Diabetes, arthritis, anemia, migraines, bone density disorders, skin problems and IBS.

13:21:17&nbsp;
kristin j
I had a &quot;health crisis&quot;  when I quit cold turkey oxycodone.  I was sick for months and many problems surfaced from 59 years of not being careful.

13:22:08&nbsp;
kristin j
Thank you, Lisa, for your report on your visit to Kristina's Center.  

13:22:26&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Kristin, have you seen a doctor recently about the heaviness in your legs?

13:23:18&nbsp;
kristin j
Because I have not found satisfaction with ordinary doctors, I have not gone to one concerning this; my naturopath says it is metal toxins which gather at the feet.

13:23:21&nbsp;
kristina
I would like to see a CBC panel from your medical doctor. I would like to see your iron levels. I would also like you to have a Vitamin D test.

13:23:31&nbsp;
kristina
Why were you on oxycodone?

13:24:19&nbsp;
kristin j
I had back pain from a broken back in 1998; and a rear end collision in 2002.  

13:24:41&nbsp;
kristina
Ouch. Sorry about that.

13:24:43&nbsp;
Lisa P.
I have to log out now. There is a phone call I have to take. I may be able to come back here. Ciao!

13:24:44&nbsp;
kristina
That is tough.

13:24:48&nbsp;
kristina
bye Lisa

13:25:04&nbsp;
michael b
thanks for the lowdown on gluten - nasty stuff.

13:25:28&nbsp;
kristin j
Thank you. 

13:25:55&nbsp;
Mike R.
i'm going to pass on to a friend that it may be related to her ongoing migraines

13:25:57&nbsp;
kristina
Mike, I do have two videos on You Tube that you might watch and have your friends watch.

13:26:15&nbsp;
Mike R.
i saw them yesterday :)  I will ask them to watch

13:26:28&nbsp;
Mike R.
considering buying your coffee

13:26:55&nbsp;
kristina
Of course, there is also a tremendous amount of written material on www.optimalhealthnetwork.com and on www.enemabag.com that speaks to why have a colon cleanse, what a colon cleanse is, what happens during a colon cleanse, how often  one needs to have a colon cleanse, and more.

13:27:15&nbsp;
Mike R.
ok thanks

13:27:21&nbsp;
kristin j
Mike has concerns shared by many of us.  I have friends with degenerative illnesses that I know could be helped by natural methods.  Our country used to train its doctors in the natural way.

13:28:20&nbsp;
kristina
Well, gluten can be a nourishing protein for many and has been for many of us for many years but for one reason or another, it is often becoming a real problem and needs to be avoided. I have a terrible gluten sensitivity and have had to learn to avoid EVERY single form of gluten from aspirin to commercial chicken.

13:28:35&nbsp;
kristina
Some health food supplements even have gluten in them unfortunately.

13:29:06&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, we are all designed to be healthy, vibrant, pain-free. If we aren't, we can usually do something about it.

13:29:16&nbsp;
kristin j
Amen!

13:29:55&nbsp;
kristin j
Is gluten labeled as anything else?

13:30:43&nbsp;
kristina
Our enema coffee is fabulous for use during a coffee enema. High in the therapeutic ingredients needed for a liver and gallbladder cleanse. It is also a fine drinking coffee as it is rich in taste, fair trade, organic, shade grown

13:31:23&nbsp;
kristina
starch

13:31:44&nbsp;
kristin j
Oh, it is in LOTS of things, then!

13:32:03&nbsp;
Mike R.
can you touch a bit on soy, kristina?  I was planning on replacing a my chicken intake with soy (tofu), then I read that soy intake has to be watched as too much can be toxic.

13:32:34&nbsp;
kristina
peptide bonded glutamine in supplement is apparently derived from hydrolyzed wheat gluten.

13:33:11&nbsp;
kristin j
When you get into those big notunderstandable words, I don't want to eat it!

13:33:20&nbsp;
Mike R.
lol

13:33:38&nbsp;
kristina
be cautious about is gluten-free labeling. 

13:33:50&nbsp;
kristin j
Oh no!

13:33:53&nbsp;
michael b
did you know how to tell the chicken you are eating is frozen? blood vessels are black. fresh chicken are pink.

13:33:55&nbsp;
kristina
Some companies label &quot;gluten-free&quot; even though there are trace amounts. In order to be sure that you are not ingesting trace amounts of gluten, it is best to contact the company and explain your situation. Ask if there is any chance that their products have cross-contamination.

13:34:06&nbsp;
kristina
Play-doh contains gluten. Personal care products such as chapstick, lipstick, and even some toothpastes may contain gluten. It is common for some hair care products to contain wheat protein.

13:34:33&nbsp;
Mike R.
good to know michael thx

13:34:37&nbsp;
kristin j
Oh, please!  Living has to be proactive!!!!!!

13:34:55&nbsp;
brian z
what is the purpose of soap in the enema other than to help break up the castor oil?

13:35:17&nbsp;
kristin j
I have recently learned that products not ingested are also absorbed in the body.  I have never given that much thought before.

13:35:43&nbsp;
kristina
I do write about soy in my book, Ten Days to Optimal Health, for further reading:
       http://www.optimalhealthnetwork.com/Nutritional-Therapy-and-Colon-Cleanse-Book-s/228.htm, which also includes a gluten free diet

13:36:04&nbsp;
michael b
i'm not going to eat anymore Play-doh.

13:36:09&nbsp;
kristina
Here are gluten-free dietary recommendations:
       http://www.optimalhealthnetwork.com/10-Day-Detoxification-and-Cleansing-Diet-s/186.htm

13:36:23&nbsp;
kristina
good for you, Michael.

13:36:43&nbsp;
kristina
I can't stand to be around Play-doh, which actually makes me very sad because it is fun.

13:37:12&nbsp;
kristin j
So when we contact things with gluten, we are affected?

13:37:31&nbsp;
kristina
Many people who prefer to eat plant protein eat a lot of soy and they don�t realize it is deficient in the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine. In the United States, soy foods are highly processed, which denatures the protein and increases levels of carcinogens. In addition, soy contains lots of phytoestrogens that have negative hormonal effects, as well as trypsin inhibitors that inhibit protein digestion and affect pancreatic function. Soy foods can also cause deficiencies in calcium and vitamin D. People with thyroid problems need to avoid soy altogether. Finally, it is now thought that soy foods consumed in large amounts may contribute to cancer.

13:37:51&nbsp;
kristina
If we are gluten-sensitive.

13:38:12&nbsp;
Mike R.
sounds like gluten is about like corn... in everything

13:38:23&nbsp;
kristina
Those who eat soy often point to its consumption in Asia. Although it is true that soy is part of the Asian diet, traditionally it was eaten in its fermented state, processed to remove the toxins, and eaten with meat. In Japan it is eaten with fish, and in China, with pork. It is not considered a replacement for animal foods and never constitutes more than 1 to 2% of total caloric intake. In Japan, the average consumption of soy is 10 grams�about two teaspoons�per day. The same is true of China. In short, although Asians include soy in their diet, they consider it a condiment and eat it in small amounts�never as a staple.

13:38:30&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, indeed.

13:38:58&nbsp;
Mike R.
yeah... sorry to hear that about soy

13:39:11&nbsp;
Mike R.
ty Kristina that's very good info to know

13:39:28&nbsp;
kristin j
I heard very few soy products are fermented in the way you say.

13:39:36&nbsp;
kristina
Gluten is also in the adhesive found on pastage stamps and envelopes, so don't lick those things!

13:40:04&nbsp;
kristin j
I mean that are available to us.  (soy products fermented)

13:40:21&nbsp;
kristina
Yes.

13:41:02&nbsp;
kristin j
Nuts!  Maybe we could learn to ferment things ourselves, as in the old days.

13:41:21&nbsp;
michael b
could that be why so many stamps are now self-sticking?

13:41:41&nbsp;
kristina
Tempeh, tamari, natto, miso are all examples of fermented soy products. But remember don't eat these foods as your primary protein sources.

13:41:43&nbsp;
kristin j
I heard that they tried the self-stick and people wouldn't accept the other.

13:42:08&nbsp;
kristina
have i missed any questions or comments?

13:42:19&nbsp;
Mike R.
Well you see these tofu recepies with these huge chunks of tofu, way more than 2 teaspoon full.  So unless the tofu's fermented soy they could be bad for you. hmm

13:42:35&nbsp;
Mike R.
nope... Thanks!

13:43:06&nbsp;
brian z
Hi, what is the purpose of soap in the enema other than to help break up the castor oil?

13:43:47&nbsp;
kristina
If you are avoiding gluten, you also need to avoid natural flavorings, caramel color, soy sauce, binders, flavor or spice extracts, unidentified starches, brewer's yeast, monosodium glutamate, maltodextrin and other preservatives.

13:43:49&nbsp;
kristina
Sorry.

13:44:02&nbsp;
kristina
To stimulate the colon to fully empty.

13:44:09&nbsp;
kristin j
what about brewer's yeast for my cat?

13:44:36&nbsp;
michael b
who would want to lick the back of edgar allan poe? nevermore.

13:44:49&nbsp;
kristin j
what about yeast from the health food store which we put on popcorn?

13:45:12&nbsp;
TaraM
Hello

13:45:30&nbsp;
kristina
Our therapeutic enema soaps also have essential oils that provide additional benefits to the colon, the prostate and to gut immunity.

13:45:40&nbsp;
kristina
That is brewer's yeast. I used to love that.

13:45:52&nbsp;
kristin j
Is it okay?

13:45:52&nbsp;
kristina
Is your cat gluten-sensitive?

13:45:56&nbsp;
kristina
no.

13:46:02&nbsp;
kristina
not if you are gluten-sensitive

13:46:10&nbsp;
kristina
What you can eat.

13:46:36&nbsp;
kristin j
How do i know if my cat is gluten-sensitive - or if I am?  Hey, you know my questions - thank you.

13:46:52&nbsp;
kristina
Healthy meats from grass-fed animals, nuts, seeds, fruits, vegetables, millet, beans, rice, eggs, and much more....

13:46:56&nbsp;
kristina
Raw dairy

13:47:08&nbsp;
michael b
is soy sauce fermented, so ok to use in moderation?

13:47:50&nbsp;
kristina
You can be tested by using the Adrenal Stress Index:
       http://www.optimalhealthnetwork.com/Saliva-Hair-Stool-Metabolic-Type-Tests-Madison-WI-p/OHC_TESTS.htm

13:47:56&nbsp;
kristina
yes

13:47:59&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Hi! I'm back for the last few minutes!

13:48:01&nbsp;
TaraM
Hi Kristina, I am new to this chat room, so I don't really know all of the rules here

13:48:14&nbsp;
kristina
yes

13:48:16&nbsp;
TaraM
but my question is somewhat different than the current discussion

13:48:40&nbsp;
TaraM
well actually, maybe not so different, it is an adrenal question

13:48:42&nbsp;
kristina
Welcome. We have 12 more minutes. Ask away. We are open to new threads of discussion related to health 

13:48:46&nbsp;
kristina
Great.

13:48:59&nbsp;
TaraM
OK, my question is about a testimonial I saw on your page

13:49:03&nbsp;
TaraM
Questions regarding this testimony:  I took a hair analysis and it was clear that I suffered from adrenal fatigue and hypothyroidism. I was greatly relieved for here was a finally diagnosis that explained both why I felt perpetually tired and dizzy and why

13:49:22&nbsp;
TaraM
I saw that on your testimonial page

13:49:29&nbsp;
TaraM
so here is my question

13:49:48&nbsp;
TaraM
my hair is thinning around the edges in the front, I am 38 years old

13:50:03&nbsp;
kristina
Here is some scientific research about a gluten free diet:

13:50:04&nbsp;
kristina
Effect of a gluten-free diet on gastrointestinal symptoms in celiac disease. Joseph A Murray, Tureka Watson, Beverlee Clearman and Frank Mitros. American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, Vol. 79, No. 4, 669-673, April 2004. With a gluten-free diet, patients have substantial and rapid improvement of symptoms, including symptoms other than the typical ones of diarrhea, steatorrhea, and weight loss.

13:50:22&nbsp;
TaraM
I have always had a full head of hair though, so I am wondering if that hair strand test would detect if I have adrenal problems

13:51:18&nbsp;
kristina
thining hair is a hormonal imbalance.

13:51:22&nbsp;
kristina
we can address that.

13:51:49&nbsp;
kristina
It is likely you have adrenal issues as well as thyroid issues and possibly an excess of estrogen in the body.

13:52:17&nbsp;
TaraM
well I had a hysterectomy

13:52:32&nbsp;
TaraM
back in 2007

13:53:09&nbsp;
kristina
Oh yeah, then there is beer, wich is made from the gluten grains.

13:53:11&nbsp;
TaraM
I had fibroids that made my uterus 11 pounds

13:53:40&nbsp;
kristina
I would be honored to have the chance to work with you.

13:54:09&nbsp;
TaraM
the fibroids were too close to my cervix and had me bleeding.  Sorry to the other people on here, I hope I don't make anyone feel uncomfortable and that I am not too graphic

13:54:20&nbsp;
kristina
This is why we are here Tara.

13:54:21&nbsp;
kristin j
No problem

13:54:25&nbsp;
kristina
Please continue.

13:54:27&nbsp;
TaraM
but that is the reason for the hysterectomy

13:54:28&nbsp;
kristina
You are brave.

13:54:31&nbsp;
TaraM
thanks

13:54:32&nbsp;
kristina
Yikes. 

13:54:57&nbsp;
kristina
Sounds like you have been struggling with hormonal imbalance for years.

13:55:02&nbsp;
TaraM
yeah it was awful, so now I guess I need to do a hormone test

13:55:07&nbsp;
kristina
I wish that you could have had the hand you needed many years ago.

13:55:10&nbsp;
kristina
Yes.

13:55:23&nbsp;
Mike R.
Is it typical for mucoid plaque to be expelled with a hydrotherapy session?  Say a 1st time visitor?

13:55:30&nbsp;
TaraM
yes, most of the women in my family have fibroid issues

13:56:08&nbsp;
TaraM
my blood count was down to a 6.1 when I think it should have been between 12 and 16

13:56:29&nbsp;
kristina
We also do a female hormone panel but let's start with laying the foundation with the hair analysis and the Adrenal Stress Index.

13:56:40&nbsp;
TaraM
so they were trying to give me a blood transfusion but I refused it, and just ate up iron pills until I stabilized

13:56:48&nbsp;
TaraM
ok

13:56:55&nbsp;
kristina
No, it isn't common for mucoid plaque to be expelled with the first colon hydrotherapy session.

13:56:57&nbsp;
TaraM
so I can get that from your website then

13:57:02&nbsp;
kristin j
Lisa,  do you think I should go the the regular doctor about my legs?

13:57:11&nbsp;
kristina
I only see the mucoid plaque when a person is fasting and using colon cleanse products.

13:57:29&nbsp;
michael b
this has been more chats than usual - will this continue?

13:57:29&nbsp;
Mike R.
i want mine out  lol

13:57:33&nbsp;
kristina
http://www.optimalhealthnetwork.com/Vit-Ra-Tox-Chlorella-Cleansing-Clay-Liver-Forte-p/0HDetoxAids.htm

13:57:50&nbsp;
kristin j
I am doing dr. natura colonics, but not fasting.

13:57:56&nbsp;
kristina
I lay out in my book how to remove 15-60 feet of the mucoid plaque during a 5-day fast.

13:58:10&nbsp;
kristin j
WOW

13:58:19&nbsp;
kristina
what do you mean, Michael? Today or next month?
