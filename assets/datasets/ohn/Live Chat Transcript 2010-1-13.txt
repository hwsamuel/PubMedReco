hi lisa!

20:01:14
Lisa
Hi! Am I the first one here?

20:01:34
Lisa
I want to hear about your exciting trip!!!

20:02:15
Lisa
In the fall, I'm thinking of going to Spain!

20:02:43
kristina
That sounds great!

20:02:59
Lisa
I loved the picture of you on the horse!

20:03:09
kristina
Rayna almost got bitten by a deadly snake!

20:03:19
kristina
Thank you.

20:03:39
kristina
How will you decide about the trip to Spain?

20:03:52
Lisa
Oh no! First she fell from a tree on a trip and another near disaster!

20:03:54
kristina
Yes, you are the only one here. 

20:04:22
Lisa
Spain all depends if I can afford it.

20:04:49
kristina
Well,  I wish you well on that endeavor!

20:05:05
kristina
Hi Scott!

20:05:34
Lisa
The good news about Spain that it's one of the cheapest countries in Europe.

20:05:47

Hello, Kris.  Greetings from the land of rare winter weather.  And I left Chicago for this warmth?

20:06:12
kristina
A blessing to all of those who have been affected by the earthquake in Haiti.

20:06:23
Lisa
You had a good break from the snow!

20:06:33
kristina
My webmaster just flew to the Dominican Republic on Tuesday!

20:06:42
Lisa
Wow!

20:06:43
kristina
Where are you, Scott?

20:07:04
Lisa
Hi Scott! Hope you are doing well.

20:07:27
Scott W
Near Nashville, TN.  Around here winter is normally four days in February.  Not this year!

20:07:33
kristina
One of my favorite parts of my trip to Guatemala was all the chances that I had to speak in Spanish.

20:07:39
kristina
Cold?

20:08:03
Lisa
I love Nashville!!

20:08:13
kristina
I have decided to become fluent in Spanish. 

20:08:30
Lisa
That's great Kris!

20:08:31
kristina
Do either of you have anything on your mind?

20:08:33
Scott W
Six days in the low teens and all the nights that or less.  Around 20-25 degrees below normal for this time of year.

20:08:42
kristina
yikes!

20:08:57
kristina
Guatemala, I thought, was quite cold, and rainy!

20:09:07
Scott W
At least my townhouse in Chicago was insulated

20:09:53
Lisa
Well, I guess thay have their winters too!

20:10:17
Lisa
I hope Don will join us!

20:10:24
kristina
The trip to Guatemala was a huge success as far as what I learned about coffee growing, fair trade, growing my relationships with the farmers at Finca Santa Anita, all the photographs and video I took, and  learning more about the history of the enema.

20:10:27
Lisa
I mean Dave.

20:10:36
kristina
Hello, Joseph!

20:10:51
Scott W
Before I retired, my company always found a way for me to be near the equator in July and August and in northern Canada in January.  I was really trying to find out what I'd done wrong to deserve that!

20:10:56
JosephP
good evening kris :)

20:11:12
kristina
Wrong?

20:11:25
kristina
oh...now I see...

20:11:33
kristina
yes, too hot and too cold!

20:12:26
Lisa
Sounds like Rayna had fun on her birthday last month!

20:12:50
Scott W
Learning Spanish?  I've been around Spanish speaker for most of my life, but found these folks had trouble commuicating with each other because of dialect.  Which flavor have you learned?

20:13:22
kristina
Mexican, I guess.

20:13:26
Lisa
Going to Argentina is a dream of mine.

20:14:38
kristina
Joseph, anything on your mind tonight?

20:15:17
JosephP
just here to watch and learn tonight

20:15:21
Scott W
I missed how you go to Guatemala.  I understand their forest is a treasure trove of medicinals.

20:15:47
Lisa
I hope more people join in tonight!

20:16:39
JosephP
small group so far

20:16:58
kristina
There are two skins to coffee: the fruit is the outside covering the coffee bean; the coffee bean has a layer of mucous covering it. 

20:17:09
Lisa
I enjoy your Facebook page. It is nicer than the old chatroom. 

20:17:20
kristina
Once the fruit is taken off, the coffee bean is then fermented to remove the mucous layer.

20:17:34
kristina
Thanks, Lisa. 

20:17:52
kristina
Yes, I like the new Facebook page, too. If you aren't a friend yet, please do join.

20:18:27
Lisa
You sure now know your coffee. Very interesting!

20:18:41
JosephP
I will

20:19:04
kristina
How long the coffee is fermented depends on the altitude in the mountains: the higher the altitude, the more time the bean needs to lose its mucous layer.

20:19:23
Lisa
All the pictures from your trip are breathtaking! 

20:19:51
kristina
Yes, within the next 3 months, I will have developed a lot of new content on www.enemabag.com about coffee production, fair trade coffee, the history of enemas, and more.

20:20:10
Lisa
Cool!

20:20:13
kristina
I wish I could get it all on the internet already. I didn't realize how long it would take.

20:20:29
JosephP
I must say, I do enjoy your coffee for enemas.

20:20:31
kristina
I am also working on a new website called www.safeguatemalatravel.com [not yet launched].

20:21:02
kristina
Our trip was filled with kind, kind people who were always looking out for us.

20:21:23
kristina
Mind saying more about that, Joseph?

20:21:24
Lisa
Wow, that's great Kris! I look forward to that! You know how much I LOVE to travel!

20:22:10
kristina
Yes, I am amazed at how much I learned and can share with you all from this trip to Guatemala. The first two articles will appear in the upcoming newsletter due out on January 23rd.

20:22:51
JosephP
well, I usually take a few goat soap bulb enemas, then a 2 quart celtic sea salt and peppermint oil rinse, and try to hold about 1 1/2 quarts of the coffee enema for retention

20:23:32
kristina
After the enzymes remove the sweet, mucous layer on the coffee bean, the coffee is laid out to dry in the sunshine on large cement patios, like an outdoor basketball court.

20:23:33
Lisa
I like the coffee enema because it gives my energy. I do make it a little stronger than before, but not too strong.

20:23:34
JosephP
I notice the coffee enema really cleans out the bile, and I make it so I don't get a buzz

20:23:56
Lisa
I love getting a buzz! Lol!

20:23:56
JosephP
not a big buzz 

20:24:12
kristina
Great. Can you tell a difference between our made-for-enema coffee and other coffees that you have tried or no?

20:24:39
Lisa
I've tried only yours.

20:25:00
JosephP
I only tried Folgers once beforehand... and yes, I got too big of a caffeine buzz - maybe the way I mixed it

20:25:48
JosephP
when I have time, I like to take that whole series

20:26:10
Lisa
Is it true coffee for enemas has more caffeine?

20:26:19
kristina
Get this:

20:26:32
kristina
you need 5.2 to 5.5 pounds of fresh picked coffee to have a pound of roasted coffee!

20:27:35
JosephP
is that because only a portion of the bean is used kris?

20:30:35
Lisa
I hate to say this, but I have a student coming at 7:30 so I have to go. I will keep an eye on facebook to read more about your trip. Have a good evening!

20:32:02
Scott W
Kris, what is the difference between a made-for-enema blend and the regular stuff I would buy?

20:33:11
kristina
Yes, the outside covering of the coffee bean, the red, juicy fruit, is removed and discarded.

20:33:37
kristina
And, the mucous layer has weight.

20:33:56
kristina
And, if a single bean doesn't pass a certain level of quality, it is tossed.

20:35:02
kristina
Certain farms are working on using the red, juicy fruit layer in compost systems with worms, for bio-diesel, as briquettes to burn for heat.

20:36:25
JosephP
oh that is good

20:37:34
kristina
our made-for-enema coffee blend is higher in palmitates and caffeine than most other coffee blends.

20:38:59
JosephP
so should I notice a bigger buzz after an enema with your coffee, kris?

20:40:28
kristina
no matter what coffee one uses for a coffee enema, you ought not feel a buzz from taking the coffee enema.

20:40:36
kristina
If you do, you are using too much coffee.

20:41:10
JosephP
gotcha

20:41:12
kristina
When I drink the coffee, however, I can tell that it has more caffeine.

20:41:23
JosephP
I will have to try that

20:42:31
Scott W
I've reduced my caffeine intake at the urging of my dr.  How much caffeine will I absorb from a coffee enema, and how long will it stay in my system?

20:42:33
kristina
I like the coffee for drinking very much; I use less and it tastes great.

20:42:51
kristina
hmmm...good questions...I am not sure that I know the answer.

20:43:41
kristina
However, there is much evidence that coffee enemas are therapeutic. 

20:44:07
kristina
How many caffeinated beverages had you been drinking?

20:44:14
JosephP
well, kris, I had my prostate removed last June 3... and just wondering if continuing on with the flexnozzle and delrin I have is doing any damage to my colon, since the prostate is in such close proximity with the anus...

20:44:47
kristina
Why is he suggesting you reduce your caffeine intake?

20:45:16
Scott W
Coffee is really the only thing.  I'm not into soda beverages, and coffee and water seem to take care of my needs.  I've reduced my caffeine intake because of high blood pressure.

20:45:37
kristina
Do you feel any irriation from the nozzles when you cleanse your colon?

20:46:30
JosephP
a bit with the flexitip

20:48:29
kristina
What about with the delrin nozzle?

20:48:50
JosephP
not as much

20:49:26
kristina
Maybe stick to the delrin nozzle when you take your enema series?

20:49:31
kristina
Hello, Herk.

20:50:57
JosephP
yeah, good idea - lol - was just wondering if my lining was still weak

20:51:13
herk
hello

20:51:55
kristina
I wouldn't think so. What do you think?

20:53:11
kristina
Next Live Chat is Wednesday, January 27th at 12, noon. Thanks for coming tonight. Do join me on Facebook as I am continually publishing photos and videos from the trip. Also, I have a new video on YouTube now about the history of the enema; it is short without explanation but intriguing. 

20:53:30
JosephP
well, I don't know for sure how long it would take to heal

20:53:36
kristina
Turns out the enema was used often throughout Mayan history.

20:53:44
JosephP
I guess about 6 months is enough 

20:54:08
JosephP
now that is interesting

20:54:21
kristina
Will vary in different individuals; be cautious about what nozzle you use; stay away from the colon tube.

20:55:04
JosephP
okay.. I will

20:55:06
JosephP
Thank you very much kris, have a great week, until next time!

20:55:14
kristina
yes, very interesting, lots of writing and documenting to do. I didn't expect that but here I am ready to burst with stories of what I learned about the history of the enema.

20:55:29
kristina
See you all soon!

20:55:54
Scott W
Stay warm and safe.  I'll see you during the noon visit later this month.
