A most happy Wednesday to you.

DeeDee, I take it you are running the chat today?

13:00:02
michael b
I guess I get to ask lots of questions. Ihave not had a chance to try the trace minerals yet.

13:02:01
ddelkamp
Hi Michael, I am back to my desk from running around the office.  How are you?

13:02:24
ddelkamp
Welcome Dave

13:02:38
Dave
Hi all

13:02:44
michael b
How is your weather in Madison?

13:03:24
ddelkamp
Our weather is a little warmer, in high 20s low 30s.  We had snow and ice the other night, so this is pretty good today.

13:03:51
ddelkamp
What questions do you have on the minerals, Michael?

13:04:09
ddelkamp
Welcome Raschal49

13:04:22

Thanks

What is the topic today?

13:05:35
Dave
Getting back to a subject of your last chat: Is the external use of essential oils sufficient to relieve abdominal issues, or first aid pending implant?

13:06:00
ddelkamp
I was just reading a study that they have done on oregano oil.  We know it has antimicrobial properties, so they were putting it onto meat before grilling so that the meat would not have to be cooked as long, saving some of the nutrients and enzymes.  

13:07:22
michael b
I have not had a chance to do anything with the minerals yet.

13:07:38
ddelkamp
What they discovered is that it was also inhibiting carcinogenic properties, so it can actually prevent cancer - is what they are thinking.

13:07:48
ddelkamp
Oregano oil is one of the essential oils we have been using here. Just thought that was interesting and potentially really great!!

13:08:50
ddelkamp
Many essential oils can work both topically and internally.  It depends on the oil and its properties as to how it will work best.  Also, everyone responds differently.  What oils are you wanting to work with?

13:09:57
Dave
Perhaps lavender and other soothing ones.

13:10:12
ddelkamp
Did you have questions about the minerals, Michael?

13:11:27
ddelkamp
Lavender can work really well topically and internally, as well as inhaled.  If you are trying to soothe the intestines, rubbing over your whole stomach area and doing an implant of the lavender should both work very well.

13:12:18
ddelkamp
Is anyone planning a New Year's cleanse?

13:12:59
Dave
An aid to regularity (anti-constipation) as well as soothing?

13:13:44
Dave
Have a colonic lined up first of year.

13:14:32
michael b
I would like for you to talk more about a New Year's cleanse.

13:14:51
ddelkamp
Lavender is more soothing, but not as useful for constipation.  Peppermint, ginger, fennel, tarragon, and a blend of these and more found in Di-Gize works very well.

13:16:03
ddelkamp
I will be doing the Core Restore program after the holidays, with of course colonics mixed in with some oils and coffee afterwards.

13:16:16
Dave
In fact my first colonic was a couple days into the new year 12 years ago.

13:17:04
ddelkamp
Dave, do you still do colonics every year around that time?  Or do you do them throughout the year also?

13:18:22
Dave
Monthly or a bit more frequently year-round, including OHN of course, lol.

13:19:46
Dave
Lot of therapists tell me they follow the same schedule.

13:20:42
ddelkamp
I will use lemongrass in my colonics.  I have been using lemongrass on my clients.  This is very good for killing all the bad bacteria and also restoring the good flora as well as working on constipation.

13:21:19
ddelkamp
Yes, I try do a cleanse monthly for maintenance, and if I am doing a fast, etc.,  I do it more frequently.

13:21:50
Dave
A few drops in the water or as implant?

13:22:50
ddelkamp
I use about 6-12 drops in the water as I am doing the cleansing part of the colonic (or enema) and then about 6 drops at the end with a little water and have the client hold for 10 minutes or so.

13:23:13
michael b
It has been 5 years since I found Kristina's website. My concern at that time was toxins that I had been exposed to.

13:25:05
ddelkamp
Do you feel that you removed most of your toxins at this point, Michael?

13:26:25
ddelkamp
So Michael, what is keeping you from trying your mineral implant?

13:27:53
Dave
Will have to try lemongrass next time. Have several binding drugs at work.

13:28:42
ddelkamp
I will tell you a little more about lemongrass.  Just jump in with any questions about that or anything.  Lemongrass is used for purification and digestion.  It is antifungal, antibacterial, antiparasitic, anti-inflammatory, regenerates connective tissue, and ligaments, dilates blood vessels, improves circulation, and promotes lymph flow.

13:29:41
ddelkamp
This would be a great oil to use when the flu hits.  Especially the stomach flu.  To rub on and to use in an enema!

13:31:32
Dave
Stomach flu and enemas seem contradictory on the surface, but some of us learned early they were not.

13:32:32
michael b
Hi again, DeeDee. I am much more aware of toxins now, and avoid them, but now know more about ridding my body of them, much thanks to OHN.

13:33:20
ddelkamp
That is very true.  Doing an enema during the flu helps the body to rid itself of the virus more quickly and makes the length of the illness much shorter and less severe.

13:35:28
ddelkamp
How are your immune systems holding up?  Are you on vitamin D?  Our vitamin D therapy bed is starting to get busier.  With this coldness and lack of sunshine, we all need it more and more here in Wisconsin.  Vitamin D has great immune power also.

13:36:18
Dave
That was the wisdom back in the day when an enema bag or can was a household necessity. Needs to be revived.

13:37:51
ddelkamp
That is very true.  Dave, did you receive enemas as a child?

13:37:51
michael b
The company, Young Living, is most amazing, all of oils they offer.

13:38:50
ddelkamp
I love Young Living.  It is hard to imagine the power that they have and that we have using them to heal ourselves.  It is all right there in nature, everything we need to heal.

13:40:14
Dave
Probably two or three a year, generally associated with illness combined with constipation. A need, not a scheduled thing. Others tell you similar?

13:41:57
ddelkamp
Yes, not to offend, but some of the older clients I have do tell me about those experiences and how even though they did not like getting them at the time, they did make them feel better.

13:42:14
ddelkamp
Others in the same age range never experienced them, so it is interesting on how some had them in their house and others didn't.

13:43:57
michael b
The latest I have read is that flu shots still have mercury, aluminium, and formaldehyde.

13:45:39
ddelkamp
You are probably right about the shots, though they will tell you that they are perfectly safe.  I never get them for myself or my family.

13:46:54
Dave
Very typical bittersweet memories. Most of my neighbor friends had homes with bags displayed in the bathroom. No secrets. But there are others that were non-enema, as you say.

13:48:23
ddelkamp
I wonder if the enema bag users were more of the natural healer types of households.

13:50:13
michael b
When I was in basic training in the army, I got all the shots that people going to Vietnam got. Talk about some strange reactions. 

13:50:45
ddelkamp
Do either of you have a specific question for me before we end?  My client has come in and is waiting for her session.

13:51:05
Dave
Maybe today rather than back them, when enemas were not &quot;alternative&quot; medicine but something most docs totally approved of. Even Spock in his early post WWII editions.

13:51:29
Dave
All for me. Thanks, DeeDee.

13:52:21
ddelkamp
Thank you, Dave and Michael, and have a wonderful holiday!!!

13:52:54
michael b
It was great to share time with both of you.

13:53:11
Dave
The same for you and yours. Taking a holiday break?

13:53:15
ddelkamp
Thank you!!  Stay well!

13:53:35
ddelkamp
I will take this Friday and next Monday off.

13:53:57
michael b
Also stay warm and healthy.

13:54:09
Dave
Hope Santa treats you well!

13:54:21
ddelkamp
Thank you and he'd better! :) 

13:55:10
michael b
Tell Kristina to stay healthy and happy.

13:56:37
michael b
Don't forget to wear your studded tennis shoes.

13:57:12
michael b
Bye bye now.
