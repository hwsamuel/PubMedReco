Hi.  I use pain pills for my back and they always have my gut somewhat upset. 

19:59:09
kristina
Hi Tri-Squire.

19:59:16
kristina
Thanks for joining me.

19:59:59
tri-squire
Hi, tri-squire is my sign on name. Just call me Jim.

20:00:06
kristina
Thanks, Jim.

20:00:21
kristina
That is hard that your gut is upset from the pain pills.

20:00:43
kristina
Have you tried changing pain meds?

20:00:50
kristina
Have you tried dietary changes?

20:01:07
kristina
Do you take any supplements to optimize your gut health?

20:02:01
tri-squire
Ok, my question is, after doing a full gut wash-out using a 4 qt. with castile + lavender, two times, what would be the best additive to put in a 3 to 4 qt. rinse to leave gut in gentle, non-irritated state? 

20:02:12
Dave
Hi

20:03:13
TomE
Hello from Massachusetts tonight, long distance

20:03:13
tri-squire
I have tried Mylanta, and I have tried Pepto-Bismol.

20:04:27
kristina
Start by using an aloe vera and bifidonate rinse.

20:04:47
Joseph
Hello Kris, everybody :)

20:05:10
Jan H
Hello, this is my first visit chatting live

20:05:30
tri-squire
Yea, I use several oral Rx, both prescription , and OTC  Tigan  is a  good Rx.

20:05:49
kristina
Hello to all.

20:06:03
kristina
What do you eat?

20:06:35
tri-squire
Vegetarian, lots of dark grain.

20:06:35
TomE
How are the new Stainless Steel enema buckets working?

20:07:02
kristina
Mix 1 tablespoon of bifidonate with 1 cup of aloe vera and 1 cup of water. Hold that mixture for as long as you are able to after you have cleared the colon out with two cleansing enemas.

20:07:15
kristina
Welcome, Jan!

20:07:24
Jan H
Thanks, Kristina

20:07:50
kristina
The new 4 quart complete colon cleanse enema buckets are absolutely fabulous; customers love them.

20:08:36
TomE
I have the small one I have used; thinking about the larger volume upgrade.

20:08:40
kristina
At any time, please feel free to ask questions about the colon cleanse, your own health, a family member's health, our enema equipment, our clinical services or whatever is on your mind.

20:08:55
kristina
How does my suggested implant sound to you, Jim?

20:09:42
Dave
Of course, at twice the size of the traditional enema can, you can do two fills I assume.

20:09:57
kristina
The stainless steel is a higher quality; of course, it holds an entire gallon of water; the spout is flush with the bottom so it drains all the enema liquid.

20:10:33
TomE
Thanks

20:11:15
Dave
The spouts on older ones always left an inch of water.

20:11:16
kristina
Yes, you can use one full can  to take two seperate enemas, but it is also common for a person taking an enema series to take at least 3 quarts of water. I also recommend the warmest water so a refill is often needed to keep the water temperature high enough with the second enema in the enema series.

20:11:38
kristina
Have you all joined me on Facebook yet?

20:11:46
TomE
Yes that's one thing I do not like; will setup an order for the new one.

20:12:02
TomE
I do use facebook alot

20:12:11
Joseph
yes i did kris

20:12:14
Jan H
Kristina, I have been in menopause for a few years, have a lot of upper bloating, have had all GI and GYN tests, all are very normal. Except CT scan showed a fatty liver. I do have very high cholesterol.  I take enemas, what would you suggest in the enema?

20:12:15
kristina
Yes, the new enema buckets allow all the enema solution to drain. And, there is that fabulous handle on the enema bucket.

20:12:34
tri-squire
Ok, I guess I will be ordering soon.

20:13:00
Jan H
Or supplement?  GI doctor said perhaps gluten allergy or IBS. I'm so confused.

20:13:01
kristina
Please post as often as you like on Facebook. I enjoy corresponding often. 

20:13:27
Jan H
The enemas give me so much relief from the bloating though.

20:13:42
kristina
What do you currently use in your enema solution? How do you feel after you take the enemas?

20:14:16
kristina
We offer a saliva test for gliadin sensitivity.

20:14:25
kristina
I have found it to be one of the most useful tools we offer. 

20:14:28
Jan H
I use your goat's milk soap and water with the first and filtered water in the second.  I feel amazing for hours.

20:14:55
kristina
If gluten is an issue, very small amounts of it can ruin your health in so many ways and certainly cause the symptoms you are speaking of.

20:15:20
kristina
Might you add a third enema in the series - a coffee enema?

20:15:41
kristina
The coffee enema will assist your liver and your gallbladder to function more optimally.

20:16:00
Jan H
How much coffee to a 2 quart bag would you suggest?

20:16:17
kristina
Do you also have inflammation in your liver?

20:16:43
Jan H
Not that I'm aware of, just said a fatty liver and high cholesterol (for years)

20:17:19
kristina
When first starting a coffee enema program, use a small amount of coffee and water - one quart of plain, filtered water to 1 tablespoon of brewed coffee. 

20:17:36
Dave
I'd add that the coffee enema works best when the colon's already cleansed rather than as a single.

20:17:49
kristina
For your next enema, use 2 tablespoons of brewed coffee in the coffee enema to one quart of water.

20:18:07
kristina
Each time you take a coffee enema, increase the coffee by one tablespoon but don't increase the water.

20:18:33
Jan H
How long should I try to retain each one?

20:18:38
tri-squire
Is facebook free?

20:18:49
kristina
If you can't hold all that enema solution for at least 12 minutes, consider taking a third cleansing enema before the coffee enema and/or reduce the amount of water in the enema back but not the coffee.

20:19:17
kristina
yes, Facebook is free. It is similar to a live chat but with many more ways to interact.

20:19:48
Jan H
I understand Kristina. I will order your organic coffee and start that next week.

20:20:16
tri-squire
Thanks.  Logging off now.  Got to go get some exercise.

20:20:22
kristina
Higher cholesterol is not necessarily a negative thing in the human body. Read my book, Ten Days to Optimal Health, to learn more. Also, go on the website, www.westonaprice.org and read about the importance of cholesterol in human health.

20:20:35
kristina
12-15 minutes you try to retain the coffee enema.

20:20:49
kristina
Great!

20:20:51
Jan H
Thanks very much, I'll do that as well.  And retain 12-15 mins.

20:21:11
kristina
Did I miss any questions or comments?

20:21:39
VinceB
Prep for colonoscopy...what do you recommend?

20:21:44
Dave
Discussing spring cleanse tonight?

20:21:45
TomE
my doctor wants me to do another colonoscopy; not sure its worth the trouble

20:22:01
kristina
Prep for colonoscopy....

20:22:39
kristina
Use a series of enemas, three times in a row over a 24 hour period, right before you go for the procedure.

20:22:47
TomE
The prep is no joy - considered discussing using an enema series with the doctor instead of his.

20:23:12
kristina
I have worked with many, many clients to prep their colon for a colonoscopy.

20:23:46
kristina
99% of the time, just using enemas, the prep is successful, which I bet is better than with the golytely!

20:23:46
TomE
I will discuss it - it would be much better for me.

20:24:04
VinceB
Which series?  Something similar to the coffee enema series?

20:24:31
kristina
Yes, I have known so many people who spend a month recovering from the prep of a colonoscopy because the chemical laxatives can be very hard on a sensitive digestive tract.

20:25:13
kristina
For the first enema in the series use a quality soap, like our made-for-enemas goat milk soaps.

20:25:34
kristina
For the second enema in the series use a clean water and peppermint oil.

20:27:33
kristina
For the third enema in the series use water and coffee.

20:27:33
kristina
Do these enema series three times over the 24, or so, hours before the procedure.

20:27:33
kristina
Anyone here now done this already?

20:27:33
kristina
Anyone here done this already?

20:27:33
VinceB
Already have your goat milk soap and peppermint oil

20:27:33
VinceB
Is there a third enema?

20:27:33
Dave
Is 2 qts typical? That's my max comfort level.

20:27:33
TomE
I am correct that you mean  3, 3 bag enemas  each.  How long before going in for procedure for last round? How long beteween the 3 sets?

20:27:33
TomE
I have  your goat milk soap and peppermint.

20:28:30
Dave
Is 2 qts typical? That's about the top of my comfprt level in enemas, but take more with colonics.

20:28:31
kristina
Yes, two quarts of water taken into the colon during an enema is probably the most common quantity of enema solution.

20:28:53
kristina
As close to the procedure as possible for the last enema series.

20:29:31
VinceB
Should you end with a coffee enema?

20:29:34
TomE
I generally can handle 2.5-3 quarts. Thanks for the info. I can tell you it will be easier on the system.

20:29:37
kristina
One needs to take at least two to three enemas to clear out the entire colon in an enema series. This is why you take multiple enemas at one time, over a 30-60 minute period.

20:29:51
kristina
In this way, you are using enemas like a colon hydrotherapy session.

20:30:04
TomE
Would you suggest I use my colon tube?

20:30:17
kristina
Yes, ending with the coffee enema.

20:30:35
VinceB
Thanks Kristina.

20:30:37
Jan H
How does the peppermint oil help?

20:30:42
TomE
Thanks.

20:31:03
kristina
Colon tubes are a fine nozzle choice because one is able to directly deliver the water deeper into the colon.

20:31:38
kristina
I don't have the product on the site yet, but we now offer a 5 foot silicone colon tube, 32FR.

20:32:02
kristina
Only one of its kind on the market; I am very pleased to be able to introduce this silicone colon tube here.

20:32:22
VinceB
Is 5 feet too long?

20:33:52
TomE
Is that the same size as your shorter model that I got from you?

20:35:53
Tom P
Hi, Kristina

20:36:00
VinceB
Got disconected.  I will have to end.  Will read the entire script when it is archived. Thanks again Kristina for your expert advice.

20:36:29
TomE
are you resetting the chat?

20:36:29
kristina
The peppermint oil is both soothing to the colon, allowing it to receive the water without the cramping and stimulating once peristalsis begins. 

20:36:41
Jan H
Kristina, is peppermint oil something that I should be using on a regular basis like the goat's milk soap enemas? Also, how much peppermint oil to a 2 quart bag of water?

20:37:02
kristina
I don't know what is going on with the chat connection.

20:37:16
kristina
You are very welcome, Vince.

20:37:16
Tom P
I just joined, late :)

20:37:21
kristina
I hope to talk to you again soon.

20:37:28
kristina
Welcome, Tom.

20:37:30
Jackie P
Me too, sorry about that, I kinda forgot.

20:37:49
kristina
Welcome, Jackie

20:38:01
Jackie P
I have a question, Kristina.  With regards to scheduling, would it be preferable to do enemas before or after exercise?

20:38:09
TomE
is the new 5-ft colon tube the same as the 30-in I bought from you?

20:39:11
TomE
I bought the delrin tip tube but find it a bit too much and use the standard one fine

20:39:38
kristina
I think try both and see what your body prefers. I see advantages to both taking an enema series before exercise and taking an enema series after exercise.

20:39:39
Dave
Back to coffee enemas: is 6 inches or so of insertion best, rather than deeper?

20:40:57
kristina
yes

20:41:29
Dave
Thanks, that was my impression.

20:42:01
kristina
Most experts do say to deliver the coffee enema solution past the rectal area but not beyond the sigmoid colon.

20:42:39
kristina
yes, to the new colon tube is the same FR diameter as the 30-inch colon tube, just longer.

20:43:12
emmettb
Kris, I work in home health. About 3 weeks ago picked up scabies in a home i was in. I've been using an online brand to stop this. It's not working. Any advice?

20:43:58
kristina
I don't recommend delivering the entire five feet of colon tube into the colon, but having a longer colon tube can make it easier to insert the colon tube deeper into the colon.

20:44:50
TomE
I can use the 30-in but think only a few more inches would be the limit.  The longer length would be nicer though.

20:46:02
Tom P
Kristina... have you encountered the idea that frequent colonics, or high enemas, can aid in the treatment of ADD or ADHD for preteens?

20:46:58
kristina
To clear out scabies, use an essential oil like peppermint, lavender or tea tree oil. Other essential oils that are reported to work well to eliminate scabies are anise and ylang-ylang.

20:48:17
kristina
Tom, not as a stand alone treatment, but certainly as a part of a health optimizing program that includes a gut healing diet, such as I write about in Ten Days to Optimal Health, fish oil, probiotics and immune supporting herbs.

20:48:59
Tom P
Do you know of any articles on the 'net that discuss this?  I have a mom-friend who has an ADD child.

20:49:18
kristina
Yes, peppermint oil can be used in an enema on a regular basis. Use 2-4 drops of peppermint oil per quart of water.

20:50:19
Jan H
Thank you!

20:51:14
kristina
OK, back to the subject of the spring cleanse. How many of you are considering partaking of a spring cleanse?

20:51:24
kristina
Have you ever done a spring cleanse before?

20:51:29
kristina
What was your experience?

20:51:55
TomE
I am planning to get something set up with DeeDee on my return and travel into Wisconsin late March/April.

20:51:59
kristina
To start with, it is important to prepare for your spring cleanse in order for it to be supportive of the body and not more harmful. 

20:52:32
kristina
For instance, if you have a fatty liver, you can damage your liver if you jump into a spring cleanse without proper preparation.

20:52:42
kristina
Excellent, Tom.

20:53:15
Jackie P
What would proper preparation be if you have liver issues?

20:53:30
Dave
Also will be in Madison for a series. What about nutrition  with cleanse?

20:54:05
kristina
A water-only spring cleanse is a LOT of work for the body: as toxins are released, the liver, the gallbladder, and the colon all need to be optimally functioning in order to remove those previously stored toxins from the body.

20:54:43
kristina
If toxins that are stored in the bodily tissues are released but the body cannot eliminate them easily and fully, you can damage organs.

20:55:46
kristina
To prepare for a spring cleanse if you have liver issues, start by taking a tri-weekly enema series that includes a coffee enema.

20:55:59
kristina
Add beets or our AF BetaFood to your daily diet.

20:56:04
kristina
Add lemon juice to your daily diet.

20:56:14
kristina
Make sure you are exercising regularly.

20:56:57
kristina
Make sure your Vitamin D levels are optimized; have a Vitamin D test; use a Vitamin D supplement or a Vitamin D tanning bed as we offer at the Optimal Health Network.

20:57:33
kristina
Make sure on the days you do not take enemas that you empty your bowels fully. If not, use our GB3, which is also support for the liver and the gallbladder.

20:57:57
Jackie P
Are the beets for Betaine HCl? 

20:57:59
kristina
Reduce, better yet, eliminate sugar, dairy and grains from your daily diet.

20:58:35
Jackie P
All dairy?  Or just pasteurized dairy?

20:59:07
kristina
My book, Ten Days to Optimal Health, lays out a 35-day plan that is a &quot;spring cleanse&quot; for the last five days preceded by 30 days of preparation. I do have some of my book on the website.

20:59:25
kristina
You can also ask me questions on Facebook and you can always call the office and speak with DeeDee.

21:00:26
kristina
Having a hair tissue mineral analysis before you cleanse is also a good idea as it offers you a map to how to optimize your individual biochemistry and it tracks your detoxification needs and progress.

21:00:53
Dave
Next chat in two weeks?

21:01:08
kristina
Wow! It is 8 o'clock. I must go now and continue my parenting duties. Warm wishes to all of you. If I missed anything, please email, Facebook, call.

21:01:19
Tom P
Thanks, Kristina...

21:01:25
kristina
For some, only pasteurized; for other, raw, too.

21:02:04
Jackie P
Thank you, Kristina.
