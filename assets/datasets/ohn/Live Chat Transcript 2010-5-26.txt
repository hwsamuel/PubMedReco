hi

kristina
Hello!

13:00:46
JohnS
hi

13:01:32
JohnS
have you read Robert Gray's Colon Health Handbook?

13:02:25
kristina
Yes, I have read Robert Gray's Colon Health Handbook.

13:03:11
JohnS
From a physiological point of view, I find the book very illuminating. I never thought that the colon was the exit point for lymphatic fluids.

13:03:38
kristina
Say more.

13:03:38
JohnS
Do you know of any other books that discuss the colon like that?

13:04:25
kristina
Not off the top of my head, but I will think about it as the chat goes along and into the future and post on Facebook, if not here today, okay?

13:04:39
JohnS
ok

13:05:08
George
what is an elongated colon, Kristina?

13:07:19
kristina
Sorry, I got knocked off so I missed the last two minutes.

13:07:31
DrAlbert
Hello, All.

13:07:35
kristina
An elongated colon pertains to the sigmoid colon.

13:07:59
JohnS
do you know of any way to get an accurate and precise picture of how much hard fecal matter/old mucus we have, aside from a body CT scan or colonoscopy?

13:08:12
JohnS
I really would like to know what my colon looks like and how much old matter is in there instead of subjecting myself to x-rays from CT scans.

13:08:34
kristina
Some say it is genetic; when one has it, it can cause lots of pain.

13:08:56
kristina
Hello, Dr Albert!

13:08:59
George
can it cause blockage?

13:09:10
DrAlbert
Hi, Kristina

13:10:15
kristina
An elongated colon is thought to be fairly common in the elderly, so I tend to think that it is caused by lifestyle and is most often not inherited.

13:11:07
kristina
It depends if the colon is also twisted, kinked, or telescoped.

13:11:18
kristina
George, do you have an elongated colon?

13:11:25
George
I recently had a colonosocopy and the doctor mentioned this to me.

13:11:27
George
yes

13:12:13
Charles N
Kristina, is there a preferred length that a coffee enema should be inserted to get maximum benefits?

13:12:30
kristina
Today I would like to talk about herbal protocols in the control of microbial infections and/or dysbiosis. 

13:12:44
DrAlbert
oops... 

13:12:50
kristina
12-15 minutes is the preferred length to hold a coffee enema.

13:13:16
George
I get backed up so I have to rely on a weekly enema series.

13:13:34
Jo
Is there any way to avoid the caffeine buzz that I get after my coffee enemas?  

13:13:48
kristina
Dr. Albert, as I just posted but you may have lost it, I am going to weave through the other discussions here, herbal protocols in the control of microbial infections and/or gut dysbiosis.

13:14:04
DrAlbert
thanks... I think I hit the wrong key... :)

13:14:13
kristina
Jo, how much coffee do you use when you take a coffee enema?

13:14:30
Jo
I use 5 tablespoons for 10 cups of water

13:14:50
kristina
George, do your bowels move on their own each day throughout the week? If not, how often?

13:15:23
Charles N
Sorry, but I meant to ask the distance in inches to insert the coffee enema.

13:15:53
George
on occasion before the weekly enema once 

13:16:06
kristina
I start my clients out with about 1 T to 1 cup of brewed coffee, made with 1 quart of water and 4 T of made-for-enema coffee, which is then mixed with 1-3 cups of water. 

13:16:32
kristina
So, I would say, use much less coffee as a coffee enema ought not cause a &quot;buzz.&quot;

13:17:38
Jo
I'll try that smaller amount :) 

13:17:41
kristina
It is ideal if the coffee implant solution stays within the rectal area and the sigmoid colon, so 4-12 inches at most.

13:18:00
George
kristina, I exercise daily, drink water and green tea

13:18:49
kristina
Might you take an enema, George, at least 2-3 times a week? And, we need to see to it that your bowel is emptying out daily.

13:19:43
kristina
You could use even more frequent enemas for this purpose or we could work with you to determine what the optimal diet and supplement protocol would be to encourage your body to empty the bowel daily.

13:19:47
Jo
Kristina, I wanted to thank you for helping me about a month ago. we talked on the phone and you helped me choose the right enema equipment. You are very kind and informative, and I appreciated that so much! :D 

13:20:19
kristina
You are very welcome, Jo. Thanks for thanking me!

13:20:42
George
One enema or a series a couple of times per week?

13:21:15
kristina
Most of us think that if we have gut issues going on, the most important first step is to use a probiotic formula.

13:22:44
kristina
This may be right for some, but for others, with imbalances in the gut flora, the most important part of treating a gut microbial imbalance is to start with immune-enhancing herbs.

13:23:05
kristina
An enema series a couple of times a week.

13:24:06
George
Kristina, I have your CD &quot;10 Days to Optimal Health.&quot;  Thanks for the advice.

13:24:27
kristina
Antimicrobial strategies can take several forms:

13:24:49
kristina
First, what micro-organisms are involved in the gut imbalance?

13:25:37
kristina
We can determine this by taking a Gastrointestinal Health Panel.

13:27:05
kristina
First, back to the immune-enhancing herbs (I got a little ahead of myself)...

13:28:45
John D.
Hi All

13:29:34
kristina
Echinacea root is particularly safe and and useful as it especially works on the input side of immune activation, mainly phagocytosis.

13:31:06
kristina
Its influence will help the body to resolve the presence of micro-organisms which are having a deleterious effect on health and yet it will not stimulate the autoimmune processes.

13:31:23
kristina
You are welcome, George.

13:31:39
kristina
Does that sound like a workable idea, to take more enemas each week? 

13:31:59
George
Yes I will try that.

13:32:02
John D.
Quick question?

13:32:33
kristina
Or would you like to work with us so that you are more likely to move your bowels daily without the added support of the enema?

13:32:40
kristina
Go ahead, John. And welcome.

13:33:29
John D.
Did you ever hear of a situation where constipation can cause pain in the limbs?

13:34:25
kristina
Andrographis and Astralagus are two other immune-enhancing herbs that we work with at the Optimal Health Center to improve immunity in cases of dysbiosis.

13:34:33
kristina
Yes, absolutely.

13:35:03
John D.
I get constipated and get pain in my arm. goes away when not constipated.

13:35:53
George
I would like to become regular and any help would be appreciated

13:36:03
John D.
Same here

13:36:38
kristina
There are many reasons why constipation contributes to pain in other parts of the body.

13:37:31
kristina
Many of our waste products, when reabsorbed, cause inflammation.

13:37:43
kristina
hormones, toxins, metabolites

13:37:55
kristina
Pressure on the colon can cause inflammation in the rest of the body.

13:38:31
kristina
John, do you take enemas?

13:38:36
kristina
How does that go for you?

13:39:12
kristina
George, have you done a hair analysis with us?

13:39:28
John D.
Not yet, have to start. By the way, thanks for the welcome, nice to meet you.

13:39:30
kristina
They are relatively inexpensive and give us a lot of information on your individual body.

13:39:48
kristina
you are welcome. Nice to meet you, too.

13:40:01
George
no

13:40:04
kristina
Try one enema and see how it goes. Let me know.

13:40:25
kristina
When the colon doesn't empty daily there can be many causes:

13:40:45
kristina
a lack of minerals in the body - magnesium, etc.

13:40:55
kristina
a lack of fiber in the diet

13:41:10
kristina
an underfunctioning thyroid

13:41:18
kristina
dehydration

13:41:22
kristina
and more.

13:41:38
John D.
Looks like I've come to the right place.

13:41:46
kristina
We want to address the cause of your particular constipation, which is where the hair analysis comes in.

13:42:04
kristina
Certainly, the enema does clear the colon and is an excellent tool.

13:42:06
DrAlbert
Kristina, do you have any advice for a 61 year old woman who has been in constant pain from a rectal mucosal prolapse?

13:42:14
kristina
However, we want the whole body to be functioning well.

13:42:26
kristina
ouch!

13:42:33
DrAlbert
no kidding!

13:43:49
DrAlbert
She's had very little success with the various colorectal surgeons she's consulted with at KP.

13:43:53
kristina
Normally, the rectum is securely attached to the pelvis with the help of ligaments and muscles. This attachment firmly holds the rectum in place. Various factors, such as age, long-term constipation, and the stress of childbirth, may cause these ligaments and muscles to weaken, which means that the rectum's attachment to the body also weakens. This causes the rectum to prolapse, meaning it slips or falls out of place. Occasionally, large hemorrhoids  (large, swollen veins inside the rectum) may predispose the rectum to prolapse. 

13:44:15
George
Kristina, I am 62.  Could too many enemas been the cause for the elongated colon?

13:44:21
kristina
Do you know more specifics about her situation that you could share here?

13:44:43
kristina
George, it is much more likely that constipation is the cause of the elongated colon, not enemas.

13:45:12
kristina
I doubt that enemas would cause an elongated colon but how many enemas have you done throughout your life and in what frequency?

13:45:20
George
Thanks. I have had problems since childhood.

13:45:33
JohnS
so, how does one fix an elongated colon?

13:45:54
John D.
Kristina, I will check out your website, be a regular on these chats, and be in touch. I feel better already. :) See you at the next chat. Work calls here.

13:45:57
kristina
My experience is that most people are able to improve their health; your colon issue can be improved.

13:46:07
kristina
Thanks, John!

13:46:27
George
when I was a child, weekly, and now still weekly

13:46:49
kristina
To &quot;fix&quot; an elongated colon, we need to address all the possible issues and see what happens: 

13:46:49
DrAlbert
She had a adrenalectomy 3 years ago... the lack of cortisol output requires steroidal supplements.  This developed after some hems were discovered... no surgical intervention, yet.  And it's not the rectum, but the rectal mucosa that is prolapsed.

13:48:10
kristina
eat a healthy diet, optimize hormone levels - adrenal, thyroid, male and female - address inflammation, bowel dysbiosis, frequency of meals, blood sugar.

13:49:59
kristina
Back to antimicrobial strategies can take many forms:

13:51:40
kristina
Eliminate the unwanted micro-organisms involved, inhibit the growth of further micro-organisms, and reduce the infectivity of the host body.

13:52:18
kristina
We need to address the hemorrhoids.

13:53:10
kristina
We have excellent results with our Super Salve

13:53:22
kristina
Hi Iowa Alan

13:53:50
kristina
Also, we need to make sure her bowels are easily emptying daily.

13:53:51
IowaAlan
Ok, quick Q: has anyone had trouble getting the 750cc double bardex inserted?

13:53:57
DrAlbert
I'll take a look... it's a topical &quot;non stinging&quot; preparation?

13:54:01
IowaAlan
Hello Kristina

13:54:04
kristina
yes

13:54:21
DrAlbert
She visits the bathroom at least 5 or 6 times most mornings.

13:55:38
kristina
Also, she would do well to determine the levels of all of her hormones so that her body is in a constant state of regeneration and not busy with internal and/or external stressors

13:56:10
DrAlbert
Her endocrinologist seems to be ignoring her... maybe it's time for a change.

13:56:25
kristina
She needs to build up as much healing energy as she can in order to have the biological resource to shift her condition.

13:56:51
kristina
Would she take one of our Hormone Panels?

13:57:12
DrAlbert
thanks for the chat.... see you next time.... btw, you do have my email address from last year, in case you want to contact me?   I'll ask her about the panel.

13:57:43
kristina
She has diarrhea?

13:58:18
DrAlbert
no, just &quot;loose&quot;' sometimes... tiny &quot;pellet-like&quot; stool expelled.

13:58:25
kristina
If so, she needs to get rid of it immediately; she won't be able to heal with a chronic case of diarrhea.

13:58:51
DrAlbert
I agree, but that's not a problem... it's the frequency.

14:00:13
kristina
Yes, I agree.

14:00:38
DrAlbert
I have to run..... again, thanks.

14:00:41
DrAlbert
bye

14:00:57
kristina
Okay, it is already 1:00. Thanks all for coming today. I look forward to more contact on future Live Chats, Facebook, Twitter, calls to the office, visits, etc.
