Hi all...

13:02:44
randyu
Do you have anything new to tell us today, DeeDee?

13:02:45

Hello DeeDee, Randy and Bonita.

13:03:09
bonitafw
Hello everyone.

13:03:41
DaveC
Hi all.

13:04:08
deedee
Welcome Dave. 

13:05:01
DaveC
Just back from a colonic, appropriately!

13:05:32
Karen
What herbs should be avoided with diverticulitis?

13:05:40
deedee
Does anyone have a topic that they want to talk about today?  I have been so busy that I haven't even had time to come up with a topic for today.

13:06:42
bonitafw
Hello again everyone. I'm new to all of this so I just wanted the opportunity to listen in and learn... Any topic is interesting to me...

13:06:57
joseph
Hello Karen.

13:06:58
randyu
Diverticuli, why do certain foods not go with that?  

13:07:36
deedee
Karen, I would approach it more from the herbs you would want to take that would help with diverticuli.

13:08:46
Karen
OK, that would be helpful... plus, I have duodenitis, esophagitis and a hiatal hernia.

13:09:51
Karen
Did I also mention laryngopharangeal reflux?

13:10:40
deedee
I use burdock, cat's claw, golden seal, echinacea to name some.  Before really recommending specific herbs I would want to get a health history and find out more about your health situations.

13:11:34
deedee
Karen, since you do have a lot of issues, we would definitely need to talk.

13:12:13
Karen
OK... thank you.

13:14:12
Karen
What would you recommend instead of omeprazole?  This seems to help some.

13:14:18
deedee
Diverticulitis is an infection of the diverticuli.  Diverticulosis are pockets in the colon where food, etc., can get trapped, and then cause the infection. [see also  diverticulosis discussion in 8/12/09 live chat] 

13:14:43
deedee
Karen, please email me and we can discuss a bit further.

13:14:55
DaveC
Don't many have it but show no symptoms?

13:15:48
Karen
I have a 3.5-cm growth on the thyroid (nodule), which I would love to shrink without surgery... at least try.  It has &quot;questionable cells&quot; on it.  Of course, the MD's want to take out the right side of the thyroid...

13:16:08
Karen
I'll e-mail you, for sure.  Thank you very much, DeeDee.

13:16:52
DaveC
One of my aunts had it. She was an enema believer but don't know if she treated it with them.

13:16:55
deedee
Karen, there are definitely things we can do for the acid reflux and to support the thyroid.  I use a lot of herbs and glandulars for those things.

13:18:00
deedee
Diverticulosus many times does not create any problems at all.  Many people may not even know they have it.  It is when is gets infected or inflamed that it causes some major problems and pain.

13:18:43
Karen
Where does systemic detox fit into the above issues?

13:18:53
deedee
Karen, have you had any saliva and stool tests done for your GI problems?

13:19:05
Karen
Yes, I have.

13:19:52
Karen
Plus a pH probe and...

13:19:58
deedee
I like to get to the root cause of these things, so testing can many times be very helpful to find out more about what may be causing these issues.

13:20:20
Karen
an upper endoscopy EGD.

13:20:30
deedee
OK, great. We can start by looking at those results to see if I can use some of that info and go from there.

13:21:27
Karen
Took biopsies and said everything's clear outside the two swollen places in the stomach and esophagus... and said to &quot;come back in 2 years&quot;...

13:21:43
Karen
I will let you see the results...

13:21:49
deedee
Have any of you ever had any form of cancer, and what did you do about it?

13:21:49
Karen
Thank you.

13:22:10
deedee
Great, Karen!  Thanks!

13:23:43
randyu
DeeDee, you have my intake form and the HTMA sample is on the way.  It went out in the mail Monday, 1/23.  The intake form gives you much info about my case.  We'll go from there when it's time to consult.  I have to run; until next time, thanks again.

13:23:50
randyu
Bye, all...

13:24:10
deedee
Thanks, Randy. Talk to you soon! I currently have some clients who are working through different cancers.

13:25:22
Debbi
Can estrogen dominance in men and women be responsible for some of the cancers out there today?

13:26:35
deedee
I will soon be talking with Dr. Vickers who worked directly with the Gerson family and treating cancer with coffee enemas.  I will let you all know what he says.

13:27:17
bonitafw
I've never had any cancers as of yet, thank God... I'm currently suffering with hypothyroidism and started taking Levothyroxine 50mcg two months ago. I just picked up my third month of this medication. I've read a book on hypothyroidism.

13:27:43
deedee
Yes, definitely estrogen dominance and hormonal imbalances in general are suspected of being the cause of several cancers.  Toxicity is another big cause and many people have both.

13:27:45
bonitafw
I'm wishing I could treat it naturally rather than with medication.

13:28:06
joseph
I'm interested in your advice to Karen about the acid reflux, DeeDee, as I take omezaprol for it every day.

13:29:33
deedee
Bonita, there sure are a lot of people out there with your thyroid situation as well.  Some people do OK on the meds, and some do not.  Some start out OK, but the cells and tissues do not receive the hormone correctly and then there are problems again.  

13:30:06
Debbi
I work to eliminate as much estrogen out of my system as possible and it helps reduce that ridiculous halo of extra fat... plus makes me feel more healthy.  There is a thyroid/estrogen dominance connection, right?

13:31:28
bonitafw
I am scheduled to retake blood test in February however I've been feeling much better. I've always been healthy and it's hard to realize that now at 46 years old I have to be dependent on a medication... I just feel it may lead to other problems.

13:31:55
deedee
We do a hair tissue mineral analysis to test the if thyroid hormone is actually getting into the cells where it would be effective.  Since the doctors only test the blood, they do not see the active hormone levels.

13:32:48
bonitafw
Okay, this may be something I need to look into as well... Thank you.

13:32:51
deedee
Debbi, that is great.  There is definitely a connection between estrogen dominance and thyroid, plus adrenals and blood sugar also.

13:34:36
deedee
Bonita, on our website there is more explanation of the tests we offer, and we don't have them all listed, so if you do have more questions, just email me.

13:35:05
Debbi
My boys are late 20's, early 30's... Is the lack of progesterone levels causing their hair loss with the toxic environmental estrogens they are consuming, with their age-related beginning decline of testosterone?

13:35:53
bonitafw
Yes, I'll do that, however I've been surfing your website. It's so very interesting for someone who wants to learn more about inner cleansing...

13:36:49
deedee
Debbi, yes, I am definitely seeing more hormonal imbalances in men.  Much of this is caused by adrenal stress and fatigue which causes imbalances in the male and female hormones as well as thyroid.

13:36:58
joseph
OK, DeeDee. I'll get in touch with you later.

13:37:10
deedee
Thanks, Joseph.

13:37:48
Debbi
Do you recommend a general systemic cleanse you offer before getting tested for anything related to the above?

13:38:32
deedee
Cleansing is a very important aspect of hormonal balance because the liver is what manages the excess of hormones in the body.

13:40:08
deedee
If that is not working well, along with the colon being backed up and toxic, the body cannot process the hormones, so cleansing  is the first step to prep the body for further healing.

13:40:49
DaveC
I have thinning hair, but not from a family trait as far as I know.

13:41:41
bonitafw
I've been using an enema kit that I have here at the house. I've taken two enemas this week (so hard to keep the water in) but it's getting better, however I'm wondering about the better enema kits. Does it make a difference in the quality of kit that's used?

13:42:10
deedee
Debbi, no, I do not recommend a cleanse before the test necessarily, but if you are on steroid or hormone treatments, we do like to wait until that is out of the system before testing if we can.

13:42:25
deedee
If the person absolutely cannot be off of their meds, we have to test with them on and we just get the results of them on the hormones.

13:43:18
bonitafw
I've also taken colonics at a clinic once, but it's so far away that I wanted to do something here at home, however if it makes a big difference I think I'll just take the drive...

13:44:25
deedee
Bonita, some of the things that make for a better and easier enema is equipment.  A good nozzle, or even colon tube which reaches higher in the colon, can make the enema more comfortable and easier to take more water.

13:45:00
DaveC
I'm blessed with a couple of therapists within 20 miles.

13:45:21
deedee
Also, we have a pump system that helps with this call the Smooth Flow syringe and hose system.  It comes with some of our kits or you can purchase it separately, and fits on our systems.  Where did you get yours and which one is it?

13:46:00
bonitafw
Okay, I'll order one. Thanks again...

13:46:12
bonitafw
I had already been reading about them.

13:46:25
deedee
Bonita, you can definitely do a great job at home once you learn how to do if effectively.  You could go see a therapist for a professional one, just so you can see how you can feel once you are cleaned out.

13:46:42
bonitafw
I got my kit at the local drug store... It's a cheapy...

13:47:15
deedee
OK, maybe when you are ready, you can upgrade and get a system that will do what you'd like it to and be much easier and more effective.

13:47:17
DaveC
Sadly, that's all you find in stores -- if they carry at all.

13:47:48
deedee
Yes, many drug stores do not even carry them anymore.

13:48:01
DaveC
Huge change from the pre-'70s or before.

13:48:02
bonitafw
Yes, I think it's an investment that I need... 

13:48:22
bonitafw
Yes, CVS does here in Houston...

13:48:27
deedee
I will help you to pick out a good one for you in your price range.

13:48:44
bonitafw
Thank you.

13:49:09
DaveC
Fleet now dominant.

13:49:26
deedee
Yes, and Fleets do not do much, do they, Dave?

13:50:25
DaveC
Strictly first aid with no alternative (bag or can) at hand.

13:51:16
deedee
Some people's exposure to enemas has only been Fleets, so they may not know the extent of the cleanse you can get with a good therapeutic enema series like what we do here.

13:51:23
deedee
Hi, Larry.

13:51:33
deedee
Any new subjects for today?

13:51:44
Larry
Took a brief nap and almost missed the chat!

13:51:52
DaveC
Yes, I know and appreciate the difference, lol.

13:52:02
deedee
What made you so tired today?

13:52:26
Larry
Hit the gym very early!

13:52:56
deedee
I guess you deserved a little nap then!

13:53:44
deedee
At least here keeps me so busy that I never hit that slump where I feel tired during the day.  Does anyone experience that midday slump?

13:54:04
Larry
When does the online sale start this month?  I need to re-order a few suppositories.

13:54:22
deedee
That again brings us back to blood sugar, adrenals, and thyroid.

13:54:33
bonitafw
I don't, especially if I've had a good night's rest.

13:55:44
deedee
That is great, Bonita.  Hopefully that means that you have pretty level blood sugar throughout the day.  Do you eat every 3 hours or so?

13:56:22
deedee
Larry, the sale should start on Jan. 27 and run through the end of the month.  You should see the newsletter any day now.

13:56:27
bonitafw
Not really but sometimes I do unconsciously...

13:57:06
deedee
Eating protein throughout the day can help people maintain good blood sugar levels and to give the body energy.

13:57:43
Debbi
Do you recommend whey protein isolate the most?

13:58:51
deedee
Whey protein is very good for those that can tolerate whey, otherwise we do carry a protein mix that is mainly rice protein and contains no allergens for people who have problems with whey.  I do not recommend soy at all.

13:59:47
Debbi
Do you think toleration of whey, etc., has anything to do with blood type,  i.e., eat right for your type?

13:59:48
deedee
Does anyone else have last minute questions before we wrap it up?

13:59:51
DaveC
Next Wednesday for chat?

14:00:25
deedee
Debbi, I do work a little bit with blood type diets, but not completely.  It does seem to have some affect, though.

14:00:25
bonitafw
No, but I'll be in contact and I'm looking forward to next chat...

14:00:31
bonitafw
Thanks for everything...

14:00:38
bonitafw
Bye everyone...

14:00:47
Debbi
Thank you. You've been a great help, as always!

14:00:52
deedee
Thank you all for joining and hope to see you next time.
