Hi hope all is well in Madison

19:56:23&nbsp;
Carol45
:)  Good evening everyone. 

19:56:23&nbsp;
kristina
Hi all! Feel free to chat or begins threads. I will be back in 5 minutes. 

19:56:38&nbsp;
TomIA
Hello

19:57:10&nbsp;
michael b
my fondest hopes for all for a great SPRING.

19:57:26&nbsp;
TomIA
Soon as it starts

19:58:27&nbsp;
TomIA
Still trying to get rid of the last of the snow in Iowa

19:58:43&nbsp;
michael b
to have a great spring, whenever it shows up.

19:59:16&nbsp;
Lisa
Hi Dave! How was your trip?

20:00:51&nbsp;
kristina
Wisconsin is not under 100 inches of snow any longer but it is still cold. The weekend was fabulous.

20:01:18&nbsp;
Lisa
I'm glad I live in Texas!!!

20:01:29&nbsp;
Carol45
Glad to hear you had some good weather in Wisc.

20:01:49&nbsp;
TomIA
I caught the 11 inch snow in Minnesota last week during a trip

20:02:43&nbsp;
TomIA
Did not last long but can't seem to get away from it

20:02:48&nbsp;
Carol45
Illinois has been having rain, rain, and more rain.

20:03:31&nbsp;
Carol45
Kristina, do you still have any goats?

20:03:49&nbsp;
kristina
I see that you all received the newsletter. Any thoughts about the content?

20:04:02&nbsp;
TomIA
Does anyone find water temperature affecting fill and retention of water?

20:04:26&nbsp;
kristina
No, we sold all of our goats last fall. I miss them, especially in the spring because the last 3 years we had the joy of caring for the baby goats.

20:04:52&nbsp;
Lisa
The baby goats were adorable!

20:04:53&nbsp;
kristina
I find the warmer the enema water is, the better. What about you Tom?

20:04:57&nbsp;
Carol45
I saw the 'kids' at the farm last week end.  They are so darling. 

20:05:13&nbsp;
kristina
Are you getting raw goat's milk, Carol?

20:05:28&nbsp;
Carol45
Yes.  still practically living on Kefir. 

20:05:56&nbsp;
kristina
I sent the newsletter, with the forum reminder, to 5444 people. I thought we might be swarming with people.

20:06:25&nbsp;
TomIA
I have been trying to use 100-104 degree water it seems to work better, read where you cool off through the series but cooler seems to be harder to get a good fill and retain a bit less.

20:06:27&nbsp;
kristina
I drink about 1/2 gallon of raw milk daily. It is a very convenient and healthy food to live on.

20:06:38&nbsp;
michael b
lisa, from the last chat ,i was impressed that you knew the name of conductor of the san francisco symphony.

20:06:48&nbsp;
Dave
Problems logging in here. Missed last couple months. so outa practice, but HI all.

20:06:50&nbsp;
Carol45
The time should be good for most people, maybe early on the west coast.

20:06:56&nbsp;
kristina
Hi Dave. Welcome.

20:07:24&nbsp;
Lisa
Michael, that's because I'm a professional classical musician!

20:07:40&nbsp;
TomIA
Is the 32FR 70D colon tube available in longer lengths?

20:08:08&nbsp;
kristina
What else are you eating these days, Carol, besides the Kefir? How long does the kefir last? How often do you have to drive to the farm.

20:08:57&nbsp;
Dave
Looking forward to ILL-WIS trip next week. Keep weather decent please.

20:09:25&nbsp;
kristina
Unfortunately, it is not.

20:09:36&nbsp;
kristina
Have you tried the 42 FR Silicone Colon Tubes with Delrin Cap?

20:09:51&nbsp;
Lisa
I'm fighting a bad cold now, and I have to get ready to play in a recital April 20th! What a bummer!

20:09:56&nbsp;
TomIA
I was in Kansas till today and head for Ft Lauderdale for work tomorrow may see the sun a bit more I HOPE! Should get something for the effort

20:10:22&nbsp;
kristina
Lisa, have you tried taking a few coffee enemas and not eating any dairy or sugar?

20:10:45&nbsp;
TomIA
I have the shorter 42FR but have not had much luck with it yet.  Using the 30" 32FR for now 

20:11:01&nbsp;
Carol45
Beef, chicken and eggs, and pork from the farm.  Organic veggies from the co-op.  Make Kefir daily and drink 8-10 ounces in AM and with lunch.  Sometimes in evening. 

20:11:04&nbsp;
Lisa
I ran out of enema coffee! My diet has improved a lot.

20:11:22&nbsp;
Dave
Lisa, don't forget your bags! 

20:11:34&nbsp;
Lisa
True Dave!!

20:11:39&nbsp;
kristina
Maybe you can get some enema coffee with the upcoming sale. Well done on the dietary changes.

20:12:02&nbsp;
kristina
Sounds like you are doing well, Carol. How are you feeling these days? How is the stress level?

20:12:26&nbsp;
Lisa
My cold could be gone by the time it gets here. But that would be a good problem to have! LOL!

20:12:33&nbsp;
Carol45
I definitely need to get back into my 'coffee' routine.  

20:12:37&nbsp;
kristina
Tom, why do you desire a longer colon tube?

20:12:49&nbsp;
TomIA
What insertion length should you use on colon tube for coffee enema?

20:12:50&nbsp;
Dave
I could use fresh coffee resupply too, maybe on trip.

20:13:13&nbsp;
Dave
Good question Tom.

20:13:14&nbsp;
kristina
There are different thoughts on how far to insert the colon tube for the coffee enema.

20:13:30&nbsp;
Lisa
I'll still order the coffee when it's on sale.

20:13:42&nbsp;
Carol45
Knock on wood, I have avoided the office colds.  Really think the probiotics and kefir have helped keeped them at bay. 

20:13:44&nbsp;
Dave
Hint!!

20:13:52&nbsp;
kristina
I believe that it is important to first clear out the colon, then to implant the coffee with a tube that is inserted about 12-18 inches into the colon. 

20:14:20&nbsp;
TomIA
I was looking at the 48" in the Delrin cap if I get better use with the shorter one. Do not think I am getting enough water in deep enough for a good cleanse.  

20:14:26&nbsp;
kristina
Once my new website is launched, you will be able to read a new detailed description of how to take a coffee enema.

20:14:28&nbsp;
Lisa
I haven't had a cold all winter. Now it's a spring cold.

20:14:31&nbsp;
Dave
How about us afraid of more than 6, kris?b

20:16:14&nbsp;
kristina
Here is an excerpt:

20:16:15&nbsp;
TomIA
After Dee Dee's help I am getting better with the 32FR at first foldback was a major issue. Getting better with each try

20:16:16&nbsp;
kristina
lie down on your left side, pull your knees up, and gently insert the nozzled enema hose or colon tube 4 to 6 inches into your colon, being very careful not to injure the colon wall or tissues. If you are using a detachable nozzle, do not insert it beyond the end of its stem. Whenever you feel any resistance, stop, pull back slightly, reposition the tube a little (change the angle), and continue. Sometimes allowing a little coffee to flow in will help with the tube insertion. If you can only comfortably get the tube in a couple of inches, leave it at that. Never force anything. Special attachable nozzles with rounded, bulb-like ends on a four-inch stem pretty much dictate a safe insertion. A wider (#32 or so) silicone colon tube is also very safe.

20:16:55&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, colon tubes do take practice.

20:17:47&nbsp;
Carol45
I finally got my 'pump'.  And naturally just love it. :D 

20:18:12&nbsp;
kristina
As far as fully cleansing the entire colon, I find that it is using the multiple enemas or the enemas series that is key, along with taking in the 2-4 quarts of water. 

20:19:03&nbsp;
Carol45
How is the new website coming?

20:19:08&nbsp;
kristina
Carol, do you mean a smooth flow syringe and hose system with the in-line pump?

20:19:18&nbsp;
Carol45
That's the one.

20:19:47&nbsp;
Lisa
Guess what! In November, I'm going to Milan Italy,Venice and Switzerland! I bet you know what kind of a bag I'll be taking! LOL!

20:19:51&nbsp;
TomIA
After using the colon tube and 3 round enema series I find that I have a movement in as short as 2 hours and up to 8 hours.  After a hydro at OHN I normally go 24 or so hours before a BM.  Don't know if I do as well with enemas or at least not yet

20:20:22&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, the in-line pump is another tool to move the enema solution deeper into the colon. How much water do you take, Tom? And, how many enemas do you take in a row? 

20:20:27&nbsp;
TomIA
The flowmaster unit is the only way to go.

20:20:52&nbsp;
Lisa
I agree Tom! The flowmaster is great!

20:21:08&nbsp;
kristina
Hmm, that is interesting. Let me think about that a bit.

20:21:18&nbsp;
Carol45
Lisa, will you be performing on your trip?

20:21:36&nbsp;
kristina
Flowmaster Cleansing Programs

20:21:39&nbsp;
Dave
Thanx Kris. Think 6 inches and 2 quarts the most we have had from earliest days as kids and afraid to go further. 

20:22:05&nbsp;
kristina
There is often no need to go further with the nozzle. 

20:22:15&nbsp;
kristina
Tom, how often do you take enemas?

20:22:17&nbsp;
TomIA
I normally take 3 or 4 in a single night series, 1st one is small cleanout then 2 or 3 more. I have taken 3 qts but sometimes 2 is all I manage so will do the 4th round.

20:22:25&nbsp;
Lisa
I'm meeting a singer there, so I have a good connection. So far nothing is planned for a performance.

20:23:07&nbsp;
michael b
Kristrina, i have wondered, is the coffee solution good for all parts of the colon?

20:23:21&nbsp;
kristina
I am very blessed as I have actually had Lisa perform in my own house.

20:23:38&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, however, 

20:23:49&nbsp;
Lisa
I loved performing for you and your family!

20:24:03&nbsp;
TomIA
Has anyone used organic green tea as an implant?

20:24:43&nbsp;
kristina
here is another excerpt:

20:24:43&nbsp;
Lisa
I have used green tea in an enema and it's very soothing. I loved it!

20:24:45&nbsp;
Dave
Another good question Tom.

20:24:46&nbsp;
kristina
There seem to be as many different claims for how to properly administer a coffee enema as there are petals on a daisy ? or alternative healthcare practitioners' titles. The subject of which way is the "right" way arouses strong opinions ? I've even read of coffee enema advocates at a health conference almost coming to blows over whether the enema is to be taken while lying on the right side or the left side.

20:25:23&nbsp;
kristina
I have not used green tea. What do you know about its therapeutic benefits as an enema implant?

20:26:01&nbsp;
TomIA
What I have read so far speaks about antioxidants primarily

20:26:22&nbsp;
kristina
The one detail that is consistent among health practitioners is that you need to hold the coffee for 12 minutes.

20:26:58&nbsp;
TomIA
I think you had a short paragraph in your 10 days book, found most info online sites

20:27:14&nbsp;
Carol45
Kristina, what is Cranial Sacral Therapy? Is it anything like going to a chiropractor?

20:27:25&nbsp;
Dave
Just to add to coffee positions: legs-up as good for retention?

20:27:38&nbsp;
TomIA
I have read some comments about flushing out after the coffee enema what do you think

20:28:26&nbsp;
Lisa
Calol45, I've been wondering about that too.

20:28:43&nbsp;
kristina
I do go into detail how to take a coffee enema and the physiology of the coffee enema in my movie, Cleansing, Coffee Enemas and Colon Tubes.

20:28:57&nbsp;
Lisa
Carol45. My typo!

20:29:32&nbsp;
Carol45
The movie is great, very well worth it.  

20:29:46&nbsp;
TomIA
I have the DVD it is good

20:30:06&nbsp;
kristina
No, cranial sacral therapy is not like going to a chiropractor.

20:30:12&nbsp;
Dave
Have it too.

20:30:33&nbsp;
kristina
It is a hands-on therapy. There is no manipulation.

20:30:49&nbsp;
kristina
I have had a handful of sessions and always enjoyed it immensely. 

20:32:16&nbsp;
TomIA
Does anyone have trouble retaining olive oil implants?

20:32:49&nbsp;
Lisa
I never had a problem, but it was such a small amount.

20:32:50&nbsp;
kristina
I had one in March with a woman who felt that my lower colon had literally not been receiving enough of a blood supply for years, the part of my body that I have had recurring issues with. I have been extremely healthy since then, 3 1/2 weeks ago. Each therapist will be different.

20:33:00&nbsp;
kristina
More on coffee enemas:

20:33:05&nbsp;
kristina
The coffee enema is capable of removing circulating toxins and partial metabolites for one specific reason, and that is that the coffee enema not only dilates bile ducts - which Gerson knew - we now know, from the work of Wattenberg, Sparnins, and Lam at the University of Minnesota, Department of Pathology, Minneapolis, that coffee stimulates an enzyme system in the liver, glutathione-S-transferase, that is capable of removing a vast variety of electrophiles from the bloodstream. 

20:33:47&nbsp;
michael b
carol45, lisa, i also wondered about cranial sacral therapy, but was afraid to ask.

20:33:51&nbsp;
kristina
The role of the coffee enema in dilating the bile ducts is why there is controversy about where the coffee needs to be delivered. 

20:34:18&nbsp;
kristina
I have learned that it is the blood vessels in the lower colon that absorb the coffee in the enema solution and thus dilate the bile ducts.

20:34:35&nbsp;
TomIA
My first try with olive oil was @1 cup but it did not last long on the retention scale

20:34:48&nbsp;
Carol45
There is a difference in chiropractors too, depending on which school they have gone too.  Given a choice, I like the "Palmer Method" - it seems more gentle.

20:34:54&nbsp;
Lisa
Why be afraid to ask? Kristina will answer anything, right Kris?

20:35:14&nbsp;
kristina
The author of the coffee enema article on my new sites recommends that you take a second enema series later in the day to release the resulting toxins from the earlier coffee enema.

20:35:17&nbsp;
Dave
Is the cranial mostly physical or mental in effect? We know enemas can be both.

20:35:36&nbsp;
kristina
I recommend Cranial Sacral Therapy. 

20:35:52&nbsp;
Carol45
The increase in blood supply to a region makes a big difference.

20:36:03&nbsp;
TomIA
Some of the articles on doing a flush enema after the coffee is based on removing any toxins that are transfered into the colon, not sure if this is accurate

20:36:07&nbsp;
Lisa
Would love to learn more about it.

20:36:34&nbsp;
kristina
yes, i will.

20:36:52&nbsp;
kristina
It is both mental and physical, Dave.

20:37:04&nbsp;
kristina
My page just cleared out. If I missed any question, let me know.

20:37:13&nbsp;
TomIA
So you would agree with the flushing series later in the day after coffee series

20:37:21&nbsp;
kristina
Right, Tom. I think it makes sense.

20:37:51&nbsp;
TomIA
You think you should wait a few hours though rather than shorter time?

20:38:14&nbsp;
Carol45
Kristina, I know we are all looking forward to your new site.  Any idea when we might see it?

20:38:43&nbsp;
ltrail
Hello, My name is Dale

20:38:52&nbsp;
kristina
Welcome, Dale

20:38:57&nbsp;
ltrail
Thanks

20:39:04&nbsp;
Lisa
Hi Dale! Nice to have you here!

20:39:13&nbsp;
ltrail
Thanks

20:39:20&nbsp;
TomIA
What I have seen speaks of doing shortly after the coffee implant is done.

20:39:27&nbsp;
Carol45
Glad you join us. 

20:39:38&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, I would, Tom. I also also thinking that given what you said about your own enemas, you might benefit from taking a second series anyways.

20:39:42&nbsp;
Dave
Kris, since effects same as an enema, good. 

20:39:51&nbsp;
ltrail
Thanks Carol45 and all

20:41:36&nbsp;
kristina
I would take the second set of cleansing enemas 4-6 hours after the first.

20:42:00&nbsp;
kristina
Dale, do you have any questions or thoughts you would like to share?

20:43:14&nbsp;
ltrail
wow. do I.

20:43:56&nbsp;
ltrail
First of all, I'm glad that I found Optimal Health Network and its products and education.

20:44:05&nbsp;
kristina
Carol, our new site will be launched any day but then again, it could be a while. There are many, many technical issues that aren't foreseen until you are tackling them. She is a beauty, though. I can't wait for you all to see it.

20:44:09&nbsp;
Lisa
We have another 15 minutes, so there is still time to ask!

20:44:13&nbsp;
michael b
i try to read all you print, if i am right, you suggest eating a binding agent 30 min. before the second coffee enema, like china chlorella,or cilantro.

20:44:15&nbsp;
Dave
Just to cover old ground: are many here as clogged in travel as me even brief trips? Taking this  personal, lol.

20:44:30&nbsp;
kristina
Thanks, Dale. Welcome again!

20:45:02&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, I do, Michael. Thanks for chiming in about that.

20:45:34&nbsp;
kristina
Chlorella

20:45:36&nbsp;
ltrail
I wished that I took my Cadillac (silicone bag, hose, and tube) with me on a business trip but didn't.  I eventually needed help from local agencies.  So next time, I surely will

20:45:54&nbsp;
kristina
What happened?

20:46:53&nbsp;
Carol45
Dave, there are just some things that I do much better at home!  Even a short trip away from home 'clogs' me up.

20:46:53&nbsp;
ltrail
My business trip caused unexpected problems in my regular routine

20:47:15&nbsp;
kristina
silicone bag

20:47:27&nbsp;
ltrail
So I called upon locals in Texas (Houston) for help

20:47:39&nbsp;
kristina
The hospital or a colon hydrotherapist?

20:48:10&nbsp;
ltrail
I obtained a referral from my own DR and had it faxed to an agency in Houston.

20:48:22&nbsp;
ltrail
they helped in Texas style

20:48:50&nbsp;
ltrail
nurse health care

20:49:21&nbsp;
ltrail
Otherwise, my next day with clients would have been not so nice

20:49:31&nbsp;
Lisa
That's good, since you need an RX in Texas to go to a colon hydrotherapist.

20:49:41&nbsp;
ltrail
yes, Lisa

20:50:01&nbsp;
Dave
Yes, Carol, hotels/motels sure not enema friendly solo. Better clean out before and after.

20:50:03&nbsp;
Lisa
I live in Texas, so I know.

20:50:18&nbsp;
ltrail
Hello Lisa.  you know

20:50:25&nbsp;
Carol45
The only good thing I can see about an RX is that you can include it in medical expenses on the taxes. 

20:50:47&nbsp;
ltrail
Thank you, Carol45

20:50:52&nbsp;
michael b
Kristina, you are most welcome, I am just glad to know I am understanding this    correctly.

20:51:04&nbsp;
kristina
Here is a story that might assist you, Tom:

20:51:08&nbsp;
Lisa
I never thought of that Carol45!

20:51:29&nbsp;
kristina
The recently released larger and longer silicone colon tube has been a great benefit in my routine.  As you know I routinely flush with four quarts of water at a temperature that just starts to sting my wrist. Then I follow up by completely inserting the new silicone colon tube. The frankincense and myrrh goat milk soap is dissolved in a pint jar and introduced in the supply container to reach the colon nearest the appendix. ( I know this from a colonoscopy exam, the technician pointed out on the monitor) 

20:51:38&nbsp;
kristina
the soap solution then works its way down stream and soothes the entire colon. I should mention here that I coat the nozzle I use with Super Salve. The nozzle is large enough to be retained in the rectum with a hole in the nozzle to permit the large colon tube to be introduced and let it work it''s way all the way in the colon. I then flush the entire colon with filtered water and that has many benefits. Most importantly, I can sleep better than at any other time. I see this procedure as a cleansing as well as a totally relaxing experience. The warmer than normal water temperature as I see it, causes blood to circulate through the entire blood stream keeping the vessels open and flowing smoothly. My pulse rate is a surprise to medical personnel for my age. 

20:52:29&nbsp;
kristina
frankincense and myrrh soap

Super Salve is great.

20:55:16&nbsp;

Super salve was a blessing to find. 

20:55:27&nbsp;
Lisa
Gee, May 14th is a sad day for me because that is when my father died! It will be nice to look forward to this chat on that day

20:55:53&nbsp;
kristina
Of course, it wasn't made for taking enemas but I am continually amazed at its therapeutic qualities. 

20:56:34&nbsp;
kristina
I am glad, Lisa. 

20:56:47&nbsp;
Carol45
The time has flown by.  Great chatting with all of you.  Look forward to 'seeing' all of you next time.  It will be a couple of days before my birthday - only 2 more years to Medicare!!!

20:57:05&nbsp;

Happy, Happy, Happy Birthday, Carol.

20:57:09&nbsp;

I am Medicare, but no free enemas or colonics, sadly, LOL.

20:58:33&nbsp;

If you have something quick, I have a few more minutes. We will post the chat archives on the new site at some point.

21:00:23&nbsp;

what happened to the vital living center cookbook?

21:00:29&nbsp;

Great song, huh Michael!?

21:00:57&nbsp;

We ran out. The author died and it didn't continue. If you email me, I might be able to hook you up with a copy or a single recipe.

21:01:07&nbsp;

Carol45
I love the cookbook too - just don't have enough people to cook for! lol 

21:03:31&nbsp;
kristina
Email me if you are looking for a specific recipe. I had recipes in my old CD version of my book but now that you mention it I think we took many of those out based on some editorial guidance. I still don't like the idea.

21:03:40&nbsp;
Lisa
Dave is going to DeeDee soon, right Dave?

21:04:03&nbsp;

I was shocked at eating uncooked food, whever you said raw I kept thinking you meant organic (in the electronic book)

21:04:35&nbsp;
Sawdis
the best meat I can find is grade AA, no pesticide, no hormones and grain fed

21:04:35&nbsp;
kristina
Okay, I am going to shut the chat down now. Thank you very much, every one for joining me tonight. No, I meant raw. I eat most of my food raw. I also mean organic, and raw.
