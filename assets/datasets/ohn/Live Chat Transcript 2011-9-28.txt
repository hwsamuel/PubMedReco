Hello Deedee.

13:00:19
randyu
I am glad to see you don't recommend flu shots.

13:00:24
Andrea B.
Hi all.

13:00:30
randyu
Hi Andrea.

13:00:33
deedee
Welcome Randy and Panda

13:00:39
panda s.
Thanks.

13:00:40
deedee
and Andrea.

13:00:44

Hi everybody.

13:00:46
randyu
Hi Panda.

13:01:06
deedee
Does anyone have a topic to discuss or questions for today?

13:01:36
randyu
What about diet for IBS patients?  Is there one on the website?

13:01:42
deedee
Regarding flu shots, I have never gotten one and have never gotten the flu either, so I am going to stick with that.

13:02:09
randyu
What is your secret, DeeDee, for not getting the flu?  Prevention?

13:03:25
deedee
A diet for IBS isn't specifically mentioned on our website, and I would take a few things into consideration when recommending a diet, 

13:03:27
deedee
but basically a diet free of dairy, gluten, sugar, and stimulants (like caffeine, alcohol, etc.) would be a good place to start.

13:04:03
randyu
What about flu prevention?

13:04:12
Andrea B.
Hi DeeDee, I'm Italian and I have 28 years old. Probably next week will book a session of colon hydrotherapy, but I'm very embarrassed. Is the first time.

13:04:56
deedee
I believe a strong immune system is the secret to not getting the flu since we are all going to be exposed and we don't know what strain we will be exposed to

13:05:07
deedee
 and many flu shots do not seem to contain the strain that you may be exposed to, so you never can be sure you are vaccinating for the correct bug.

13:06:39
deedee
Hi Andrea. Many of my clients are also embarrassed the first time, but if your colonic place is like here, the client is always covered and the practitioner has seen everything, so none of it shocks us at all.  Nothing to be worried about there.

13:07:09
Larry
DeeDee, can you touch on the use of probiotics in either an enema solution or suppository?

13:09:03
deedee
Hi Larry. I use probiotic solution in clients in an implant after a cleansing session. I use our powder probiotic with warm water.  I have also started using them in my coconut oil suppositories.  This seems to work pretty well.

13:09:17
Andrea B.
My problem is flatulence. My therapist uses a closed system Hydro San Plus. Is it safe?

13:10:37
deedee
In the suppository, I use about 1 tablespoon of coconut oil and about 1/4 - 1/2 tsp. of the powdered probiotic.

13:11:18
Larry
Since I already have your Ortho caps, would one be the correct amount to use in the coconut oil suppository?  I see you beat me to the question. LOL

13:12:40
Joseph
Hello DeeDee, all.

13:12:41
deedee
Yes, we use a closed system here also  and Hydro San Plus is a good machine.

13:12:58
deedee
Hi Joseph.

13:13:17
Susan B.
I'm new here, and to the world of colon health in general. Wondering if you might touch on the connection between hormone balance/imbalance (and resulting depression) and colon health?

13:13:40
Larry
Would the probiotic degrade in a suppository if made ahead of time and stored in the fridge?

13:14:04
Susan B.
I'm perimenopausal if that helps at all. :) 

13:14:10
deedee
Larry, you could use an opened up capsule of the OrthoBiotic but that capsule contains probiotics for stomach and small intestine also, not just for the large intestine/colon.

13:14:25
deedee
Welcome Susan B.

13:14:31
Susan B.
Thanks DeeDee.

13:15:10
Joseph
Yes, I would just like to ask about how to restore good bacteria in the system... especially after a dose of antibiotics...

13:16:09
deedee
Hormone imbalance is very common, believe it or not.  Depression many times is misdiagnosed and it is really thyroid issues which are connected to adrenal exhaustion and causes the imbalance in the first place.

13:16:55
Andrea B.
28 years is too early to have a session of colon hydrotherapy, or is the right age?

13:17:25
deedee
Colon cleansing can be used as part of a protocol for hormonal health because the liver processes the excessive hormones in the body, so the liver has to be healthy and the liver relies on the colon to process its waste,

13:17:54
deedee
so a clean colon will assist with the detoxifiying process of the body trying to process the hormones more efficiently.  Does that kind of answer your question?

13:18:27
Susan B.
Yes, precisely. That's where my mind was headed, thanks for confirming.

13:18:47
Susan B.
What else can I do to help my lazy liver?

13:18:51
Larry
Joseph... I've been through 2 heavy sessions of antibiotics in the last few months.  Daily enema sessions and the Ortho probiotics REALLY helped!!

13:19:04
deedee
Andrea, 28 yrs. old is not too early.  With the diets that we have and the toxic exposure, plus the fact that we don't all have 2 - 3 bowel movements a day, means that our colons need some help just like our teeth need to be cleaned periodically.

13:19:21
deedee
You were thinking correctly, Susan! 

13:20:16
deedee
Larry, you should write a testimonial about your ordeal and what you did to get your body back to good health.  I think that would help a lot of people.

13:21:08
Joseph
Is that a pill, Larry?

13:21:31
Larry
I simply followed your advice and it was right on target... big thanks to OHN!

13:21:50
Larry
Yes... on the pill form.

13:22:05
deedee
Susan, a good cleanse like our Core Restore program will help the digestive system and the liver both.  I will put many of my clients on this to jump-start the system, and then some ongoing liver support may be needed for awhile while we rebalance the hormones.

13:22:52
Joseph
Okay, thank you Larry. I'll give that a shot.

13:23:10
deedee
Joseph, do you think you would try an implant or suppository with probiotics in them?

13:23:56
Joseph
I could do that too, DeeDee... maybe I can call Friday.

13:24:09
Susan B.
Sounds like that should be where I head next. Thanks, DeeDee.

13:24:13
Larry
Question on the Core Restore vs. Vit-Ra-Tox... I bought the latter since I found out it contained enough product to use for two cleanses.  Is one better than the other?

13:24:29
deedee
Yes, joseph, give me a call on Friday.

13:24:40
deedee
You're welcome, Susan.

13:25:16
Joseph
You bet. Thank you too, DeeDee. I will eat some yogurt in the meantime.

13:26:01
deedee
Core Restore is one that is a bit easier to do for most people because the fast is only for 2 days and you use a shake mix also on all 7 days.  The Vit-Ra-Tox is harder for some to do because it is a 5 to 7 day fast.

13:26:58
deedee
Core Restore also teaches people how to eat more healthy since it gives you categories and types of foods to eat that can be carried over after the cleanse.

13:27:59
Andrea B.
DeeDee, for my cleansing I use two or three enemas about every two weeks, but after a few days I still feel bloated. The colon hydrotherapy might be useful?

13:28:32
Larry
I followed the guidelines from the website for the 3-enema series with the last being the coffee enema.  I also used DeeDee's recommendation for the coconut oil suppositories.  I had a very serious infection problem from a spider bite and was on massive antibiotics.

13:30:03
deedee
Yes, it may be useful, but it sounds like you do a pretty good job at home.  It may be more to do with your diet - food allergies, digestive system not working in general.

13:30:07
deedee
You may find the Core Restore helpful, but we can dig into more specifics if you want to.

13:30:50
deedee
Yes, Larry did a great job in healing himself!

13:31:33
deedee
There is a recommendation on how we do enemas here.  It is in the April e-newsletter.

13:32:52
deedee
Does anyone in this group usually get a flu shot?  Why or why not?

13:33:53
Susan B.
I did once and was very sick afterwards. I'd rather take my chances now!

13:34:15
Larry
I get one every year and have for 30 years.  The only year I missed... I got the flu!  Even with my new approach to health, I'll likely stay with the flu shot.

13:35:08
deedee
Ssusan, another question regarding hormones: Have you ever had your hormones tested? - because we do offer perimenopausal testing if you want to know what is going on, and I would also highly recommend hair testing.

13:36:08
deedee
Larry, I think that is the case with some people. They have always gotten them and feel safer getting them - I feel the same way - only opposite!

13:36:36
Susan B.
Well, I've done part of the above. I have no income and very limited resources so I did a hair analysis, cortisol panel, and just one estrogen measurement. Waiting for the results back from you folks any day now...

13:37:41
deedee
I have also heard of people having a reaction to the shot and feeling like they actually get the flu after they have gotten the shot  - I just think we do not know enough about all of the situations surrounding the vaccine.

13:37:44
Joseph
Ah, very good, Larry. Thank you. I think that is probably the best way to take a series.

13:37:47
deedee
My parents do have to get their shots each year also!

13:39:12
deedee
OK, Susan, I realize who you are now.  It will be great going over the results with you! 

13:39:54
Joseph
I try to get a flu shot every year, DeeDee, on account of my asthma.

13:39:54
Susan B.
Uh, yeah, maybe from your side of the picture...  :) 

13:39:57
deedee
We are revamping our website to make it even better,  so if anyone has suggestions as what you would like to see, let me know.

13:40:47
Larry
Do you have the magnesium oil spray listed yet?

13:40:52
Joseph
Every so many years... I may get the symptoms... but they usually only last 2 days or so.

13:41:14
deedee
Well, Susan, it will be good for you to know so we can move forward and so something about it, right?

13:41:45
Susan B.
That's for sure. I've been suffering too long and am willing to do whatever it takes.

13:42:09
randyu
Checking out, all. Have a good day/week.

13:42:19
Susan B.
You too, Randy.

13:42:21
deedee
Larry, I do not think it is on the website yet - probably when we do the new website. The suppository trays are, though! 

13:42:51
deedee
Thanks, Randy. Are we consulting this week?

13:43:42
randyu
No, I need to wait at least until early next week, DeeDee.  Thanks.

13:43:55
deedee
OK, Randy, just let me know.

13:43:57
randyu
I will email you.

13:44:10
deedee
Thanks Randy.

13:45:40
deedee
Andrea B.,  are you constipated also?

13:46:05
deedee
How large of enemas do you do and do you seem to have good results?

13:46:11
Andrea B.
No, constipated no, but some gas.

13:46:58
Larry
After much use, I've noticed a white deposit forming on the inside of my silicone hose.  Does this serve to inhibit bacteria growth or should I be concerned about cleaning it out?

13:47:23
deedee
Can you pinpoint what causes the gas for you?  Does it occur constantly and is it really foul-smelling or uncomfortable?

13:48:18
deedee
Larry, I am not sure what caused that.  Is it salt or mineral deposit, or what does it look like?

13:48:45
Andrea B.
When I get up very early in the morning.

13:49:20
deedee
Andrea, do you eat before bed?  If so, what do you eat?

13:50:56
Larry
It could be salt or soap? I do rinse very well after use and have soaked it in a weak bleach solution.  It will come out using mechanical means but it's a lot of work.  It's a light white coating.

13:52:07
deedee
It is probably mineral deposit - maybe soap residue, and as long as you disinfect (don't use bleach!), it should be fine.

13:52:53
Joseph
No bleach?

13:53:27
Larry
Well... I was out of GSE and wasn't sure about using hydrogen peroxide.

13:53:48
deedee
No, bleach is toxic and since silicone is porous it will absorb some of that and get into your body.

13:53:57
Andrea B.
I don't eat before bed.

13:54:03
deedee
You can use peroxide.

13:54:29
Joseph
OK, no bleach.

13:54:33
Larry
Thanks... I guess I should have checked.

13:54:55
deedee
Andrea, try eating protein right before bed. This will stabilize blood sugar through the night and stabilize the digestive system.

13:55:51
deedee
I forgive you, Larry. You have a pass this time.

13:56:15
Joseph
:p 

13:56:21
Susan B.
I've heard/read that when the digestive system has to work overnight (such as after eating bedtime snacks), it becomes overworked?

13:56:54
Larry
Hmmm... The last time I had a couple of hard boiled eggs and a couple of beers before going to bed... well... it didn't work out too well! ;) 

13:57:10
deedee
You only want to eat a small amount of protein which actually stabilizes blood sugar and helps the adrenals.  Just a small amount.

13:57:25
Joseph
But you got your, protein Larry. lol 

13:58:07
deedee
I am sure hard boiled eggs and beer were quite interesting!  One hard boiled egg and no beer is what I would recommend!!

13:58:17
Andrea B.
OK, DeeDee, but a colonic session is recommended?

13:59:24
deedee
Yes, a colonic would be good.  You could then see what is going on and hopefully the colon therapist would be able to give you some good feedback on what she sees.  We can always consult afterwards also, it they do not seem to have good info for you.

13:59:37
Larry
Thank you, everyone, for another good session.  Catch you next month.  Go Pack Go!!

13:59:51
deedee
Thanks Larry.  Talk to you soon! 

13:59:52
Joseph
Take care,  Larry.

13:59:59
Susan B.
Bye Larry.

13:59:59
Joseph
Da Bears.

14:00:08
Andrea B.
Bye Larry.

14:00:56
Joseph
Be well, all. Nice chat. I will call you Friday DeeDee.

14:01:03
Andrea B.
Usually how long does a session of colon hydrotherapy last?

14:01:27
Andrea B.
Bye Joseph.

14:01:36
Susan B.
Bye Joseph.

14:02:31
deedee
Our first timers take about 1&frac12;-hour appt.  After that, only about 1 hour.  The actual session probably takes about 40 min., but there is explanation, intake consult, etc.

14:02:42
deedee
Thanks Joseph - see you next time.

14:04:13
deedee
Andrea, good luck on your first colonic - let me know how it goes.

14:04:16
Susan B.
You too. Looking forward to chatting with you.

14:04:17
Susan B.
Bye.

14:04:26
deedee
Bye Susan.

14:04:28
Andrea B.
Bye.

14:04:37
Susan B.
Bye Andrea.

14:05:13
deedee
Andrea, I fill my clients anywhere between 3 and 10 times depending on how full the person gets on a fill and how quick the release is.

14:05:28
deedee
Good luck, Andrea!

14:06:06
deedee
Talk to you next month or email me.

14:06:16
Andrea B.
OK, probably next Friday... my first session.

14:06:30
deedee
Great - let me know how it goes.

14:06:37
Andrea B.
OK, many thanks, DeeDee.

14:07:46
Andrea B.
Bye... thanks for all! Good work!
