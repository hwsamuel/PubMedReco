Good evening everyone.

20:06:24
kristina
Welcome Larry! Welcome Randy! Sorry about the delay. Welcome David! 

20:06:31
Larry
Kristina... still snowing up there?

20:06:31
randyu
Hi all...

20:06:34
kristina
What's on your minds tonight?

20:06:52
kristina
Nope, the snow has stopped. It has been a lovely day!

20:07:08
kristina
I particularly enjoyed the fall colors against the white snow!

20:07:20
kristina
And, there is a beautiful, near full moon out tonight.

20:07:39
Larry
Going to be cold by morning!

20:08:22
kristina
Yes! 28 degrees, I believe.

20:08:58
Larry
Question on using the bifidonate powder.  How much product and water for an implant?

20:09:09
kristina
One subject I'd like to talk about tonight is constipation. Any of you three have any experience with constipation?

20:09:37
randyu
Yes I have, with alternate IBS and the opposite.

20:09:49
Larry
Only when using high doses of antibiotics.

20:10:35
kristina
4 billion colony forming units or 1 teaspoon of powder with one cup of water. Hold solution as long as possible, including all night.

20:11:00
Larry
Thanks.

20:11:11
kristina
Randy, are  you willing to share the details of your IBS and how you support your body?

20:11:44
kristina
Constipation is hard on us. In the U.S., laxatives and stool softeners are the two biggest selling medications, 2nd only to pain relievers. Constipation is quite common in our modern world for people of all ages.

20:12:51
randyu
I take Benefiber tabs every day; this helps; drink water; exercise.

20:12:58
kristina
So is colon cancer. In fact, colon cancer is the second most common type of cancer in the United States. Many scientific studies have shown that there is an increased risk of colon cancer in people who are chronically constipated.  The connection between bowel disease and constipation seems to be related to the fact that constipation dramatically increases what is called the bowel transit time, or the time that it takes food to go from the mouth, through the digestive system and out as stool as a so called &quot;bowel movement.&quot;

20:13:07
randyu
Some meds can help too.

20:13:33
kristina
How often do you take enemas?

20:14:03
kristina
The National Institute of Health reports that the &quot;normal&quot; range of bowel movements in a week ranges from 3 to 21.  This range shows just how extremely constipated many of us are.

20:14:10
randyu
Occasionally not very often; only if really bad.

20:14:28
kristina
At the extreme ends of this &quot;normal range&quot; you have bowel transit times ranging from 8 to 56 hours! Among most natural health practitioners, it is felt that the optimal bowel transit time is between 12 and 18 hours.

20:14:47
kristina
Slow bowel transit times raise the risk of colon diseases and contribute to health problems in part by increasing the amount of time that the colon content is available for re-absorption into the body.

20:16:18
kristina
Benefiber is wheat dextrin so I wouldn't recommend it generally.

20:16:35
kristina
Have you tried any other fiber products?

20:16:52
randyu
Citrucel, Metamucil.

20:16:56
kristina
Welcome, Joan!

20:17:11
kristina
Please feel free to chime in with your questions, comments, etc.

20:17:21
kristina
How did either of those work for you?

20:17:55
randyu
All work about the same, OK.  It goes in spurts; depends on diet, etc.

20:18:11
randyu
IBS is hard to lick; stubborn.

20:18:28
JoanS
Hi there... I have similar concerns - extremely slow bowel transit.  That's why I've turned to home enemas.

20:18:45
randyu
What do you think of the Fleet mineral oil or aloe vera enemas?

20:19:27
kristina
I hope you don't mind me talking more about the Benefiber. I am not criticizing your choice. I just want to explore the details here.

20:19:41
kristina
So, dextrin is a hydrolyzed starch made from various starches such as potato, corn, tapioca, rice, arrowroot or wheat. Wheat starch is a byproduct from extracting gluten from wheat. The wheat starch is sprayed with acid while being agitated and then suspended in water by the acids or enzymes. After maturing, the wheat starch is dried in a roaster where it is continually heated and stirred. The converted dextrin is then taken from the roaster and cooled. It is humidified before packing to keep the dextrin from getting lumpy or foaming. Heating times and acids vary depending upon the manufacturer and the final product usage. 

20:20:43
kristina
Please share your experiences, Joan. And, do you have any questions?

20:21:43
randyu
What about my question on Fleets?

20:21:54
Larry
I have another probiotic question.  Since I'm taking an oral probiotic in the morning and evening, can the use of a probiotic implant be excessive?

20:21:59
kristina
Wheat dextrin is considered &quot;gluten-free&quot; by the FDA's definition of less than 20 parts per million (ppm). Wheat dextrin is in fact a by-product of extracting the gluten from wheat but complete extraction is not guaranteed. Individuals who are gluten-intolerant should avoid wheat dextrin.

20:22:08
kristina
Yes, I will get to that.

20:23:44
kristina
I opt for using healthy oils for colon cleansing like olive oil, coconut oil - as in our essential oil suppositories - and even sesame oil.

20:24:06
kristina
Welcome P H!

20:24:59
kristina
Larry, I don't think a probiotic implant would be excessive.

20:25:07
Larry
Thank you. 

20:25:31
kristina
How often would you like to take the implant?

20:25:47
kristina
Why are you taking the implants?

20:25:58
JoanS
I've struggled with constipation for many, many years.  It seems like a product works in the beginning (fiber powders, magnesium citrate, cape aloe, other herbs) but eventually they stop working.

20:26:40
kristina
That is a very common experience, Joan, because those products often don't get at the cause of the constipation.

20:27:12
randyu
Joan is right, they only work for a while; then the cycle stars over again.

20:27:35
kristina
Finishing up on my notes about constipation from above (read the archive if you missed it): Like all mucous membranes, the interior surface of the colon is able to absorb certain substances. The longer food and microbial waste sit in contact with the colon wall the more opportunity there is for stagnation, purification and re-absorption of these wastes. It is also known that stool often contains many carcinogenic materials that when remain in contact with the colon wall promote cancer of the colon.

20:27:45
JoanS
I believe it's probably food sensitivities for me, but I'm still trying to figure them out.

20:29:14
randyu
Foods are the culprit for me too.  Some will trigger symptoms and cause IBS.

20:30:28
kristina
Also, some fibers irritate the internal walls of the intestines.

20:30:42
kristina
What foods are problems for each of you?

20:31:25
kristina
One way to work with foods to determine food sensitivities is the 10-Day Diet I developed.

20:32:04
P H
After throwing my back out with a quart enema I have just discovered that using a lot of water in an enema is unnecessary if you take a good amount of magnesium citrate (Oxyflush) to soften the waste first.  I use only 10 to 12 ounces of water with H2O2.

20:32:07
kristina
And, Joan, how is it going using enemas to deal with your constipation?

20:32:09
randyu
Asparagus, chili, greasy stuff; all things I love to eat.

20:32:42
kristina
I have not heard before of someone being sensitive to asparagus. What happens when you eat it?

20:33:19
randyu
The canned asparagus is what gets me... makes me go.

20:34:09
randyu
PH is right - some of us don't need to use much water in enemas; maybe a pint to a quart.

20:34:40
kristina
I bet fresh stuff would work for you. I would always avoid canned vegetables.

20:34:58
JoanS
Enemas are really helping me.  I'm only having time to do it once a week.  I'm trying to keep wheat out of my diet.

20:35:07
randyu
Salads and dressings will get me too; balsamic vinaigrette is great but the seeds are a laxative.

20:36:10
kristina
Yes, again, with the essential oil suppositories we are finding that some people do better cleansing their colon with little to no water.

20:36:59
kristina
Good idea, Joan, to keep wheat out of your diet. Gluten grains cause a lot of people to have a variety of health problems.

20:37:29
randyu
Yes, some doctors recommend suppositories first before enemas.

20:38:56
kristina
A good read on gluten sensitivities: The Reality of Gluten Sensitivity.

20:39:13
JoanS
I haven't tried making the suppositories, but I will give them a try.  I have to sign off now, but thank you for all the information you continue to provide us.

20:39:28
kristina
And, a more technical explanation:

20:39:34
kristina
Divergence of gut permeability and mucosal immune gene expression in two gluten-associated conditions: celiac disease and gluten sensitivity

20:39:50
kristina
You are very welcome, Joan. Thanks for joining us.

20:40:09
randyu
I also have to sign out for now, good night all, and thanks.

20:40:57
kristina
And, the issue I have with the Fleet aloe enema preparation is that it will only clear out the lower colon and the enema system is disposable. I think they are fine to use when necessary - when in a pinch.

20:41:06
kristina
Good night, Randy.

20:41:33
kristina
Larry or P H - do you have any issues you would like to discuss? 

20:41:34
randyu
Bye.

20:42:25
Larry
Not much tonight... We'll see how things work out Monday night.  9-0?

20:43:33
kristina
OK. I am going to close the chat now as I have a lot on my plate tonight (no pun intended!). Thanks for joining me.

20:43:54
Larry
Thanks for the chat.
