Welcome, Dave

19:58:51&nbsp;
HeidiT
I am 7 mos pregnant and wanted to ask if a hair analysis would be accurate

19:58:57&nbsp;
Dave
Hi Kris

19:59:45&nbsp;
kristina
Absolutely, and very useful for this period of your pregnancy and for your delivery and postpartum period. More info on Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis

Please go ahead with your questions and comments. I will also work to advance a new colon health related thread tonight.

20:01:35&nbsp;
kristina
good to know

20:01:58&nbsp;
HeidiT
I remember reading in your book that your poop should &quot;float.&quot;  What is the significance of this?

20:02:08&nbsp;
ac
Hi Kristina...this is a follow-up to my inquiry last chat...I have an intact healthy unused colon (ileostomy due to surgical error 12 yrs ago). I have been doing your suggested enema series...how long should I continue to do the series with the soap and salts?

20:02:21&nbsp;
kristina
One topic I want to advance tonight is the role of intestinal parasites

20:02:22&nbsp;
HeidiT
Mine have &quot;floated&quot; lately, but I ate corn on the cob yesterday and it looks like I had undigested COTB

20:02:38&nbsp;
jackiep
I just read your book.  Actually, still am, on my fourth reading.  I have several questions.  First, you said that some people needed to eat up to a stick of butter a day.  I wonder HOW exactly one does this without starchy food.

20:03:04&nbsp;
ac
do you also suggest any other additives to the enema series?

20:03:10&nbsp;
kristina
Did you know that the following list is commonly known to be symptoms of intestinal dysbiosis (microbial imbalance)?
          * Abdominal pain     * Myositis     * Constipation     * Anaemia     * Anorexia     * B-12 deficiency     * Rectal hemorrhage     * Blindness     * Hematochezia     * Hemoptysis     * Dysuria     * Central nervous system impairment     * Chest pain     * Chills     * Chronic fatigue     * Colitis     * Coughing     * Diarrhea     * Digestive disturbance     * Dizziness     * Fever     * Enlargement of various organs     * Headaches     * Vaginitis     * Jaundice     * Joint Pain     * Weight loss due to malnutrition     * Weakness     * Immunodeficiency     * Nausea / Vomiting     * Swelling of facial features     * Sweating     * Insomnia     * Skin ulcers     * Rectal prolaspe     * Mental problems     * Lung congestion     * Memory loss     * Night sweats     * Muscle spasms 

20:03:14&nbsp;
HeidiT
On parasites, I seemed to have a candida problem that has cleared up taking alfalfa (serendipitous as I'm using it for another purpose)

20:03:27&nbsp;
jackiep
Second, is pasture-raised butter a good choice if one can't get it raw?  Or is there little point if it's not raw?

20:04:24&nbsp;
kristina
AC, the best way to tell how well the enemas are working to keep your overall health in balance is to have a seasonal hair tissue mineral analysis.

20:04:49&nbsp;
ac
I have read about different recipes...do you suggest any one in particular..as my colon is unused

20:04:50&nbsp;
HeidiT
What, in your opinion, is better?  Raw, nonorganic milk / dairy products or organic pasteurized dairy?

20:05:03&nbsp;
kristina
For you, my best guess is to take daily enemas indefinitely 

20:05:26&nbsp;
kristina
Floating poop has enough fiber in it

20:05:44&nbsp;
kristina
Corn doesn't digest well for most people.

20:05:46&nbsp;
HeidiT
Ah, I see!

20:06:00&nbsp;
kristina
Hi Jackiep

20:06:12&nbsp;
HeidiT
I juice a lot of veggies (dandelion greens, celery as of late - possibly corresponding with the floating poop)

20:06:31&nbsp;
kristina
Butter....how to eat it without eating starches???

20:06:38&nbsp;
kristina
Melt it on all warm food.

20:06:44&nbsp;
ac
is aloe vera additive a good enema recipe to soothe the colon?

20:06:45&nbsp;
kristina
Eat it plain

20:07:01&nbsp;
HeidiT
I really appreciate finding out I am a fast oxidizer, I am supplementing with magnesium and it seems to be helping with pregnancy symptoms.

20:07:21&nbsp;
kristina
yes, pasture raised butter is a good choice, always

20:07:48&nbsp;
kristina
I am honored that you are on your fourth reading of my book, Ten Days to Optimal Health.

20:07:51&nbsp;
jackiep
kewl, cause can only get raw *milk* in PA, no milk products

20:08:24&nbsp;
HeidiT
I ask b/c I don't take my doc's advice and eat raw cheese from time to time when pregnant

20:08:39&nbsp;
ac
I also took your advice last chat to use ashwahala(sp?) and eleutro(sp) ... great suggestions....both have been very beneficial

20:08:58&nbsp;
HeidiT
Ashwaganda is the 1st one

20:09:05&nbsp;
kristina
As far as cleansing enema recipes, the most therapeutic is sea salt and either lavender or peppermint oil.

20:09:14&nbsp;
jackiep
you said you ate a lot of raw meat to heal yourself. I wondered what you meant by a lot.  I can tolerate nearly-raw beef, but usually only buy burger (which I cook to medium) or tough cuts (which I slow-cook).  

20:09:25&nbsp;
kristina
or the goat's milk soaps

20:09:26&nbsp;
jackiep
Pasture-raised beef is so expensive, I rarely buy steak.

20:09:56&nbsp;
kristina
Well done on the juicing, Heidi. I should have you juice for me, too!

20:10:17&nbsp;
HeidiT
I even juiced alfalfa for a couple of weeks - but it produces A LOT of gas!

20:10:26&nbsp;
HeidiT
But now I understand how cows thrive on the stuff

20:10:56&nbsp;
ac
I have used the castile soap with the peppermint for the 1st enema and sea salt for the 2nd....is it OK to do the enema every day? I haven't done the coffee yet...maybe tomorrow

20:11:00&nbsp;
HeidiT
Very rejuvenating

20:11:06&nbsp;
kristina
To find out your oxidization rate use a HTMA or Metabolic Typing

20:12:00&nbsp;
ac
do you recommend adding baking soda to the sea salt enema? and in what quantities?

20:12:18&nbsp;
kristina
All raw dairy is going to make pregnancy better, delivery better, and baby healthier! Go to www.westonaprice.org to learn more. Also, note that Sally Fallon has reviewed my book.

20:12:41&nbsp;
kristina
AC, can you tell us how your health improved using Ashwaganda and Eleuthero?

20:12:54&nbsp;
kristina
Welcome, Scott!

20:13:21&nbsp;
kristina
I have eaten as much as 1.5 pounds of raw meat daily.

20:13:23&nbsp;
ac
I am more energetic and I have overall better sense of good health

20:13:59&nbsp;
ac
The eleuthero tea is wonderful...even my husband is enjoying it

20:14:11&nbsp;
Scott W
Hello, Kristina.  I haven't been around for a while.  How is your Mom doing?

20:14:38&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, ground is cheapest grass-fed meat. A great source of very high quality meat is North Star Bison.

20:14:50&nbsp;
HeidiT
Here's an interesting article I found on a listserv.  I suspect the genes mentioned may have to do with differences in oxidation rates (esp. the DHA content of milk):  http://www.newswise.com/articles/view/511688/

20:15:17&nbsp;
jackiep
I get pasture-raised meat locally, but can't afford large quantities of steak until I'm not disabled  

20:15:28&nbsp;
ac
after doing the enema series daily, do you recommend colon hydrotherapy and how often?

20:15:34&nbsp;
kristina
 How Often To Take Enemas

20:15:43&nbsp;
kristina
you did it, smile!!

20:16:07&nbsp;
kristina
Of course, there is no single prescription for everyone. A hair tissue mineral analysis (HTMA) gives you a picture of what toxins are stored in your body and what toxins you need to remove. Using the hair analysis on a seasonal basis will guide you to the colon cleansing program that will most suit your needs.

20:16:31&nbsp;
kristina
Thanks for asking, Scott.

20:16:46&nbsp;
jackiep
ok, this might be a tad too chemistry-oriented, but my next quesiton is about the whole deal of getting enzymes in your food - enzymes being protein, protein being denatured by acid, I don't understand how enzymes in your food are going to do anything 

20:17:04&nbsp;
kristina
My mom, who had a hemorrhagic stroke in February, is actually doing very well.

20:17:09&nbsp;
HeidiT
I am glad to say I haven't suffered much from constipation at all this pregnancy - but that may have in part to do with the magnesium supplements I'm taking.

20:17:20&nbsp;
jackiep
once they hit your stomach, except act as an additional protein source, since denaturing enzymes makes them not fit their substrate anymore

20:17:29&nbsp;
kristina
She had been struggling much more than she is now because she had months of absolutely no energy.

20:17:42&nbsp;
HeidiT
I've had my &quot;problem area&quot; bleed a couple times and told my doc about it, but I struggled much more with it 1st pregnancy.

20:17:45&nbsp;
ac
can you please tell me what minerals, vitamins, nutrients, etc, are absorbed by the colon? and if it is unused...what happens?

20:18:22&nbsp;
kristina
I have found that Gotu Kola has helped her out tremendously

20:19:34&nbsp;
Dave
Re parasites Kristina mentioned earlier, a local colon hydrotherapist says she sees some returnees from Iraq/Afganistan full of them because of conditions. Usually takes three sessions to work them out. 

20:21:13&nbsp;
kristina
Gotu Kola supports the body's normal tissue repair process,  promotes normal development of connective and epithelial tissue, and promotes healthy blood vessels

20:21:54&nbsp;
Dave
Is it a supplement?

20:22:16&nbsp;
kristina
Enemas, done well, provide the same benefit as colon hydrotherapy so you only need to use colonics if you want to.

20:23:08&nbsp;
HeidiT
Kris I'm gonna go - but know that I can chat much more frequently on Wed nights now!  Maternity leave coming up...

20:23:22&nbsp;
HeidiT
I will try to remember to come in person for a HTMA.

20:24:14&nbsp;
ac
Will I be washing away any important linings or necessary mucus in my colon if I do daily enemas forever...will I affect the muscle tone of the colon with daily enema also?

20:24:16&nbsp;
kristina
Enzymes in food...Did you know that breast milk is enzyme-rich? Breast milk is in the raw, uncooked state which means it contains natural enzymes to aid in its digestion, thus requiring little digestive effort on the part of the infant.

20:25:21&nbsp;
HeidiT
That's absolutely true - And did anyone know that if a mom gets milk from a human milk bank it is GASP - pasteurized?

20:25:52&nbsp;
kristina
Enzyme-rich, which is easily digested food, can be assimilated with less energy expenditure

20:26:04&nbsp;
jackiep
I get little human breast milk in my current diet  ;)  There's a few &quot;alternative&quot; things I've never &quot;got&quot; (though your book cleared up some of them for me).  Enzymes, I don't get it.  Seems like it'd just be more protein after it hit the stomach acid.

20:26:28&nbsp;
HeidiT
There's a great group on Yahoo called Milkshare where you can get milk from milk donors and not get the pasteurized stuff - not to mention, milk banks are EXPENSIVE

20:26:57&nbsp;
HeidiT
Yeah, I have a hard time understanding the enzyme concept too.  Certain enzymes are active at different pH's

20:27:15&nbsp;
HeidiT
Take pepsin for example

20:27:44&nbsp;
kristina
I have been working with DiagnosTechs and their Gastrointestinal Health Panels.

20:28:02&nbsp;
HeidiT
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsin

20:29:01&nbsp;
kristina
I am simply amazed at how commonly I see Blastocystis hominis, entamoeba hartmanni and histolytica, Clostridium dificile, Toxoplasma and more in people's stools 

20:29:25&nbsp;
kristina
And, then, when we eliminate those organisms, how their health improves.

20:29:36&nbsp;
kristina
Gotu Kola is an herb

20:29:54&nbsp;
Dave
Thanks.

20:30:02&nbsp;
kristina
We offer it in liquid and capsules from Standard Process and Medi Herbs

20:30:10&nbsp;
HeidiT
What is a natural alternative to antibiotics for treating C. dificile?

20:30:15&nbsp;
kristina
Bye, Heidi.

20:30:23&nbsp;
kristina
Thanks much for coming on tonight.

20:30:28&nbsp;
HeidiT
Sorry I'm not gone yet

20:31:04&nbsp;
ac
hopefully in time my colon will be strong and I will think about a reversal of my ileostomy...so for now, daily castile enema followed by sea salts...and maybe coffee too.....what about the baking soda additive to the sea salts? any other additives?

20:32:06&nbsp;
kristina
The colon is thought to absorb sodium, potassium, water, acids, gases, some short-chain fatty acids metabolized from plant fibers and undigested starch, and vitamins synthesized by bacteria (biotin and Vitamin K). 

20:32:50&nbsp;
kristina
Hi Butch

20:32:52&nbsp;
jackiep
Next question is... I understand you recommend sea salt.  Generally, it has very little mineral content other than sodium and chloride, so if one has very hard well water, makes bone broths and has lots of organic veggies, seems the mineral are OK.

20:33:36&nbsp;
ac
with an ileostomy we are continuously dehydrated...the enemas help with the hydration too...also always take a vitamin each day

20:33:41&nbsp;
jackiep
I've been using Lite Salt for MANY years as I have a tendency to lose potassium, and it's half potassium.  I haven't started enemas yet, and because I have bp issues, I thought the solution should be isotonic, but wanted more K instead of Na.  

20:33:54&nbsp;
jackiep
So do you think Lite Salt would be inappropriate for this use?

20:34:08&nbsp;
kristina
I don't believe that enzymes are destroyed in the stomach.

20:34:28&nbsp;
jackiep
P.S. I *had* bp issues, I've been doing raw milk for a month, which has made it harder to tightly control bg, but has lowered my bp significantly - I'm off Lisinopril now.

20:34:40&nbsp;
ac
why sea salt???

20:34:51&nbsp;
kristina
Saccharomyces Boulardii 

20:35:24&nbsp;
jackiep
sorry my questions are so long - they don't fit in one message  ;)

20:35:41&nbsp;
ac
would iodized table sea in the enema work too?

20:35:51&nbsp;
kristina
accharomyces boulardii (SB) is a live yeast which scientific studies suggest protects the gut from amoebas and cholera, may keep candida from spreading, alleviates diarrhea caused by c. difficile, Crohn's disease and diarrhea of unknown cause in PWAs, and traveller's diarrhea. 

20:36:22&nbsp;
HeidiT
Does Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Brewer's yeast) offer similar benefits?

20:36:23&nbsp;
jackiep
hmmm... if food is solid, in a mass, in the stomach, some enzyme content would not be destroyed because it'd be physically protected from the acid... but liquid foods, probably not so much

20:36:32&nbsp;
kristina
Bifidonate or Primal Defense Probiotic Supplements</b>

20:36:43&nbsp;
kristina
 Ortho Saccharomyces Boulardii 60 count

20:37:31&nbsp;
HeidiT
That's kinda what I suspected - that the foods acted as sort of a &quot;buffer&quot;.  That's also why it's thought that probiotic foods (kefir, kombucha, etc) keep the stomach from destroying the probiotic bacteria

20:37:50&nbsp;
kristina
Sea salt contains about 80 mineral elements that the body needs.

20:38:12&nbsp;
kristina
Coconut water is also an excellent source of minerals.

20:38:22&nbsp;
kristina
especially potassium

20:38:45&nbsp;
HeidiT
ok now I'm gonna go - my back is killing me but will come back again.  Thanks, Kris

20:38:59&nbsp;
ac
thank Kristina...perfect answer.....it will definitely be sea salt? 

20:39:18&nbsp;
kristina
yes

20:39:37&nbsp;
kristina
Iodized salt is not recommended.

20:39:46&nbsp;
ac
Did you suggest coconut water for an enema additive?

20:40:36&nbsp;
jackiep
Does coconut water stop leg cramps?  Lite Salt is half potassium and stops them IMMEDIATELY (though is nasty).  And can be kept by the nightstand (which is good cause they mostly happen at night when I forget to salt my food for a while).

20:40:41&nbsp;
jackiep
&lt;- doesn't like salt

20:40:53&nbsp;
kristina
The adrenal glands, located one on top of each kidney, are stress glands that help us cope with internal and external stress factors, both physical and mental. Additional jobs of the adrenal glands include: Manufacturing mineral corticoids, which balance all the minerals (builders and communicators) in the body. For instance, mineral corticoids help insure calcium is absorbed into the bones and magnesium to the muscles. Mineral corticoids balance our electrical system with sodium and potassium so that our nerve impulses are adequate. Mineral corticoids manage our salt and water

20:41:26&nbsp;
jackiep
lite salt is not iodized, which I probably have an iodine deficiency cause I haven't use iodized salt in about 2 decades...

20:41:31&nbsp;
ac
I have been using the celtic sea salt...but if I do the enemas daily, I was thinking I could use table salt if i ran out of sea salt....I won't do that

20:41:34&nbsp;
kristina
In other words, if one has mineral balance issues, check your adrenal health

20:42:40&nbsp;
jackiep
&lt;- has adrenal issues (sister has severe salt-wasting form of  congenital adrenal hyperplasis) so I lose K FAST on low-carb - hence the lite salt for 2 decades now 

20:42:46&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, coconut water does stop leg cramps, but again, the adrenal glands are likely not functioning well and are so key to overall health that I would address this core issue

20:43:25&nbsp;
kristina
I am new to coconut water but it seems to me that it could be a fabulous enema implant.

20:43:27&nbsp;
jackiep
it's genetic in my case - hard to address with only one copy of the gene for the enzyme that makes cortisol and aldosterone

20:43:51&nbsp;
kristina
Hi Joe!

20:44:41&nbsp;
ac
besides the daily enema series...should I also do any type of implants to keep this colon healthy?

20:44:49&nbsp;
jackiep
can you buy coconut water canned?  I don't think I've ever seen it except from whole coconuts when I lived in FL

20:44:52&nbsp;
kristina
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) refers to any of several autosomal recessive diseases resulting from mutations of genes for enzymes mediating the biochemical steps of production of cortisol from cholesterol by the adrenal glands (steroidogenesis).

20:45:26&nbsp;
ac
is coconut water the same as coconut milk?

20:45:38&nbsp;
jackiep
yeah, I know  ;)  I did a seminar on CAH in grad school - my sister was the first person with the severe salt-wasting form who lived - she's all over the medical literature (not by name, of course)

20:45:52&nbsp;
kristina
Even with your genetics, you still want to optimize your mineralocorticoids

20:46:16&nbsp;
kristina
no, coconut water and coconut milk are very different

20:46:17&nbsp;
jackiep
no, coconut water is what you get when you poke holes in a whole coocnut and drain it, coconut milk is the liquid after mashing the meat of the coconut

20:46:55&nbsp;
kristina
I posted the definition for others to follow the subject!

20:46:58&nbsp;
jackiep
yeah, I'm starting on freeze-dried raw bovine adrenal cortex in a day or two (when they arrive)

20:47:03&nbsp;
ac
thanks..I am definitely new to this information...I appreciate it

20:47:16&nbsp;
kristina
Good question, AC

20:47:57&nbsp;
kristina
more information on parasite infections: In some people, intestinal worms do not cause any symptoms, or the symptoms may come and go. If you have some of these symptoms, it does not necessarily mean that you are infected. This symptoms are also signs of other diseases. Common signs and complaints include coughing, cramping abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence and diarrhea. In more serious infections, diminished sex drive, skin-itching, fever, nausea, vomiting, or bloody stools may occur.

20:48:03&nbsp;
jackiep
gotcha kristina, it's a pretty esoteric subject though  ;)  I never expect anyone to know what it is - my sister makes NO cortisol or aldosterone at ALL; I make *some* but not as much as people who have 2 good genes as I only have 1 good gene

20:48:14&nbsp;
kristina
Also, my home page will soon have a bit on parasites

20:48:26&nbsp;
ac
I am sure Whole Foods has coconut water

20:48:33&nbsp;
kristina
What are the main symptoms for you and your sister?

20:48:46&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, Whole Foods does. I just had some tonight from there.

20:49:31&nbsp;
jackiep
my sister?  her main symptom is she will die if she doesn't take aldosterone daily - lack of cortisol won't kill her, but she is usually either over or under medicated, thus has symptoms like Addison's or Cushings

20:49:41&nbsp;
kristina
Anyone else have anything they want to talk about as we will be wrapping this up for the month in 10 minutes.

20:49:52&nbsp;

kristina
The risk of being infected by pathogenic organisms through food and water is ever increasing. This is due to several reasons: immigration; frequent overseas travel; importation of vegetables and fruits; lack of a public health policy to screen food handlers for transmissible pathogens; outdoor and wilderness excursions; alternate lifestyles; agricultural pollution; pets at home, etc. 

20:52:40&nbsp;
jackiep
in my case, cows who poop near the well  ;)

20:52:43&nbsp;
Dave
How about bifudis as an implant, maybe only 2 or 3 ounce solution to retain?

20:53:02&nbsp;
kristina
Given the stress inherent in modern living, it is essential to give the body adequate nutrition to lessen chances of adrenal exhaustion; and, in many cases, to assist the healing of the adrenal glands themselves. Persistent fatigue, a racing brain, an inability to &quot;turn off&quot; the feeling of being stressed out, as well as a lack of vitality, all point to adrenal exhaustion. The good news is that by keeping your blood sugar balanced, by eating small amounts of food often, and by eating animal protein throughout the day, you can keep your adrenal glands in a vital state of health.

20:53:18&nbsp;
jackiep
from anyone, not just kristina, any advice for a newbie who is semi-scared of the whole enema thing and procrastinating?
