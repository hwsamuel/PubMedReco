hi kristina

12:57:28&nbsp;
kristina
Hi

12:58:19&nbsp;
kristina
How is your health these days?

12:58:25&nbsp;
Mike
I hope that you are doing well

12:58:28&nbsp;
Mike
I'm good

12:58:44&nbsp;
Mike
hi deb

12:58:49&nbsp;
Deb S
Hi

12:59:05&nbsp;
kristina
Welcome, Deb!

12:59:13&nbsp;
kristina
Hi Gino!

12:59:17&nbsp;
Deb S
Glad I got on

12:59:23&nbsp;
gino
hi Kristina

12:59:24&nbsp;
kristina
Me, too!

12:59:58&nbsp;
gino
I have just gone through a 4 month illness which completely stopped my digestion

13:00:15&nbsp;
Deb S
I have been doing coffee enemas for almost three years and I am still really fatigued.

13:00:45&nbsp;
kristina
Yikes to both of you!

13:00:48&nbsp;
Deb S
have been constipated for entire life also

13:00:56&nbsp;
Mike
I occasionally get colonics and usually take enemas weekly or every other week

13:01:08&nbsp;
kristina
Deb, it sounds like you are struggling with adrenal fatigue.

13:01:09&nbsp;
gino
peace to all of you. I wish you the best...

13:01:26&nbsp;
Deb S
could be i am under constant stress

13:01:35&nbsp;
Deb S
any suggestions?

13:01:43&nbsp;
kristina
would you consider having an adrenal stress index test?

13:01:50&nbsp;
Deb S
yes

13:02:04&nbsp;
Deb S
what about the constipation?

13:02:52&nbsp;
kristina
Can you tell me what you have done up to this point?

13:02:54&nbsp;
Mike
is there a problem with using enemas weekly or biweekly?

13:03:21&nbsp;
Deb S
enzymes, coffee enemas, better not perfect diet

13:03:48&nbsp;
Deb S
I have much physical pain also

13:04:44&nbsp;
kristina
For most people frequent enemas are not a problem. The best way to tell is to look at the hair using a hair tissue mineral analysis.

13:05:12&nbsp;
kristina
The reason we look at the hair is because it gives us a window into electrolyte or mineral levels over the past 3 months.

13:05:12&nbsp;
Deb S
i had one a year ago and it showed that i was protein deficient

13:05:26&nbsp;
TaraM
Hi Kristina, Hi Room!

13:05:31&nbsp;
Mike
hi

13:05:34&nbsp;
Deb S
hi

13:05:51&nbsp;
TaraM
Kristina, I have a question about progesterone

13:06:05&nbsp;
TaraM
I read somewhere that progesterone therapy can thin out your hair?

13:06:32&nbsp;
michael b
the best of autumn to you, kristina, and the rest of the chatters.

13:06:45&nbsp;
kristina
A person who is cleansing the colon frequently will be able to tell if it is beneficial or detrimental by seeing what the tissue levels of their minerals are over those past 3 months. 

13:06:53&nbsp;
Deb S
i have a thyroid problem and when that is out of whack my hair falls out

13:07:00&nbsp;
TaraM
oh ok

13:07:01&nbsp;
kristina
Thanks, Michael. It is absolutely gorgeous here.

13:07:20&nbsp;
TaraM
I haven't tested my thyroid function Deb

13:07:24&nbsp;
Marcy
Is there any natural way to treat rectal prolapse?

13:08:00&nbsp;
kristina
Appropriate protein levels in the tissues, as determined by phosporus in the HTMA, are important to rebuild and regenerate the body. 

13:08:02&nbsp;
Deb S
I'm not a doctor but there are other signs of thyroid problems also 

13:08:26&nbsp;
Deb S
perhaps I should come in for a visit Kristina

13:08:35&nbsp;
Deb S
hi Dave

13:08:37&nbsp;
kristina
Imbalanced levels of hormones can thin the hair. 

13:08:48&nbsp;
Dave
Hi all

13:08:51&nbsp;
TaraM
hi

13:08:54&nbsp;
Mike
hi

13:09:07&nbsp;
TaraM
Well Kristina, my hair is only thin on one side, and I don't sleep on that side anymore

13:09:26&nbsp;
TaraM
it is thin around the front edge of the left side of my head

13:09:30&nbsp;
Deb S
do you suggest saliva or blood work for hormones?

13:09:38&nbsp;
kristina
If your hair is thinning, we can correct that. We have lots of success with that issue.

13:09:38&nbsp;
TaraM
and it seems to be getting thinner by the week

13:09:50&nbsp;
kristina
Rectal prolapse

13:10:04&nbsp;
TaraM
I bought some hormone tests, I just need to do the saliva tests and turn them into the lab

13:10:13&nbsp;
michael b
the feedback on the newest flu shots was great in the oct. newsletter.

13:10:25&nbsp;
Mike
tara, have you always had thin hair?

13:10:34&nbsp;
TaraM
No Mike, I hadn't

13:10:43&nbsp;
kristina
Do you have full-thickness rectal prolapse where the entire rectum protrudes through the anus?

13:10:44&nbsp;
TaraM
my hair started thinning once I got anemic

13:11:05&nbsp;
Mike
if you don't mind me asking , how old are you?

13:11:16&nbsp;
TaraM
and then I had a hysterectomy and then it seems like that threw my hormones out of whack

13:11:18&nbsp;
TaraM
38

13:11:20&nbsp;
kristina
or do you have mucosal prolapse where only the rectal mucosa (not the entire wall) prolapses?

13:11:31&nbsp;
Mike
wow, that's young to have these issues

13:11:43&nbsp;
Deb S
the same thing happened to me after my hysterectomy Tara

13:11:45&nbsp;
TaraM
that because I am post-menopausal now

13:12:16&nbsp;
TaraM
now don't get me wrong, Deb and Mikeif you looked at my head you would think it is in my imagination that my hair is thinning

13:12:23&nbsp;
TaraM
:D 

13:12:34&nbsp;
TaraM
but I know what it USED to look like

13:12:42&nbsp;
Mike
aha, just like my wife

13:12:47&nbsp;
TaraM
I still have a head full of hair

13:12:50&nbsp;
Deb S
I just had mine done that way. Also my HGH was checked because my skin is very loose and the test was over the chart

13:12:59&nbsp;
TaraM
but it is nowhere close to as full as it was before my hysterectomy

13:13:37&nbsp;
TaraM
but it is very real that my hair is thinning at the front edge on my left side

13:13:42&nbsp;
TaraM
but I can easily hide it right now

13:14:03&nbsp;
TaraM
but I feel self conscious when I pull it all the way back in a ponytail

13:14:12&nbsp;
kristina
Saliva because saliva shows the hormone levels available to the cells on a day-to-day basis. Blood shows the bound forms of the hormone. the body also keeps the blood homeostatic, meaning that levels of hormones are maintained and only fluctuate when hormone levels are VERY imbalanced. You will find hormone imbalances in the saliva before you find them in the blood, in other words.

13:14:33&nbsp;
TaraM
ok kristina, good to know

13:14:41&nbsp;
Mike
kristina, it seems that enemas have fallen out of favor...they used to be very common and a bag was always hanging in everyone's bathroom. Now, you almost cannot find equipment in a pharmacy....Why?

13:14:54&nbsp;
Deb S
Kristina, I get hot flashes when I get stressed. Even when I don't know I am stressed

13:14:56&nbsp;
kristina
thank you, Michael. I worked hard on that.

13:16:32&nbsp;
Deb S
What would be the best type of appointment for my fatigue, skin tone, and colon care?

13:16:43&nbsp;
Marcy
 It must be mucosal prolapse because there is only a small amount is protruding. Kristina, do you have any products that could with this problem?

13:17:18&nbsp;
Mike
I used super salve that i found in health food store

13:17:27&nbsp;
TaraM
kristina, what hormones do I need to test for to see if they are out of balance and could be affecting my hair thinning?

13:17:29&nbsp;
Mike
worked great

13:17:42&nbsp;
kristina
Tara, look into our Female Hormone Panels. We do offer them but they are not currently viewable on our website. Here is some more information:

13:17:45&nbsp;
kristina
The Female Hormone Panel (FHP)&trade; is a simple, non-invasive test. Eleven saliva samples are collected during specified time periods throughout a menstrual cycle.  For the first time in routine medical practice, the FHP will allow both patient and doctor to view the profile of Estrogen and Progesterone (See Figure 1). In addition, we report the cycle average for Testosterone and DHEA. Diagnostic guesswork is minimized, and hormonal balance evaluation and customized treatment become a reality with the FHP.   The expanded FHP™ (eFHPTM) also includes 5 follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) measurements to see if both brain control and stimulation of the ovaries is optimal.   Applications of the Female Hormone Panel  The FHP can be used to detect and monitor the following:  • Functional infertility • Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) • Fibroids

13:17:54&nbsp;
kristina
• Influence of lifestyle (diet, exercise, etc.) on the hormone cycle  • Menstrual problems originating in the brain’s systems  • Early pregnancy problems - spontaneous miscarriage  • Cycle irregularities following the use of birth control pills  • Dysmenorrhea, i.e. painful and heavy periods • Migraine headaches  • Endometriosis and cystic ovarian disease • Early Osteoporosis  Advantages of the FHP™ 

13:18:04&nbsp;
kristina
1. Convenience: requires no blood draws, therefore no repeated clinic visits, and avoids the inconvenience of the 24-hour urine collection.   2. Customized Hormone Therapy Presently, female hormone therapy is not individualized to the needs of each woman because current diagnostic tests do not provide sufficient data. Consequently, most women are treated without regard to their individualized physiology and specific needs. The FHP, for the first time, will allow a clinician to customize therapy to each woman.

13:18:14&nbsp;
kristina
3. As is typical in most clinics, one or two blood samples or a 24-hour analysis of urine for these hormones cannot give an idea of the ovaries' hormonal productivity. The FHP gives a good approximation of the ovaries’ capacity over a whole cycle. 

13:18:40&nbsp;
TaraM
cool... is there a button on here to email this chat conversation or do I need to copy and paste?

13:18:54&nbsp;
kristina
We can get you cycling again, which at your age you want in order to optimize your health.

13:19:07&nbsp;
TaraM
yes I do

13:19:20&nbsp;
kristina
My screen just advanced so I lost the previous threads. Can you repost what I have missed?

13:19:59&nbsp;
kristina
The live chat will be posted on the website by tomorrow. You can also call us and we can talk with you and we have a brochure we can send out.

13:20:21&nbsp;
Deb S
What type of appointment would I need with you to help with my fatique, constipation, pain, etc?

13:20:26&nbsp;
kristina
the company we use to test the hormones is Diagnos-Techs 

13:20:52&nbsp;
kristina
also, listen to the lecture on www.drjlang.com

13:21:32&nbsp;
kristina
The lecture by Dr. Janet Lang will help you to see what we do and to deepen your understanding of how to improve your hormone health. 

13:21:44&nbsp;
kristina
Sorry that you have had all these troubles. Sounds hard.

13:22:47&nbsp;
kristina
Deb, do you live close to the clinic?

13:22:58&nbsp;
Deb S
near Oconomowoc

13:23:23&nbsp;
michael b
kristina, adding beets, red and gold, and carrots to help another benzene bather, to the juice of celery and cilantro is a real plus.

13:23:34&nbsp;
kristina
We could start with an appointment for colon hydrotherapy, if you wish. 

13:23:45&nbsp;
Mike
Is there anything that you can recommend for ED and enlarged prostate?...no cancer, been tested by urologist...nothing seems to help the ED

13:24:16&nbsp;
kristina
Or, you could do a HTMA and/or saliva test. Both are the most useful to address your individual health, but we can start with one or the other.

13:24:18&nbsp;
Deb S
I could do that. Would someone be able to answer questions?

13:24:36&nbsp;
kristina
Given the fatigue, I would recommend that if you choose one you choose the Adrenal Stress Index test.

13:24:54&nbsp;
Deb S
What does the test involve?

13:24:58&nbsp;
Marcy
Again, there is only a small amount protruding so I believe it is mucosal.

13:24:58&nbsp;
kristina
Tastes better or find it to be a better detox drink or both?

13:25:39&nbsp;
kristina
Mike, the Male Hormone Panel   that we test: Using a saliva sample, the regular Male Hormone Panel (MHP&trade;) panel measures six hormones: DHEA, Androstenedione, Testosterone, Dihy-drotestosterone, Estrone, and Progesterone. The extended MH panel measures these six hormones plus FSH and LH.   Traditionally, age-related male hormone changes were not considered problematic, because fertility in men persists until an advanced age.  Recent studies and careful evaluation in men has shown progressive changes, including: 

13:25:48&nbsp;
kristina
Decreased muscle mass and strength; Decreased vigor and low energy; Decreased libido; Insomnia; Nervousness and Depression; Hair Loss  

13:26:01&nbsp;
kristina
Diagnos-Techs' Male Hormone Panel provides valuable insight for physicians and their patients. Hormone imbalances and deficiencies can be discovered and treated, restoring a man’s life to a healthy state.

13:26:08&nbsp;
kristina
Again, call us up.

13:26:40&nbsp;
kristina
Also, if folks want to continue these conversations, we will just talk with you on the phone and we have an active Facebook page at Madison OHC

13:27:10&nbsp;
Deb S
Is colonics and hydrotherapy the same?

13:27:13&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, Deb, both DeeDee and I work with clients and we are both fully trained on these issues.

13:27:25&nbsp;
Mike
i see my urologist again next week (also having a complete physical this week) - if things do not improve, I will call you

13:27:28&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, colonics and hydrotherapy are the same thing, colon hydrotherapy.

13:27:35&nbsp;
kristina
Great, Mike!

13:27:45&nbsp;
kristina
I certainly would love the opportunity to work with you.

13:27:52&nbsp;
kristina
You are a young man!

13:28:04&nbsp;
Mike
thanks

13:28:25&nbsp;
Deb S
How can hemorrhoids be dealt with? Ouch!

13:28:35&nbsp;
Mike
are colonics and enemas equally as good for you?

13:28:58&nbsp;
kristina
okay, so the prolaspse is mucosal

13:29:18&nbsp;
kristina
How far out is it protruding?

13:29:47&nbsp;
kristina
With hemorrhoids, start with Super Salve

13:30:07&nbsp;
kristina
You will also need to make sure that you have a fully formed but soft bowel movement each day.

13:30:31&nbsp;
Deb S
That NEVER happens for me

13:30:49&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, colonics and enemas can offer the same therapeutic value, as long as the person giving the treatment knows how to clear out the entire colon

13:30:56&nbsp;
Marcy
Kristina, I have had problems with constipation for most of my life, but now that I have this prolapse I don't have that problem any more. The prolapse bothers me though. It is protruding about an inch, but only when I have a BM.

13:31:36&nbsp;
kristina
to learn more about colonics or colon hydrotherapy, go here on our website

13:34:05&nbsp;
kristina
okay, so we need to work on your bowel movements so they don't push the rectal area of your colon out of the anus.

13:34:26&nbsp;
kristina
Super salve is also an excellent place for you to start with the prolapse.

13:34:36&nbsp;
kristina
Put it on the anus when it is not protruding.

13:34:47&nbsp;
kristina
do you take enemas?

13:34:54&nbsp;
kristina
do they cause the prolapse at all?

13:35:25&nbsp;
kristina
Have I missed anything?

13:36:41&nbsp;
Marcy
Yes I do take enemas. I had a coffee enema not long ago.

13:37:27&nbsp;
kristina
More on optimizing hormonal health:

13:37:44&nbsp;
kristina
and how we approach it:

13:37:49&nbsp;
kristina
Wellness is the natural state. The human body is a powerful self-healing system that is designed to be well, to regenerate, and to thrive. Unfortunately, the past model of health care contradicts this truth. Illness and disease are misrepresented as the natural state and as the inevitable result of aging, rather than as the reflection of imbalance and a hindered regenerative process. The result of this disease management system has been catastrophic to the health of our general population. Generations are disconnected from their innate healing potential and believe they must survive in disease.

13:37:52&nbsp;
Marcy
I do not think that the enema caused it.

13:38:32&nbsp;
kristina
we use testing methods to establish the individualized hormonal and metabolic pattern of a patient. One can then identify the most appropriate, effective, and least invasive method for restoring and sustaining endocrine balance. Provided with the proper physical and lifestyle support a person will respond rapidly, and normal endocrine function can return.

13:38:34&nbsp;
Deb S
Okay, if it is natural and I don't want to live like this in my age, what can be done?

13:39:00&nbsp;
kristina
Primary testing methods include saliva testing and hair analysis, in addition to evaluating symptoms and lifestyle patterns. Protocols include lifestyle management, whole food nutritional supplements, high quality herbal supplements, and only when necessary, bioidentical hormone assistance therapy.

13:39:13&nbsp;
kristina
No, I don't necessarily think that the enemas caused it.

13:39:18&nbsp;
michael b
mike, i think prostate gland removal was a real cash cow in the 1990s. i think that closer watching, rather than instant surgery, is more common now.

13:39:43&nbsp;
Deb S
Why not bio-identical hormones?

13:39:44&nbsp;
kristina
What I am wondering is does the prolapse occur after you release the enema solution and waste or just when you move your bowels on  your own?

13:39:55&nbsp;
Mike
Kristina, they have no reason to remove mine...Its just BPH

13:40:50&nbsp;
kristina
Call us up, order the appropriate Hormone tests and we will recommend certain lifestyle management changes, whole food nutritional supplements, high quality herbal supplements, and when necessary, bioidentical hormone assistance therapy.

13:41:01&nbsp;
Mike
Just got a phone call...I have ro go, I'll read transcript if you have anything else to add..Thanks Kristina

13:41:06&nbsp;
Marcy
Just when I have a BM, and it seems to prevent a total elimination.

13:41:07&nbsp;
Mike
bye everyone

13:41:11&nbsp;
TaraM
kristina, could there be some internal medicinal reason why only the left side of my head is thinning if I sleep on my back and don't favor any side to sleep on?

13:41:17&nbsp;
TaraM
bye mike

13:42:14&nbsp;
kristina
Hormones are very powerful activators to all of the cells.

13:42:39&nbsp;
kristina
Hormones are treated as if they are supplements, which they absolutely are not.

13:42:59&nbsp;
kristina
Also, no one hormone is ever the problem or the solution.

13:43:11&nbsp;
kristina
Each and every hormone acts within a family of hormones.

13:43:14&nbsp;
Deb S
Unfortunately I have been on them for about 4 years when I thought I was gonna never get out of bed again. I was tested and my levels were none.

13:43:40&nbsp;
kristina
It is essential to address the whole family of hormones and then keep monitoring the body 

13:43:51&nbsp;
Dave
Once men reach a certain age (over 70), even if they develop prostate cancer it grows so slowly that something else will be the cause of death. Younger guys are a different story.

13:44:11&nbsp;
kristina
If not done properly, bio identical hormones can dysregulate the entire system

13:44:22&nbsp;
TaraM
Kristina, do herbal breast enhancement creams and pills really work?

13:44:49&nbsp;
kristina
More is not necessarily better in hormoneland. Just the opposite. Excess hormones in the system can and will shut down the endocrine system.

13:44:57&nbsp;
Deb S
I had improved but never had any energy. But I was like that before I was even 25

13:45:32&nbsp;
Deb S
What can I do now because I do get checked very regularly

13:45:49&nbsp;
kristina
Might you take daily enemas while you work on your gut health with us?

13:46:08&nbsp;
Deb S
who is that for

13:46:42&nbsp;
kristina
We never use hormone creams because it is impossible to dose them well. The cream gets on family members, pets, and other places it doesn't belong.

13:47:56&nbsp;
kristina
In my mind, a 70 year old man is young and needs to also work on the hormonal and toxic issues that caused the cancer in order to optimize his health

13:48:20&nbsp;
kristina
I am glad that you had those tools then. This is good. 

13:48:41&nbsp;
kristina
more on saliva tests:

13:48:58&nbsp;
kristina
Saliva tests for the &quot;free&quot; physiologically active form of the hormone.

13:49:26&nbsp;
Dave
Agreed, best to prevent in the first place.

13:49:50&nbsp;
kristina
Marcy

13:49:53&nbsp;
Deb S
so that kit is different than the one I used to see the levels in the first place (4 tube kit)

13:50:23&nbsp;
kristina
Deb, who did you test with? We do use multiple samples

13:50:36&nbsp;
Marcy
  Yes, I will do that, but I need some good ingredients for this purpose.

13:50:47&nbsp;
Deb S
ZRT

13:51:28&nbsp;
Marcy
What do you suggest?

13:52:40&nbsp;
kristina
Optimize your diet, use herbs and whole food supplements to rebuild the gut mucosa, use the appropriate probiotics. Might you start with us with a HTMA?

13:52:41&nbsp;
harolds
All of our needs are different, and I am not a doctor, but for me enemas have been a lifetime benefit. My mom was a nurse, and I grew up in the era when most homes had an enema bag hanging on the back of the bathroom door, and enemas help provide good health

13:52:51&nbsp;
kristina
HTMA

13:53:11&nbsp;
kristina
diet

13:53:57&nbsp;
kristina
Ortho Mucosagen would be an example of one of the products we might use with you once we got to know you better

13:54:42&nbsp;
Deb S
Is grapefruit extract beneficial for using in the water for an enema?

13:54:56&nbsp;
kristina
Deb, the testing would be similar and if you have current results, within the last 3 months, we can work with the data on the ZRT test but we have chosen to go with the lab Diagnos-Techs

13:55:18&nbsp;
kristina
Diagnos-Techs

13:55:49&nbsp;
Deb S
I can call and make an appointment if needed to see what I should do unless the website you just posted is for me

13:56:27&nbsp;
kristina
Hormone creams and gels build up in subcutaneous tissue and after several months or longer, depending on the fat cell content of the person will release excessive amounts of free, unbound hormone into the system.

13:56:52&nbsp;
kristina
the use of hormone creams and gels leads to progressive overdosing, triggering a host of increasing problems.

13:57:19&nbsp;
Deb S
Yikes! So hopw would we know this? By a certain test that you just spoke of or what?

13:57:46&nbsp;
kristina
Oral pills will be deactivated or mostly bound by the liver. This can both stress and overwork the liver over time.

13:58:38&nbsp;
Marcy
Thank you so much. You have been very helpful. I will be in touch! Bye for now!

13:58:50&nbsp;
kristina
Also, various nutrients or vitamins, minerals and phytonutrients are required to make hormones by the body.

13:59:02&nbsp;
michael b
Dave, as you well know, us folks can do a lot to maintain better health, kinda why we are at this chat.

13:59:11&nbsp;
kristina
As well as to stimulate its release and facilitate its entry into cells.

13:59:38&nbsp;
kristina
In other words, each hormone is completely dependent on a team of nutrients in order to function.

13:59:39&nbsp;
Deb S
Can I ever have good hormones at my age without medication?

14:00:46&nbsp;
kristina
Thus the beauty of the HTMA. This will show us, to some degree, what nutrients are needed supplementally to optimize hormonal health.

14:01:29&nbsp;
kristina
Wow! This has been a fabulous chat. I must go. Sorry if I missed anyone's questions or comments. I look forward to more interaction over the phone, in person, on the next live chat and on Facebook!

14:01:46&nbsp;
harolds
