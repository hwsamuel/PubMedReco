Welcome Drew &amp; Tiffany

Tiffany B
Hi DeeDee, this is actually Brooke P. (My first name is Tiffany, but I've always gone by Brooke.)

13:01:56
DeeDee
Any topics or questions anyone has today?

13:01:59
Drew G
Hi

13:02:09
DeeDee
Hi Brooke, I thought that may be you.

13:02:26
Tiffany B
I would like to discuss healing the thyroid and also estrogen dominance

13:02:41
Tiffany B
or excess estrogen.

13:03:17
DeeDee
Have we done the female hormone testing on you, or have you had it done? I can't remember.

13:03:57
Tiffany B
No, I have not done it with you... Ii did have it tested when I first started going holistic, but it was 4 years ago.

13:04:24
DeeDee
What symptoms are you having that leads you to the estrogen dominance?

13:04:55
Drew G
I was looking through the website and see where it is stated that there is an enema set up sold on the site that is compared favorably to getting a colonic. Is is possible for an enema to be as cleansing as a colonic?

13:06:14
Moron4392
I am new at this sort of a thing - please bear with me. What product would be good for the first time? Plus heard they help with depression - could you explain this to me?    

13:06:15
DeeDee
Yes, enemas can be very much like a colonic when done with enough water and in a series.  The Flowmaster system on the site is a great one to use to accomplish that.

13:06:22
DeeDee
I have clients who have done colonics right after an enema series here and there is nothing left to come out.

13:06:46
Tiffany B
Well, I suppose low libido... The reason I ask is because Ii actually went to the Weston Price conference 2 weekends ago and Sally Fallon's husband was there doing energy work. (He's an energy healer.)... Anyhow, he said that I had excess estrogen from soy foods.

13:07:09
Tiffany B
I know this isn't &quot;scientific&quot; but I thought it was interesting.

13:07:39
DeeDee
Welcome, Moron. Our Easy Enema systems on the website are good starter kits.  They are latex, so if you have an allergy to latex, you'd want to go with stainless steel, vinyl or silicone, which would be different systems.

13:08:17
Moron4392
Mame: Just want to thank you for your assistance - it is greatly appreciated.

13:08:48
Drew G
Does the flowmaster system come with the metal standing pole it is pictured with?

13:09:07
DeeDee
Brooke, that is probably correct.  Soy acts like an estrogen in the body and can definitely lead to an imbalance of hormones.  We would need to make sure the digestive system and liver were working well first. (The liver helps to remove the excess hormones in the body.)

13:09:23
Moron4392
Mame:  In closing just want to state may you and your family have a great and blessed Thanksgiving.

13:10:17
DeeDee
We would make sure your diet is good (which I think it is, in speaking with you regarding this before) and make sure digestion and elimination are good.  

13:10:21
Tiffany B
That makes sense...I haven't eaten soy in years (except small amounts of fermented soy)  but he said he could &quot;feel&quot; that the effects were still in my system

13:10:25
DeeDee
Doing a liver cleanse/support would be important and supporting the adrenals, which would then in turn help the thyroid.

13:10:49
DeeDee
Happy Thanksgiving to you also, Moron.

13:11:04
Tiffany B
The body is definitely interconnected :)

13:11:47
Drew G
What do you recommend as a &quot;standard&quot; liquid for an enema? What type of water and what if anything in the water?

13:11:55
DeeDee
Drew, none of our systems comes with the IV stand shown, but we do offer it as a separate item to purchase on our website.

13:13:26
DeeDee
Drew, when we do a series of enemas here, the first one is usually soap (such as Dr. Bronner's castile lavender soap) or something similar.  Then we do a second one with Celtic Sea Salt and some essential oils such as peppermint.

13:13:41
DeeDee
Third we may do a coffee implant, probiotics, or healing essential oils.

13:13:59
Tiffany B
When we do the results from my hair analysis, we could discuss in more depth. Also do you think there are any tests that I should do prior to that discussion to give a more clear picture of what is going on?

13:14:21
DeeDee
The water for enemas should always be filtered, RO or distilled is fine if you add sea salt to it.

13:14:49
Drew G
Thanks for your answers. Have a good day.

13:15:07
DeeDee
Brooke, your results just came in today, so we should set up a time for next week.  E-mail me after the chat and let me know what works well for you.

13:15:21
Tiffany B
Yay!

13:15:23
Tiffany B
Will do.

13:15:58
DeeDee
We can start out looking at this test first, but we may want to look at another test eventually. 

13:16:25
Tiffany B
That sounds good...I do have an adrenal test that was done in May.

13:17:20
DeeDee
We can look at that also, because it is not that old.  Do you use Young Living Essential oils at all?

13:18:07
Tiffany B
I do - I use Endo-Flex some.

13:18:28
Tiffany B
At the conference, they had an electro/energy test that I did to tell you what you need.

13:18:32
DeeDee
I know you have had troubles with digestion in the past and the oils bypass digestion and we can get faster results at times because of this.

13:18:58
DeeDee
That's great!  Did it give you any other feedback?

13:19:03
Tiffany B
Yes, I do still have problems with digestion...

13:19:12
Tiffany B
Yep, Ii have the whole printout that was emailed to me.

13:19:49
Tiffany B
I am definitely getting better and have made some major improvements, but I'm still not where I want to be and I know that takes time.

13:19:57
DeeDee
We use trigger points for testing whether an oil is good for you or not.  This can be done easily by you at home also.  It should be done frequently because it can change from day to day or week to week.

13:20:22
DeeDee
That printout would be great to look at also.

13:20:31
Tiffany B
OK, I'll email it to you.

13:21:10
DeeDee
Great!   Anything else you want to discuss now?  We are the only two left.  Everyone is probably busy with travel or holiday stuff.

13:21:24
Tiffany B
I have been doing coffee enemas too... When I do them I can feel my liver and gallbladder cleaning out,  BIG TIME!

13:21:46
DeeDee
Coffee enemas are great, aren't they?  I love them.

13:22:13
Tiffany B
It feels so freshing and cleansing...I just have to be careful because I think my adrenals still can't handle me doing them every day.

13:22:51
DeeDee
Right, and helping your liver like that will also help with the excess hormones.

13:23:00
Tiffany B
Yep, that's what I figured.

13:23:20
Tiffany B
I do have a question: what do you think of food allergy tests (IGg90)?

13:23:40
Tiffany B
If they say that you have an immune reaction to milk.....do you think you should still do raw dairy?

13:25:02
DeeDee
Food allergy testing can be very helpful.  I know of people that were kind of stuck in the recovery and once they did a food allergy test and removed some items that they were eating regularly, they started getting better.

13:25:58
DeeDee
Raw dairy is much better because our bodies do process it much better, but if it shows up as an allergy, you may want to remove it all together.  That is what Kristina did.

13:26:16
Tiffany B
Did she remove it permanently?

13:26:20
Tiffany B
Even raw butter?

13:26:36
DeeDee
Yes, she has not gone back to it and it has been probably over a year by now.

13:26:54
DeeDee
She also removed eggs.  She already had gluten and soy removed.

13:27:08
Tiffany B
Does she eat any animal fat?

13:27:36
DeeDee
Yes, she still eats beef, bison, sardines, oysters.

13:28:10
Tiffany B
Gotchya...because I had a food allergy test done and I had a strong reaction to dairy...but I just feel like I get SOOOOO many good nutrients from it.

13:28:46
DeeDee
I know what you mean, but it may be hindering your recovery.

13:29:04
Tiffany B
Yeah, I can see that.

13:29:16
Tiffany B
I haven't been drinking raw milk, just raw cheese and butter.

13:29:34
Tiffany B
Oh well, we can discuss this too next week.

13:29:46
Tiffany B
Sometimes, things seem like a catch-22 in healing.

13:30:16
DeeDee
I know, you never know until you break it all down and go step by step.

13:30:20
Tiffany B
You need those raw good materials to heal, yet your body can't digest them well or it causes a reaction of some sort.

13:31:19
DeeDee
Right.

13:31:19
Tiffany B
I completely agree with breaking it down.. That's what I would really like to do with you next week...

13:31:23
Tiffany B
I'm out of the flight or fight mode because I've been off from work for a couple weeks and will be until Feb and I feel like I have A LOT of the pieces of the puzzle now.

13:31:58
DeeDee
That is great, I can't wait to hear of your progress and revelations!

13:35:22
Tiffany B
Yeah, I'm excited! Have a great Thanksgiving!

13:37:11
DeeDee
Bye and thanks!

13:43:23
Scott M
I'm a bit slow today...everyone must be getting a jump on the holiday.

13:43:32
DeeDee
Hi Scott, do you have anything you want to ask?

13:43:48
DeeDee
I think everyone else is traveling or getting ready for the holiday.

13:46:11
Scott M
First of all... I want to thank you for your efforts and resolving a prior issue on an order. I don't often get time to check on the live chat, although I view the archives.

13:46:31
DeeDee
Hi, Michael.

13:47:00
DeeDee
Thank you, Scott.  I am glad I could help.

13:48:18
michael b.
A most wonderful Thanksgiving to all chatters here today.

13:49:08
DeeDee
I am having great results with some of the essential oils in the enemas and applied topically.  The other day I had a very anxious stomach which cause me indigestion and a very bloated stomach, not to mention pain. I applied about 3 drops of each fennel and peppermint oils with a little coconut oil and went to see a client.  In about 10 - 15 minutes, the bloating was down and the pain was gone!  I was amazed.  Usually those stomach aches and bloating last a whole day!

13:49:55
Scott M
I have been using very common solutions for my enema cleansing regimen in the past. Recently, a clerk at a local health food store suggested using chlorophyll on occasion. Is this very common and are there any contraindications?

13:50:04
DeeDee
Chlorophyll is very useful and binds the toxins for easy removal.

13:51:19
DeeDee
This is very beneficial especially when doing coffee enemas.

13:52:00
DeeDee
Happy Thanksgiving to you also Michael.  Have you received your implant stuff yet?

13:52:57
Scott M
Would you suggest larger volume enemas with the chlorophyll or a smaller volume with longer retention?

13:55:23
DeeDee
You want to do 1-2 higher volume cleansing enemas first.  Then you implant smaller amounts of the chlorophyll (a couple of ounces) and retain for as long as your body lets you.   You can also take chlorophyll perles  orally before enemas.

13:58:14
michael b.
DeeDee, how much is a little coconut oil? Also, thanks for sending the implant stuff, although nothing has arrived yet.

13:59:55
DeeDee
Coconut oil for massaging the essential oils in?  Just a little scoop on my hand.

13:59:59
Scott M
Thanks for the information! I had the privilege of being in the clinic about 6 years ago. I suppose than I can only hope that somebody will undertake a similar endeavor here in the mountain west. Have a nice holiday.

14:01:06
DeeDee
Thank you Scott. Have a great Thanksgiving. 

14:10:00
michael b.
A great turkey day for you and your family.

14:10:33
michael b.
Bye now.

14:10:37
DeeDee
Bye.
