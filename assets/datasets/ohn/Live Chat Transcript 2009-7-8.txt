Sorry that I got the date wrong on this live chat. I am glad that you all figured out that it was the 8th and not the 11th.

20:05:06&nbsp;
kristina
If anyone has any questions, comments or concerns, please do let me know.

20:05:21&nbsp;
kristina
I have a few topics that I would like to advance tonight.

20:05:54&nbsp;
kristina
The first topic is the colonoscopy, preparation for the colonoscopy, and the colonoscopy prodecure.

20:06:27&nbsp;
kristina
I also want to announce here that we will soon have some long-desired new enema equipment products to offer. 

20:07:15&nbsp;

Hi Kristina, my first time here -- I have a question...

20:08:09&nbsp;
Lisa P.
I read something scary about the colonoscopy prep, that it can harm your kidneys. Do you know anything about this?

20:08:20&nbsp;
michael b
kristina, that's why we are here. you seem to have an overly live brain.

20:08:24&nbsp;
kristina
Finally, I will announce that I am considering starting a program where I would travel to offer a sort of Colon Therapist in Residence program. The first area I would like to visit is the Los Angeles area. I would spend a week at each location. I might visit as many as 5-6 different locations each year.

20:08:55&nbsp;
kristina
Welcome, Amanda. I am pleased that you came to the live chat tonight.

20:09:17&nbsp;
Dave
Maybe enema frequency. Seems to me seeing on internet and talking to some people, including my local colon therapist who self-gives, that weekly is quite popular.

20:09:28&nbsp;
kristina
Do you have a link to this information about colonoscopy prep, Lisa? Or a source title or article that we might reference?

20:10:30&nbsp;
kristina
Aw, Michael, you flatter me. I simply love this work that I do and just today I was telling my staff that it is sometimes a challenge to manage the creative flow that comes forth from myself and my clients and customers.

20:10:59&nbsp;
Lisa P.
I know nothing about this. I heard this from my mom and I don't know where she got her information, but she watches cable news a lot. I'll do some research.

20:11:41&nbsp;
Dave
BTW, BillsE from the old board sends greetings to those who remember him.

20:12:06&nbsp;
Karen L
hello

20:12:10&nbsp;
kristina
A weekly enema schedule seems to promote excellent health for many people. 

20:12:49&nbsp;
razor
good evening from Masssachusetts

20:13:19&nbsp;
kristina
Thanks, Lisa.

20:13:30&nbsp;
kristina
Here is one article: Danger to Kidneys May Lurk in Some Preparations for Colonoscopies. Here is the first paragraph of the article to put it into context: &quot;No one disputes that colonoscopies save lives. But recent research has prompted concern that in rare instances certain popular bowel-cleansing preparations that patients gulp down the day before a procedure can severely damage the kidneys.&quot; 

20:13:37&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Good evening from very, very hot Texas!!

20:13:41&nbsp;
Dave
Thanks. Would seem a reasonable schedule, especially for those who don't have colonics. 

20:15:41&nbsp;
Lisa P.
So this can be true then.

20:15:42&nbsp;
razor
I have only done the scope once and it's not on my list to do again -- used saline laxative to drink to clear system

20:16:00&nbsp;
kristina
I have worked with many people who experienced weeks of intestinal upset after the colonoscopy. I am confident that this intestinal upset comes from the preparatory fluids that are used.

20:16:48&nbsp;
kristina
You can prepare for a colonoscopy using at-home enemas and/or colon hydrotherapy without the ill effects of the preparatory fluids to clear out the entire colon.

20:16:48&nbsp;
Dave
Think one ingredient of the vile prep drink is glycol, a relative of anti-freeze but not the same.

20:17:23&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Too bad doctors won't suggest that!

20:17:48&nbsp;
kristina
I have assisted many people now over these past 9 years to do this and they always report back to me that the doctor has been able to go ahead with the colonoscopy and that the colon is cleared out fully.

20:18:00&nbsp;
kristina
hello, Karen!

20:18:07&nbsp;
kristina
Hello, Razor!

20:19:00&nbsp;
kristina
If anyone needs any support to clear the colon before a colonoscopy, let us know. We can walk you through the process to have a successful colonoscopy.

20:19:18&nbsp;
razor
hello, doctor said the saline laxative beat the previous chemical mix.  Bottle said it was just distilled water and sodium chloride contents concentrated.

20:19:21&nbsp;
michael b
having had a colonoscopy, having golightly prescribed as the prep the day before, small amounts over a period of time, was sedated, i was then told all was fine.  

20:21:14&nbsp;
razor
Would you suggest telling the doctor you're going to do an alternate cleanse or just show up and go for it?

20:21:37&nbsp;
amanda b
Does one need to do a colonoscopy even if you are doing enemas?

20:22:29&nbsp;
Dave
Lisa, somewhere on YouTube is a news show clip of a Danbury, CT, doc saying colonics alone are fine. Not the prevailing view out there for sure.

20:22:43&nbsp;
kristina
Also, I recommend that you consider not being sedated. The actual scoping is a lot like havinig a colon hydrotherapy session. And, you can then see your own colon while the doctor is viewing it. 

20:22:49&nbsp;
razor
The colonoscopy is to look for cancer and or polyps that might be trouble

20:23:23&nbsp;
kristina
Also, the current anesthesia that is being used can actually wipe out small parts of your memory.

20:24:17&nbsp;
razor
good, I'll tell my wife that's why I forget things

20:24:32&nbsp;
Dave
There are different levels of sedation. i did very lightly and saw the picture show on the monitor, LOL.

20:25:34&nbsp;
razor
Doctor wants to do one on me every 2-3 years but I am not on board with that.

20:26:04&nbsp;
kristina
New enema equipment products that the Optimal Health Network will be offering over the next period:

20:26:15&nbsp;
kristina
Amanda, did I miss your question?

20:26:28&nbsp;
Dave
You high-risk, razor? Seems excessive otherwise.

20:26:46&nbsp;
kristina
A stainless steel enema bucket with a hanging handle and a low spout to fully drain the bucket that will hold one gallon of water

20:27:19&nbsp;
kristina
A stainless steel enema bucket with a hanging handle and a low spout to fully drain the bucket that will only hold one quart for colon implants.

20:27:34&nbsp;
razor
no, he found 2 small polyps. just think it's how he makes the money

20:27:34&nbsp;
kristina
 A black silicone 4 quart or one gallon enema bag.

20:28:55&nbsp;
michael b
kristina, this was over 5 years ago that i had the colonoscopy. i did ask if i had  any parasites. the doctor said no, so i was happy, but had to have someone take me home. 

20:29:17&nbsp;
amanda b
Kristina: thinking of ordering 2 liter bucket kit -- when is this new stainless steel bucket available?

20:30:56&nbsp;
kristina
End of August is when the new stainless steel enema buckets will be available as stand-alone items and as kits.

20:32:51&nbsp;
razor
the 4 quart silicone is great -- have the current clear model

20:34:05&nbsp;
razor
did you get the FIR back up and running?

20:34:12&nbsp;
amanda b
Kristina: is the bucket kit w/ silicone tube/retention nozzle for people who have problem retaining the coffee? I start w/ water but still only can retain coffee for 2-4 minutes...

20:35:37&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, our FIR sauna is working well. The heating element went out but Sunlight Sauna replaced it at no cost to us.

20:35:53&nbsp;
kristina
Also, we are having a special on our sauna packages right now.

How much coffee solution do you use?

2 quarts - sometimes a bit more - what's the correct amount?

20:38:08&nbsp;
kristina
How much time do you take to implant the coffee solution?

20:38:26&nbsp;

Do you clear out the colon before you take the coffee solution?

the FIR Sauna is a dry sauna -- is a wet sauna not as good?

20:40:20&nbsp;
kristina
Michael, it is a different sort of therapy for the body, which isn't to say it isn't good.

20:40:43&nbsp;
Dave
On coffee, how about a pint full strength and retained for 12-15 minutes? As good as a diluted bagful?

20:41:36&nbsp;
kristina
A far infrared ray is a form of electromagnetic light energy from the sun. It falls within the same family as infrared rays in the light spectrum, but due to its longer wavelengths, FIR cannot be seen by human eyes, just like ultraviolet rays and X-rays. This radiant energy is absolutely essential for human beings and all living things in the world.  

20:42:36&nbsp;
kristina
FIR light direct warms only the object and does not raise the temperature of the surrounding free air. This type of energy travels 2-3&quot; deep into the body and is thought by some to increase circulation and nourish damaged tissue... I have seen it clear up difficult cases of ezcema, assist people to lose weight who hadn't been able to, relieve people of arthritis and other inflammatory conditions like IBS and chronic headaches.

20:44:44&nbsp;
razor
I have enjoyed the FIR and prefer it to a wet sauna.  My muscles feel better, and it seems to heat stress the body less

20:45:33&nbsp;
kristina
Amanda, I would use less solution. You might find that one cup of coffee does the trick for you. It is key to the therapy of the coffee enema to hold the coffee solution for 12-15 minutes.

20:45:44&nbsp;
kristina
You don't need a lot of coffee.

20:46:00&nbsp;
kristina
Also, I would always start your coffee enema treatment with a cleansing enema or two. 

20:46:32&nbsp;
amanda b
You mean cleansing w/ water?

20:46:37&nbsp;
razor
I use 3 cups water and one cup of coffee typically

20:48:13&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, first, before you take the coffee enema. 

20:48:51&nbsp;
razor
I normally will do 2 or 3 enemas followed by the coffee round

20:49:29&nbsp;
kristina
How often should I take coffee enemas?

20:49:49&nbsp;
kristina
Why take a coffee enema

20:50:36&nbsp;
