Good day to all. Sorry I am a couple minutes late today. Had a seminar to learn more about gluten sensitivity.

13:04:51
Dave
Hello.

13:07:09
kristina
Hey all, I got bumped off but I am back. How is everyone?

13:07:15
jay t
Hi

13:07:22
AdrienneW
Great!  How r u?

13:08:06
kristina
I am very good. I learned a lot this morning and I am very happy when I have the privilege of learning more.

13:08:53
Dave
K. has your son confirmed on Davidson, which has a great reputation?

13:08:58
kristina
Want to make sure you all know that the Optimal Health Network's newsletter subscriber sale is going on right now. 

13:09:05
kristina
15% off all items we offer.

13:09:22
AdrienneW
Do we just begin by asking questions? 

13:09:35
AdrienneW
Not sure how this works.

13:09:36
kristina
Also, I wrote a useful article about tackling constipation in the April newsletter.

13:10:03
kristina
Yes, he is going to Davidson. Isn't that great? We worked very hard on the college search and it really paid off.

13:10:29
kristina
Yes, Adrienne, just share what is on your mind.

13:10:33
Dave
Students actually must study there, I've read, LOL.

13:10:55
kristina
It is very academically rigorous; I am a bit jealous.

13:11:03
kristina
I didn't have the luxury of such an adventure.

13:11:04
AdrienneW
About eating, raw-grass fed meat...does this include any cut, ground, etc.?

13:11:16
kristina
He is a lucky, hard-working, and focused young man.

13:11:25
kristina
Good question, Adrienne.

13:11:32
kristina
And not an easily question to answer.

13:11:40
kristina
There are many different opinions out there.

13:12:32
AdrienneW
You mention in your book that it was when you ate meat that you really began to heal. What kind of meat was it?

13:12:44
kristina
Certainly, many people will go to a sushi bar and not think twice about the quality of the fish they are eating, but when it comes to eating other meats raw, we are all so weary of it.

13:13:00
AdrienneW
True.

13:13:10
kristina
I ate lots of raw, grass-fed bison and beef.

13:13:35
AdrienneW
for every 4-6 meal per day?

13:13:39
kristina
I almost always get my bison meat from North Star Bison.

13:14:07
kristina
When I first started eating meat again, I would eat 1-3 pounds daily, most raw or rare.

13:14:13
AdrienneW
I do have the raw milk and raw eggs, and have noticed a marked improvement within one week. (IBS sufferer here too).

13:14:25
AdrienneW
OK.

13:14:26
kristina
I get my grass-fed beef from a local Amish farmer that I know personally.

13:14:42
AdrienneW
(you're so lucky)

13:15:01
kristina
However, over the years, I always by the grass-fed beef and buffalo that is being sold at Whole Foods and my local food coop, Willy St. Coop.

13:15:16
Dave
On sushi, my local colon therapist says she's seeing clients with parasites from sushi, presumably the low-quality kind.

13:15:19
kristina
This is great news, Adrienne.

13:15:31
kristina
What improvements have you experienced?

13:15:48
AdrienneW
Have people reported a reversal of adomenal restrictions on OHC or the Weston Diet?

13:16:19
AdrienneW
I have experienced increased regularity and less abdomenal tension -- almost immediately.

13:16:27
kristina
Yes, I know that it can be next to impossible to actually find a farmer one knows and trusts.

13:16:32
AdrienneW
But...I drink the milk VERY often.

13:16:41
rick i
please tell me advantages of coffee enemas

13:16:51
kristina
How much raw milk do you drink?

13:16:55
AdrienneW
And make milk and raw egg &quot;smoothies.&quot;

13:17:21
kristina
The raw egg and raw milk smoothies are excellent healing tools.

13:17:31
AdrienneW
approx. 0.5 to 1 cup milk 4 times per day.

13:17:33
kristina
What other symptoms are you still struggling with Adrienne?

13:17:39
AdrienneW
as a smoothie.

13:18:15
AdrienneW
still some tightness, but it has eased... just not gone.

13:18:49
AdrienneW
I am more alert as well... don't know what others have experienced... would love to hear how others are faring.

13:19:54
Rob D
Wow. Just received my order.

13:20:07
kristina
What did you order, Rob?

13:20:27
kristina
Seems like a good amount of raw milk. Any ill effect from the milk?

13:20:33
Rob D
4 qt. bag with colon tube.

13:20:44
kristina
Coffee enemas have many advantages.

13:20:50
AdrienneW
Not at all....

13:21:30
kristina
A coffee enema will aid the liver with detoxification.

13:21:55
kristina
Rob, where did the &quot;wow&quot; come from?

13:22:05
Rob D
Please provide tips for cleaning retention plugs.

13:22:28
Rob D
&quot;Wow&quot; was for the quick service.

13:23:12
rick i
i know that you have to use herbal or organic coffee - also what is the best equipment to use?

13:23:26
kristina
The coffee in the solution goes up the hemorrhoidal vein and reaches the liver directly. When the liver is stimulated, your body's detoxification process is enhanced.

13:24:06
kristina
Thanks. The woman, Lynette, who ships for me, works very hard to move the orders out quickly. I love her. She does so much for all of us.

13:25:03
kristina
To clear retention plugs, run very hot water through them and use small bottle cleaner or a pipe cleaner, if needed. I would also soak them in hot water and grapefruit seed extract.

13:25:42
donna j
Hi everyone, I'm a first time chatter and a colon therapist in fort worth tx.

13:25:49
kristina
And a personal hello to all who are here.

13:25:54
kristina
Hello Donna! 

13:25:55
AdrienneW
Hi Donna!

13:26:01
kristina
It is very good to have you here.

13:26:16
kristina
How is your colon hydrotherapy practice coming along? 

13:26:41
kristina
Feel free to tell as much as you wish about your practice!

13:27:05
Dave
Legal roadblocks in TX?

13:27:11
kristina
Yes, always use organic (and fairly traded) coffee for your coffee enema.

13:27:11
dman
anyone else here been using  edgar cayce's protocol for colon cleasing?

13:27:11
AdrienneW
(would love to know)

13:27:29
AdrienneW
Haven't read it, dman

13:27:44
kristina
You can tell us about the protocol, dman.

13:27:56
kristina
I have worked with it, but not in recent years.

13:28:02
kristina
Are you using castor oil packs?

13:28:05
dman
it's basically first wash with 1 part salt and 1 part baking soda

13:28:06
kristina
?

13:28:22
dman
then the final wash is with glyothymoline

13:28:33
AdrienneW
Have you had success with this, dman?  

13:28:34
dman
it's been very effective for me

13:28:46
AdrienneW
(u just answered my ?)

13:28:50
dman
yes, i've used castor oil packs too

13:29:06
AdrienneW
what is glyothymoline?

13:29:11
dman
castor oil packs have also cleansed my colon, but it only happened the first time is used it.

13:29:25
kristina
Using a stainless steel enema bucket with silicone tubing and a silicone colon tube is an excellent choice of enema equipment for taking a coffee enema.

13:29:44
dman
yes, i've had great success with it. I don't do any other combo anymore. just the cayce one.

13:29:51
AdrienneW
the olive oil, aloe, and MSM implant is really healing.

13:30:15
kristina
Can you tell us about your experience using the olive oil, aloe and MSM implant, Adrienne?

13:30:45
kristina
What kind of results are you seeing, dman, with the Edgar Cayce protocol?

13:31:10
rick i
thanks from rick i. any places in los angeles you would reccomend for colon cleansing?

13:31:11
dman
btw i placed the castor oil pack over my abdomen and not my liver area. i'm pretty sure the castor oil simply increased the blood flow to my colon and this was the reason why i ejected old colon matter.

13:32:07
dman
good results. the 1 tablespnoon glycothymoline / 1 quart of water had removed tons of mucus.

13:32:11
AdrienneW
Hmmmm...don't know how to put it delicately...but had very inflamed lower bowel to an IBS episode...I followed two enemas with the implant and the effects were virtually immediate.  I have not had to do it again.

13:32:29
kristina
Coffee stimulates the liver to make more bile. Bile, from the gallbladder draws out environmental and metabolic toxins, as well as the very irritating toxins from Candida albicans and other parasite-like organisms. The colon is the organ responsible for carrying away these toxins. In addition, coffee enemas stimulate the liver to produce enzymes that clean the blood. Coffee enemas also assist the colon to develop better function. In these ways, coffee enemas are an essential resource in a colon cleansing program.

13:32:44
donna j
I've been in practice since 1997 and I'm totally dedicated to colon hydrotherapy. Kristina, I've been following your website for years and hope to meet with you at the convention this year. I'm a fan! Thank you for all of your information.

13:32:59
AdrienneW
what is glycothymoline?

13:33:07
kristina
Excellent! Or, as my son says, &quot;Nice!&quot;

13:33:16
dman
it's like listerine, an antiseptic used for mouthwash.

13:33:41
AdrienneW
Oh...

13:34:37
kristina
This is the colon hydrotherapy clinic I recommend in the LA area.

13:35:21
dman
has anyone noticed that their legs have gotten straightened with colon cleansing?

13:35:22
kristina
I have to say that I didn't find the glycothymoline a healing enema solution.

13:35:32
kristina
Dman?

13:36:02
kristina
Thank you very much, Donna. 

13:36:09
kristina
I would be honored to meet you.

13:36:10
dman
 a healing one? well, from my experience it seems to remove mucus.

13:37:01
donna j
I'm wanting to introduce enemas to Texas.

13:37:04
AdrienneW
Do you mean u walk better because of the lack of impactions now?

13:37:04
kristina
 Currently, I have plans to be in Colorado at the same time the convention is happening, but I am thinking of changing my plans so that I can be at the International Association of Colon Hydrotherapist 2010 convention.

13:37:52
kristina
Enemas are a fabulous healing tool for people to have easy access to; I also find they enhance a colon hydrotherapy practice greatly.

13:38:07
kristina
Let me know if I can be of any use in your goal.

13:38:27
kristina
Welcome, Brenda.

13:38:47
BRENDA L
hi everyone, Brenda here. got a question about undigested food matter in stool.

13:39:01
kristina
Colon tubes help to deliver the coffee enema higher into the colon where it is able to exert its action most effectively on the liver.

13:39:06
dman
adrienne, hmm, it's hard to explain, but before my feet would slightly point outward if standing - maybe a inch to the left and right. now they point closer forward.

13:39:41
AdrienneW
Donna, I am a native Texan (don't live there now, though).  Do u feel that there is some resistance from many Texans (attitude, I mean)?  I can't see many Texans as being very open to it right off the bat (my family being a good example).

13:40:04
Rob D
Any tips/receipts for making lube?

13:40:12
AdrienneW
Interesting, dman.  I don't think I have done this long enough to see these kinds of changes, but that is interesting.

13:40:28
AdrienneW
Coconut oil is my fave.

13:40:48
dman
well, unless you were slighly bow-legged, you probably wouldn't have seen the benefits.

13:40:50
kristina
Coconut oil makes a great enema nozzle lubricant.

13:41:09
BRENDA L
Thanks for the welcome.  in addition to my undigested food question,  i want to ask, should i consider antibiotics for a 2-foot tape i eliminated or stay with the herbal parasitic approach?

13:41:12
kristina
Healthy Cooking Aids and Supplements 

13:42:10
kristina
Brenda, what type of food are you seeing in the stool?

13:42:53
BRENDA L
carrots, pineapple, black bean shells, bile globules.

13:43:03
kristina
Super Salve lubricant - you could follow a similar recipe to the ingredients in this lubricant.

13:43:41
kristina
I see carrots in most people's stool; they aren't easily digested.

13:43:49
AdrienneW
(sorry to interrupt, but, Brenda, what did u use to eliminate tapeworms?)

13:43:49
kristina
Also, I see the bean hulls often.

13:44:11
kristina
Brenda, how do you know you have a 2 foot long tapeworm?

13:45:11
BRENDA L
saw it, felt it come out, lifted it up on a stick.  2 feet, definitely not mucus. very flat, no head

13:45:29
kristina
With all that said, excellent digestion occurs with LOTS of chewing, optimal levels of digestive enzymes within the body, and sometimes added digestive supplements and probiotics.

13:45:54
kristina
Do you know the strength of your own digestion?

13:46:09
AdrienneW
Kristina, do u see many raw vegans as a colon therapist, and do they tend to have difficulty with undigested foods?  I spent some time on that diet and colon hydrotherapy showed a lot of undigested foods.

13:46:16
kristina
Gastrointestinal Health Panel

13:46:25
BRENDA L
I wasn't using anything to stimulate that tape  directly. i have been doing the core restore for a few days.

13:46:44
kristina
Digestion related screens for enzyme levels and immunochemical markers such as Chymotrypsin.

13:47:01
kristina
Did you see a tape worm?

13:47:38
BRENDA L
Yes! at least 2 feet!

13:47:43
kristina
Yikes!

13:48:04
BRENDA L
Don't you see it in the tube?

13:48:19
IowaAlan
Hello all.

13:48:31
kristina
Stick with the Core Restore and after I recommend the Gastrointestinal Health Panel Expanded.

13:48:32
AdrienneW
Hi Alan.

13:48:55
kristina
At this stage, I wouldn't consider antibiotics.

13:49:04
kristina
Hi Alan!

13:49:30
AdrienneW
(antibiotics are just for bacteria anyway, right?)

13:49:40
kristina
Mostly, but not always.

13:50:02
BRENDA L
Didn't think so.  started on parasite purge.

13:50:38
kristina
Yes, Adrienne, I have seen many raw vegans with digestive difficulties over the years.

13:51:07
kristina
Did you take a picture?

13:51:21
IowaAlan
I have been on many narcotics and other meds for chronic back pain. I have been taking the meds for over six years now. If I do not take anything to move the stool through and out, I only have a BM every 5 to 8 days.

13:51:37
kristina
Alan, can you take a daily enema?

13:52:02
kristina
Core Restore Kit

13:52:11
IowaAlan
My question is could have my lower digestive system shut down...and what would be the best way to get it moving again?

13:52:31
IowaAlan
Yes, I should be able to do that.

13:52:46
kristina
How Often to Take an Enema

13:53:07
kristina
Alan, a daily enema would be a great start.

13:53:17
BRENDA L
i was raw vegan for 9 months prior to WAPF diet for last 4 months.  digesting so much better, constipation is nothing like it was either.  the fat, meat and cooked food has been a very good thing.  liver has rebelled with so much fat.

13:53:55
kristina
As the article states, have a seasonal hair tissue mineral analysis to keep track of electrolyte levels, gut integrity, etc.

13:53:58
IowaAlan
Ok should I use a nozzle or a colon tube?

13:54:21
kristina
hair tissue mineral analysis

13:54:41
BRENDA L
Fasting is the only thing that resets my digestion.  Alan, get the core restore from kristina - it is fantastic!

13:54:52
AdrienneW
Brenda, thanks for sharing your experience.  I am new to OHC and WAPF diet, but have noticed significant improvement as well.  I was not very successful on raw veganism.

13:54:58
kristina
Either an enema nozzle or a colon tube: there are advantages to each of these.

13:55:31
IowaAlan
ok, will that keep things moving long term or should I plan to take a daily enema all the time?

13:55:33
dman
kristina, have you heard of any patients who've suffer perforations due to too much enema water?

13:56:06
kristina
We will have to see what happens, Alan. If the bowels are able to move on their own eventually, you won't necessarily need to take the daily enema.

13:56:23
IowaAlan
Ok thanks.

13:56:37
BRENDA L
Raw was good for a while, got me over the hump of major toxemia.  Sure wish i knew about core restore a long time ago.  The 2 day fast was long enoug to reset my digestion (for Alan)

13:56:50
kristina
Start with the daily enema. The Core Restore Program is also an excellent idea. Also, use the HTMA to have a consultation with us.

13:57:01
kristina
No, dman, I have not.

13:57:39
kristina
So glad to hear about this success, Brenda!

13:58:04
kristina
If you have time, write me up a few sentences or more about your experience so that I can post it on the website.

13:58:33
dman
good to hear. this is my only worry, sometimes i want to stop b/c of the cramps, but i instead usually wait it out. The resulting cramp and release seems to be the key to removing old stuff.

13:59:32
kristina
Okay, next Live Chat, May 12th, 7pm, central time 

13:59:45
kristina
I have heard this from many people, dman. 

13:59:51
Dave
See u then

14:00:00
kristina
I have worked with a gentleman who does emergency diaster work.

14:00:12
dman
you should write a book more focused on the internal experiences of colon cleasing.

14:00:19
kristina
He worked for the US government when 9/11 happened.

14:00:21
BRENDA L
Thank you for writing your book.  I have done several of the implants.  worm came out after epsom salt enema and olive oil aloe implant.  powerful for me.  took courage and was messy and i felt junk  for a few hours.

14:00:33
kristina
He became very sick after being in contact with all those toxins.

14:01:03
kristina
He found a Chinese doctor who had him do enemas with raw milk and molasses.

14:01:23
dman
is that advisable?

14:01:41
kristina
They caused him a lot of pain but his experience was that he would then go for months with no intestinal irritation.

14:02:03
kristina
I haven't worked with the protocol enough to advise it at this point.

14:02:12
kristina
You are welcome, Brenda. 

14:02:43
kristina
My book: Kristina's Ten Days to Optimal Health

14:04:13
kristina
dman, great book idea. One technique I use for writing is to have people send me questions. If you have them, send them over and I will see if I can't use them as a launching place for such a book.

14:04:35
kristina
Welcome to the newer folks. We are now just closing the chat as it started one hour ago. It is always central time.

14:04:51
kristina
However, join me any time on Facebook or through email or by calling the Optimal Health Center.

14:04:55
chris h
got ya - can i ask one question?

14:05:01
BRENDA L
Alan please get Core restore for yourself.  i have been dealing with constipation for years.  the liver has so much to do with it.  meds need to be cleaned out of the body.  do yourself a favor and get on that program/diet.  it is fantastic.  

14:05:07
kristina
go ahead, Chris

14:05:27
chris h
your inflatable colon tubes - how long do they usually last?

14:05:46
kristina
Again, the Core Restore Kit

14:06:01
BRENDA L
Also what was the article you were referring to? and thanks a million!

14:06:43
BRENDA L
ALSO ALAN COFFEE ENEMA all in caps!!!!!!!!!

14:06:43
kristina
How long they last can vary, but we don't hear from customers more than once or twice a  year on that.

14:06:59
chris h
thanks

14:07:22
IowaAlan
Really?

14:07:29
kristina
The article Constipation and &quot;The Right Fit&quot; is in the recent newsletter. Sign up for the newsletter on the home page and I will get the April newsletter to you this afternoon.

14:07:44
kristina
Brenda, thanks for being here!

14:07:45
chris h
is there anything you can recommend for intestional inflammation?

14:07:56
IowaAlan
ok, so what brand of coffee should I use?

14:08:04
kristina
So many things, Chris. Might you call the office to determine your next steps?

14:08:17
chris h
ok, thanks 

14:08:23
kristina
Today we have been talking about the successes of the Core Restore Kit

14:08:29
BRENDA L
Coffee is the KEY for me. Gotta be the right coffee too!

14:08:51
kristina
Also, eliminating gluten, dairy, and sugar can often eliminate intestinal inflammation.

14:08:59
BRENDA L
THE BOOK tells you.

14:09:18
kristina
more info on coffee enemas

14:09:21
BRENDA L
No gluten for me anymore.  Not till i heal.

14:09:21
IowaAlan
ouch - I love bread, pasta, and cereal

14:09:46
kristina
http://www.enemabag.com/coffee_enema.html

14:09:47
IowaAlan
I assume the coffee should be room temp?

14:09:55
kristina
or warmer

14:10:04
BRENDA L
Kristina i bought the Vit-Ra-Tox kit - can i do that after i do 28 day core restore?

14:10:12
kristina
yes

14:10:40
BRENDA L
Cool.  thanks again.

14:10:45
kristina
I hope to have more contact with you all again, soon.

14:10:49
kristina
bye now

14:10:51
IowaAlan
ok... I have also read about using soap salt and oils in the enema solution?

14:11:25
BRENDA L
Alan, stick with coffee and core restore.  you'll be a happy man!

14:11:59
IowaAlan
ok where do you get your coffee?

14:12:50
BRENDA L
I do it almost every DAY after the regular enema and get so much SLUDGE OUT. i buy my coffee from whole foods - LIGHT ROAST - ORGANIC!

14:14:35
BRENDA L
I HAVE BEEN A SICK GIRL.  Allopathic is terrible for lots of things.  had every test many times.  Nothing makes me feel better than a coffee enema.  it's all my liver and that's why core restore is so important.  i spent 2 years in bed from a back injury.

14:16:43
BRENDA L
It's worth the money to do the core restore.  not laxatives, fiber, water etc. you need fats and a healthy liver to process it.   You have to fix the irregularity or it will make you very toxic!

14:17:17
BRENDA L
Aloha

14:18:44
donna j
'til next time...Happy Spring everyone.
