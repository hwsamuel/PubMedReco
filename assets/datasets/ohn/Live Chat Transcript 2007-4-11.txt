Hi Kris

Hi Kris

18:00:51&nbsp;
LoneEagle
Did we ever have the chat on how to properly clean an enema bag? And what things we should never put in an enema bag?

18:01:49&nbsp;
Mike K
Not sure LoneEagle 

18:02:57&nbsp;
kristina
What would you like to talk about today, Mike? Have you taken note of the new silicone colon tubes?

18:03:41&nbsp;
kristina
Let's talk about how to clean the enema equipment. Enema equipment, of course, needs to be cleaned thoroughly.

18:03:47&nbsp;
Mike K
I believe the hardest thing to clean on an enema bag is the tubing.

18:04:05&nbsp;
kristina
However, I would never use a cleaning agent on your enema equipment that you wouldn't want in your body. 

18:04:16&nbsp;
LoneEagle
I usually use very hot water with a little ivory bar soap.

18:04:36&nbsp;
kristina
For instance, I know I have told this story before, but one day in at the Optimal Health Center, I was giving a gentleman an enema. 

18:04:48&nbsp;
kristina
The smell of his enema equipment was very odd to me.

18:04:56&nbsp;
kristina
At first, I couldn't figure out what I was smelling.

18:05:04&nbsp;
kristina
Then I asked him what he cleaned his bag with.

18:05:35&nbsp;
kristina
He told me Pine-Sol.

18:05:54&nbsp;
kristina
Hot, hot water is best.

18:06:11&nbsp;
Joseph
I know you mentioned the grapeseed extract, kris

18:06:21&nbsp;
Joseph
with pipe cleaners

18:06:24&nbsp;
Mike K
Pine-Sol is oil-based and will soak into latex or rubber

18:07:02&nbsp;
LoneEagle
Would I be correct to assume that most water heater settings are not hot enough to disinfect totally?

18:07:19&nbsp;
kristina
I also use soap, but I use the Castile soap, as I am confident it doesn't contain any petroleum products or chemical additives that I wouldn't want to end up in my body.

18:07:45&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, the enema equipment that I mentioned reeked of Pine-Sol.

18:08:00&nbsp;
Mike K
you would assume correctly - most water heaters are set between 120&deg; and 140&deg;

18:08:06&nbsp;
kristina
I also do a rinse in Grapefruit Seed Extract to disinfect the bag.

18:08:31&nbsp;
Tim
what about chlorine to clean the bag?

18:08:45&nbsp;
kristina
Soon I will be offering a kit that will work wonders to both clean and dry enema equipment.

18:08:49&nbsp;
LoneEagle
What is the correct ratio of grapeseed oil to water?

18:09:36&nbsp;
kristina
It will come with a hose brush, a bladder brush, and a dryer. 

18:10:57&nbsp;
kristina
Use 15-30 drops of grapefruit seed extract for each 2 gallons of water.

18:11:33&nbsp;
kristina
I would recommend that you *never* use chlorine to clean your enema equipment.

18:12:49&nbsp;
Mike K
chlorine will dissipate in 24 hours if left in the open air and sunlight

18:13:26&nbsp;
kristina
But will it dissipate from the inside of a bag?

18:13:51&nbsp;
Mike K
IF left to dry, yes

18:15:05&nbsp;
Mike K
But it should be rinsed with plain water

18:15:34&nbsp;
kristina
And, given that GSE is a natural quatenary compound synthesized from the seed and pulp of certified organically grown grapefruit, I feel it is a better choice for disinfecting the equipment

18:16:17&nbsp;
LoneEagle
I have also heard of mixing hydrogen peroxide in with the enema water to loosen impacted stool material.  Is this a good thing to do?

18:17:18&nbsp;
kristina
I have not studied the applications of hydrogen peroxide in the colon. I would love it if someone did and reported to me.

18:18:20&nbsp;
kristina
However, as far as loosening impacted stool material, peppermint essential oil works.

18:19:01&nbsp;
kristina
I want to point to our new silicone colon tube.

18:19:49&nbsp;
LoneEagle
OK, I better get some of that. I would like to have a colon hydrotherapy session or sessions but I cannot find a therapist within 150 miles

18:19:58&nbsp;
Mike K
Is it made of the new stiffer materal?

18:20:30&nbsp;
kristina
I decided to develop a colon tube that was larger, 42 Fr, with a removable delrin cap, because I was continually hearing that people who used the other colon tubes to insert more than 4-8 inches into the colon would find that the colon tubes would likely fold back on themselves.

18:20:36&nbsp;
kristina
This colon tube will not do that. Also, the larger delrin cap disperses the pressure over a larger area, making this a safer colon tube for deeper insertions.

18:22:44&nbsp;
kristina
The tip is removable but it will never come off in the colon.

18:24:23&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, it is a stiffer material

18:25:52&nbsp;
kristina
The wall thickness is 1/8&quot; (17.6 mm)

18:26:43&nbsp;
kristina
It is also low compression set, odorless, nontoxic

18:28:44&nbsp;
kristina
Does anyone have plans for a spring cleanse?

18:28:54&nbsp;
LoneEagle
What type of dryer will your new cleaning kit have?

18:30:01&nbsp;
kristina
The dryer is a plastic device that is like a hanger but can be compressed to fit in a small hole. When you release it, it expands so that the inside of the bag will stay open for easier and more complete drying.

18:30:10&nbsp;
LoneEagle
I do not but I sure need a good cleanse - I had a constipation due to narcotic use for over two years

18:30:40&nbsp;
kristina
It is called a Bladder Dryer.

18:30:41&nbsp;
LoneEagle
That should dry faster

18:31:21&nbsp;
kristina
Lone Eagle... would you like to lay out a program that you follow for the next while to clean out?

18:32:06&nbsp;
LoneEagle
That would be a good start for me

18:32:51&nbsp;
mrj73
Hi Kristina, and all so great to be here with you

18:33:04&nbsp;
kristina
Welcome to you, too. What do you have on your mind today?

18:33:18&nbsp;
kristina
Where do you live, Lone Eagle?

18:33:21&nbsp;
LoneEagle
And then a second program to keep me cleaned out

18:33:28&nbsp;
LoneEagle
Iowa

18:33:30&nbsp;
kristina
Are you still constipated? 

18:33:37&nbsp;
kristina
How often do your bowels move?

18:34:08&nbsp;
LoneEagle
Yes and I have been taking Miralax also

18:34:24&nbsp;
LoneEagle
Every 2 or three days

18:34:42&nbsp;
kristina
Do you take enemas? How often? How many?

18:35:21&nbsp;
LoneEagle
I try to take two enemas a week, usually just one at a time

18:35:59&nbsp;
kristina
You mean you only fill your colon one time, sit on the toilet and release the ensuing waste and water and then you are done?

18:36:12&nbsp;
LoneEagle
Yes

18:37:07&nbsp;
kristina
Well, let's see, would you be willing to take more enemas for the next week and then report to me on the colon health forum or would you rather take cascara sagrada orally to assure a daily bowel movement?

18:37:23&nbsp;
kristina
Also, are you currently experiencing any symptoms of ill health?

18:37:36&nbsp;
mrj73
Hi lisa, u water woman?

18:37:48&nbsp;
kristina
Welcome, LISA!!!

18:37:48&nbsp;
Lisa
Hi everyone! Hope the chat is going well. Sorry I have to be late!

18:38:00&nbsp;
kristina
Better late than never as they say!

18:38:07&nbsp;
Lisa
Yes, Lisa is waterwoman!

18:38:30&nbsp;
LoneEagle
I have tried taking a second enema after releasing the first one, but my body wants to expel the second one right after the water first enters

18:38:35&nbsp;
mrj73
Great to chat with you, I have read so much about you all I feel like I know you

18:38:55&nbsp;
kristina
What solution do you use in the first enema?

18:39:06&nbsp;
kristina
What solution have you tended to use in the second enema?

18:39:20&nbsp;
LoneEagle
I think the series of enemas would work better, right?

18:39:35&nbsp;
kristina
How long do you sit on the toilet after the first enema? How much waste and water comes out after the first enema?

18:39:36&nbsp;
LoneEagle
Just water for both

18:39:51&nbsp;
kristina
The enema series will more fully clear out the entire colon. 

18:40:02&nbsp;
Lisa
Kristina, the goat milk soap is a life-saver to me. It got me through an uncomfortable time.

18:40:06&nbsp;
kristina
How much water do you use?

18:40:11&nbsp;
kristina
Tell me more, Lisa.

18:40:16&nbsp;
LoneEagle
I sit for five to ten minutes and I do not think all of the water comes out

18:40:33&nbsp;
LoneEagle
One or two quarts

18:40:43&nbsp;
kristina
Have you ever tried to sit for a longer time on the toilet or massage your belly while you are sitting on the toilet?

18:40:59&nbsp;
mrj73
Kristina, do you feel the series helps remove old build-up as in diverticulitious (spelled that wrong)

18:41:06&nbsp;
kristina
Or get up after the five to ten minutes and jump up and down for a bit and then sit back on the toilet?

18:41:24&nbsp;
LoneEagle
I will expel a lot of water at first, then a little at a time for the next few minutes

18:41:35&nbsp;
Lisa
I'm not overeating, but at times I feel like I get so bloated. The soap made me 100% better followed by a peppermint and sea salt enema.

18:42:12&nbsp;
kristina
The enema series more effectively clears out the entire colon, giving the benefits of a professional colon hydrotherapy session in your own home. Where a single enema will most likely only clear out the first 1/3rd, at best, of the colon - the rectal and sigmoid areas of the colon.

18:42:41&nbsp;
kristina
Ideally, when you take a therapeutic enema series, you will clear out the colon all the way to the cecum or to the colon's end.

18:42:43&nbsp;
LoneEagle
I also have elevated liver enzymes due to anti-inflammatory medication

18:43:52&nbsp;
kristina
Lone Eagle, I think if you experimented with goat's milk soap and peppermint and sea salt, like Lisa describes, you would more likely get out what you need to in the first enema and be able to take a second enema successfully.

18:44:10&nbsp;
kristina
Do you always let the water into the colon 1/2 to 1 cup at a time and no more than that?

18:45:09&nbsp;
mrj73
 I am able to have BM 1-4 times a day, but I am hoping to start on some herb such as Dr. Schulze's program.  I have a feeling that the enemas I have had, need a little help. continue in a minute - not enough room

18:45:16&nbsp;
kristina
Bottom line for you Lone Eagle is to get your bowels moving daily. Daily enemas for a while or cascara sagrada

18:45:51&nbsp;
LoneEagle
I never looked to see where your office was located before. really not as far as I thought you were. Do you think you could get me off to a good start if I would see you for a session or sessions? And how many days to you think it might take to do that?

18:45:56&nbsp;
mrj73
 I will try the series as  mentioned, but do any of you feel that that program I mentioned would assist with psoriasis, and inflammation widespread?

18:46:34&nbsp;
LoneEagle
No, I think I was trying to fill way to fast

18:46:39&nbsp;
kristina
Please look into Herbal Fiberblend as a comparison to Dr. Schulze's products

18:46:47&nbsp;
mrj73
thank you

18:47:34&nbsp;
kristina
Yes. Many people come from out-of-state to the Optimal Health Center. Last week I had a woman who came for three days all the way from Kuwait, just to work with us here at the clinic. 

18:47:44&nbsp;
kristina
I have a couple coming up from North Carolina in two weeks.

18:48:20&nbsp;
kristina
People will take full advantage of a daily colon cleanse, diet recommendations, the FIR sauna and the massage therapy.

18:48:28&nbsp;
Lisa
When I first meet Kristina, I came up from Texas!

18:48:36&nbsp;
kristina
Filling slowly is key to taking in water.

18:48:49&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, and then there is Lisa, who has come from Texas a couple of times!

18:49:11&nbsp;
Mike K
a flowmaster bulb helps too

18:50:07&nbsp;
mrj73
Kristina, I  have my terrible docs saying no no no, I have POTS - would that be safe for me to use a colonic compared to enemas?

18:50:17&nbsp;
Lisa
Dave comes from the DC area and has been going to Kris for many years! By the way, Dave can't get logged in here!

18:50:30&nbsp;
LoneEagle
Will the oral remedies you have suggested cause any cramping or make needing to go a right-now event?

18:50:50&nbsp;
kristina
You will need to add therapeutic fats such as coconut oil to the diet in order to resolve psoriasis. Also, are you a woman or a man, as you might need some hormonal support.

18:51:20&nbsp;
mrj73
woman. Kris, I have just ordered some that was linked from the forum

18:51:32&nbsp;
mrj73
coconut

18:51:49&nbsp;
LoneEagle
Lisa can I PM you?

18:52:10&nbsp;
Lisa
Sure you can!

18:52:22&nbsp;
kristina
No, I can even use cascara sagrada, and my colon is one of the most sensitive colons around, and I never experience cramping or an &quot;I have to go immediately&quot; problem. You do need to play around with the dosage and not be restricted by the capsule. For instance, some people only need to take 1/2 a capsule of cascara sagrada herbal laxative, while others need 2.

18:52:41&nbsp;
kristina
Did you order Progest E, progesterone in Vitamin E?

18:52:49&nbsp;
LoneEagle
OK, glad to hear that

18:52:52&nbsp;
kristina
Rub that on your skin with the coconut oil. 

18:53:33&nbsp;
kristina
Dave is coming in next week, too.

18:53:42&nbsp;
mrj73
Is it your opinion that the toxins from the bowel/liver are the culprit in psoriasis or something else? I am very confused about what I should use at this point

18:54:05&nbsp;
kristina
Our next live chat will be on May 9th

18:54:47&nbsp;
LoneEagle
thanks Kristina

18:55:05&nbsp;
Lisa
My first visit to OHN was scary. I wasn't used to enemas yet, but wanted to learn more about them. Kristina really put me at ease. She's so nice!!

18:55:10&nbsp;
kristina
I have excellent results working with people with psoriasis. I think that it a low-fat diet and a hormonal imbalance and often food allergies.

18:55:27&nbsp;
mrj73
ok

18:55:31&nbsp;
mrj73
thank you

18:56:08&nbsp;
kristina
Have you started working with the nutritional and cleansing ideas within my book, mrj73?

18:56:53&nbsp;
mrj73
my guy just ordered it for me so I should have it soon. he wants some answers for me also

18:57:13&nbsp;
LoneEagle
Lisa, is OHN set up more like a health club then?

18:57:22&nbsp;
mrj73
he has watched me suffer so long and I am willing to try anything except more drugs at this point

18:57:27&nbsp;
kristina
I thank you all so very much for joining me tonight. I can't tell you how honored I am to have your company. Please do keep in touch on the colon health forum and via email over the month.

18:57:33&nbsp;
kristina
who is &quot;your guy&quot;?

18:57:57&nbsp;
mrj73
Oh, he is not a member - he is Mr. Brown

18:58:14&nbsp;
mrj73
do you process your own orders for those?

18:58:18&nbsp;
kristina
a friend who is helping you improve your health?

18:58:23&nbsp;
mrj73
yes

18:58:34&nbsp;
Lisa
OHN is getting more of a health club since they have a sauna, and you can get a great massage too!

18:58:50&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, we process our own orders. You can order by calling us at 608-242-0200 or by placing an order on our website

18:59:14&nbsp;
kristina
However, the Progest E isn't available online as I only want for people to take it whom I work with directly.

18:59:41&nbsp;
kristina
You all have an excellent month.  Thanks for all the support and hard work everyone.

19:00:00&nbsp;
mrj73
thank you 

19:00:27&nbsp;
Mike K
kristina,  talk to you later (namaste)

19:00:32&nbsp;
kristina
OHC is a small, family-run business that offers lots of love and is a very relaxed place. When you are here, you are the center of our attention and there are very few other people around.

19:00:42&nbsp;
kristina
Bye!
