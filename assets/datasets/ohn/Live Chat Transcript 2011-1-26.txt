A most happy winter to all you chatters.

12:57:49
michael b
How is your weather in madison?

12:59:07
michael b
DeeDee, are you running the chat today?

13:01:19
deedee
Hello everyone. I was just tied up with a client.  How is everyone?

13:01:25
Dave
Thanks, DeeDee and Kris, for including my testimonial in the new newsletter. It was heartfelt. A lot of interesting material in the newsletter too.

13:02:04
dennis r
Is a liquid vitamin added to an enema benefical for the body?

13:02:08
deedee
Thank you for the testimonial.  We love them and love to put them into the newsletter.

13:02:36

Hello to DeeDee from Iowa.

13:03:19
razoriowa
Is lavender oil as good to use as peppermint?

13:03:31
deedee
Hi Dennis. To answer that question, we know that the colon is na area of high absorption, so yes, anything put into the colon water has a great chance of absorption.

13:03:51
dennis r
Please tell people you can't lose weight by taking an enema!

13:04:27
Dave
Doing well, despite the fact I'm currently on 4 drugs that have constipation as a side effect! It calls for extra colon care, lol. 

13:04:32
donnaj
Donna Gates mentioned putting raw apple cider vinegar in the enema water to clear mucus.  What do you think?

13:04:35
Philip W
We emailed about the temperature of the elimination water.  Has it been shown that different temperatures encourage different rates of elimination?

13:05:34
deedee
Enemas can be a great addition to a weight loss program because weight is a symptom of toxicity and so when we detoxify with a colon cleanse,

13:05:36
deedee
 we are allowing the body to have the ability to get rid of toxins and therefore weight that is stored in our fat cells.

13:06:59
michael b
I am sorry to say I have not done much with the trace minerals yet, but will soon. Where is Kristina? I hope she is well.

13:07:48
deedee
Yes, apple cider vinegar can be a great addition in an enema for many reasons.  

13:08:02
dennis r
I found wearing a back brace during an enema helps to control cramping.

13:08:26
deedee
Wearing a back brace is a great idea for support.  Thanks for the idea.

13:08:42
deedee
Kristina has been busy writing and promoting, etc.

13:08:56
Dave
donnaj: a now-retired colon therapist told me that organic raw apple cider with the &quot;mother&quot; solids is the only enema ingredient she would take herself.

13:09:00
deedee
Welcome, Joseph.

13:09:25
Joseph
Hello. Thank you, DeeDee.

13:09:32
donnaj
Thanks, Dave.

13:10:18
deedee
Apple cider vinegar contains over 40 vitamins and minerals.  It is good for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, insomnia, fatigue, arthritis...

13:10:32
clairew
A day or two after I do an enema series, I experience gas.  Anything I can do for it?

13:10:34
dennis r
By using my back brace during my enema, I can take in more water and even hold it in longer.

13:11:48
deedee
Phillip, to get to your question, cooler water can either make the colon cramp and sometimes causes the body to hold, but can also cause the body to purge more quickly, so it can be quite individual.

13:12:07
donnaj
Is there any reason not to do enemas daily? 

13:12:24
Dave
Regardless of ingredients, the therapist thought  moms were wise to give enemas. She first got them from a visiting nurse when pregnant.

13:13:18
deedee
Hi Claire. You can try adding fennel and/or peppermint essential oil to your water and sometimes Celtic sea salt enemas can help as well.

13:14:14
deedee
What are some different things you guys have tried in your enemas that either have worked well or not?

13:14:59
Dave
Connected with donnaj's question, friend Bill K would like to know if enemas can be addictive. Would weekly be OK?

13:15:37
deedee
For those who receive our newsletter, you probably have read that I am doing personalized mixtures of essential oils to use in your enema water, topically, orally, etc., depending on your personal issues.  We have found them to be wonderful.

13:16:07
Joseph
I've used goldenseal capsules emptied in the water to help fight a cold.

13:16:33
dennis r
For sure, I can't ever have an enema with just water alone. The cramps are real bad. Celtic sea salt works best.

13:16:33
deedee
Our wonderful helper Linda has also put together some bath/detoxifying salts which include epsom salts, dead sea salts, coconut oil, and baking soda.  I can then personalize your oil to go with it.

13:17:02
Dave
On personalized, would a lemongrass colonic followed by a coffee enema be OK and not cancel each other out?

13:17:22
deedee
Goldenseal is wonderful!  and everything is absorbed so much more quickly and  efficiently in the colon than by mouth.

13:17:44
poppajoejr
DeeDee, I am curious about the apple cider vinegar enema and how to use it. Do you mix it or use it full strength?

13:18:02
Joseph
Yes, it usually kicks out my cold very quickly.

13:18:07
deedee
Yes, I have done lemongrass during the cleansing part of the enema followed by a coffee implant and it works wonderfully.  

13:18:20
deedee
Hi, Poppajoejr.

13:19:26
deedee
You would use 1 - 4 Tablespoons of apple cider vinegar in 2 quarts of warm water.

13:19:59
dennis r
DeeDee, you're doing a great job in our chat. I'm sure everyone feels the same way. Keep it up!

13:21:30
Dave
Thanks, DeeDee. We'll be trying that next. 

13:21:36
Joseph
Oh yes, great chat!

13:21:41
deedee
I think weekly enemas are just fine.  I think the addiction comes into play like anything else, when you are using them for other purposes that may not be the healthiest and excessively without the physical need.

13:22:02
deedee
Thank you so much for the kind words of encouragement.

13:23:10
dennis r
Milwaukee wishes everyone a Happy St. Valentines Day!

13:24:03
donnaj
Right now I don't go at all unless I do an enema.  I've had constipation for years and sometimes have not had a bm for over a week.

13:24:43
Dave
Thanks. My enemas from early times were always needed, and same today. My newest therapist was given them weekly as a child for chronic constipation  but would echo what you said.

13:25:45
deedee
Donna, you are the type of person that needs enemas more regularly because of your issues.

13:26:39
deedee
Donna, how often are you doing enemas right now?

13:26:53
deedee
Welcome, Jack.

13:27:27
Jack A.
Thanks. Sorry to be late.

13:28:01
donnaj
I'm averaging 3 times per week.  I'm not feeling like I'm clearing my entire colon.

13:29:29
Dave
Same therapist, who is 60+ and from Europe, said she had her first colonic when 17  years old and 5 months pregnant. No ill effects, but has OHN covered the topic of enemas and colonics and pregnancy in case others would be interested?

13:30:32
michael b
I think the different oils offered by Young Living are amazing ,and their concept of diffusing the same oils into the air we breath is most interesting.

13:31:01
deedee
Donna, maybe we can make the cleaning out more efficient for you so that you feel like you are getting everything.  It makes a difference of how much water you are using, what is in the water, the equipment you are using, etc.

13:31:08
dennis r
Dr. Oz on TV supports enemas. He talked about that not long ago.

13:32:26
deedee
I love Young Living oils!  The more I research all of the different kinds, the more intrigued I get.  Some of them have been used since ancient times and have quite a healing history.  It is all facinating.

13:33:08
deedee
 I am almost done with my 18-month herbal class this month, and herbs and oils are so effective that we should be using them so much more regularly than we are and avoiding medications with a ton of side effects.

13:33:37
Jack A.
DeeDee, is there a particular combination of soap, water, peppermint, etc., that would  help a person eliminate a 2/3 quart enema rather than retaining it, or most of it, for hours?

13:33:44
deedee
Yes, I have heard that Dr. Oz is an enema promoter.

13:33:59
donnaj
I have the 4-qt silicone bag.  Do the essential oils gunk up the tubing at all?

13:34:48
deedee
Jack, I would try the soap, peppermint, and salt separately at first so you can tell if there is one thing that is making you hold.  How much salt are you currently using per quart?

13:35:40
deedee
Essential oils do need to be rinsed well with hot soapy water afterwards to eliminate the residue, but they are such pure oils that we don't have much problems with them.

13:35:47
deedee
Hi, Scott.

13:35:53
Dave
Could it be re Dr. Oz that you might actually find enema equipment in stores again someday? OHN also could benefit, lol.

13:36:12
Jack A.
One teaspoon per quart, plus one extra just because.

13:36:32
Scott
Hi DeeDee and all. Sorry I'm late.

13:37:20
deedee
This can be different for everyone, but 1 Tablespoon per quart make the water isotonic, which is supposed to help with eliminating the retaining factor of the water.

13:37:32
deedee
Hi, DanH.

13:37:45
donnaj
I have used sea salt, but not essential oils.  Maybe I should try some peppermint.

13:38:26
deedee
Peppermint and sea salt can work well together.  About 3-4 drops per quart

13:38:46
DanH
Hi, DeeDee.

13:39:07
deedee
We have such a wonderful group today! 

13:39:16
Jack A.
What about water temperature?

13:39:19
donnaj
Ok, thanks.

13:39:34
deedee
Water temp. should be between body temp. and 105 or so.

13:41:18
Dave
DeeDee, we're just all backed up - with questions :D 

13:41:26
deedee
Dave, since you have done enemas awhile, do you have any tips on the temp. and on eliminating water that doesn't want to leave?  Massaging the abdomen is very important also.

13:41:42
DanH
Joining late, but upon 2 or 3 cleansing enemas, has there been any discussion regarding implants afterward?

13:43:28
dennis r
After inserting a quart, I clamp off the water for 5 mins. to give my body the chance to warm it up, because water cools down quickly in the bag. It helps me.

13:43:58
Scott
I've found that retention is more likely with very warm solutions. Massage and positional changes help move things for me.

13:43:59
deedee
Dan, we have been talking a little bit about how effective the colon is at absorbing, so that minerals, herbs, essential oils, etc. can work wonders.  Do you have a particular thing you want to implant?

13:44:39
Dave
 I've not had a big retention problem. I do find I do a lot of absorption when dehydrated, but I guess that is to be expected? Soap suds help prevent retention.

13:46:06
deedee
Yes, soap can be very helpful because it is purging - especially peppermint.

13:46:29
Scott
I agree that soap suds preclude retention.

13:47:26
dennis r
Interesting session today. Thanks DeeDee! Talk again soon, bye!

13:47:41
deedee
Thanks, Dennis. Come back again.

13:48:25
Jack A.
Me too. Many thanks!

13:48:40
michael b
Oh, please tell Ms. Amelong, as the late Hoyt Axton said, work your fingers to the bone and what do you get? Boney fingers.

13:48:49
deedee
Thank you - any other question that people want to get in?

13:49:10
DanH
DeeDee, my wife and I retain coffee implants for up to 45-60 minutes.  It works well after 2-3 cleansing sessions.  We've done a recipe of olive, coconut, flaxseed oils, MSM, bifidonate, aloe vera juice, and pure water.  Any other recipes?

13:49:37
deedee
Michael, hah!  I will tell her that.  I know her wrists bother her when she is doing too much typing.

13:50:10
Dave
I'm not alone in being raised with Ivory. I think the purpose was to irritate the colon and promote elimination, right? Temp 100F more or less seems best.

13:50:24
deedee
Hi Dan, you guys do quite the implant and I am impressed with the holding time.  How much fluid are you using?

13:51:48
deedee
There are so many different implants and I am currently exploring more and more with herbal and essential oil combinations.  What are you looking for specifically in your implant?  Healing from something specific?

13:51:50
poppajoejr
Very interesting. Signing off. Thanks.

13:52:05
DanH
We reduce the volume of liquid overall and retain an implant of 1/2 to 3/4 of a clear bag we purchase from you.

13:52:06
deedee
Thank you.

13:53:22
donnaj
Is soap such a good idea if you already have an irritated colon?

13:53:34
deedee
Hello buzzard - any quick questions from you?

13:53:42
Scott
Green Palmolive was very common as I was growing up. Very difficult to retain and way too harsh. Bronner's peppermint and regular castille soap packs are my preference these days.

13:54:03
michael b
I can't help think your typing speed is picking up. Anyway, tell Kristina she is missed.  

13:54:25
deedee
Soap can be extra irritating for those who have irritation already.  In that case I would use something more soothing, like sea salt and lavender, chamomile, etc.

13:54:54
Joseph
Thank you very much DeeDee. Be well and hope to catch you next time!

13:55:21
clairew
Thanks for a good chat.

13:55:40
Dave
Yes, Bronner's and OHN's goat milk are mine along with purified water. Don't know why Ivory was so popular.

13:55:48
deedee
I remember the green Palmolive.  Good thing we've moved past that.  I really like the Dr. Bronnner's because it is all natural.

13:56:11
Dave
You were given Palmolive?

13:56:13
deedee
Hi Don.

13:56:40
DanH
DeeDee, nothing at the moment; however, prostate will be something to research for the future.  I'm reaching that age where I need to be in a prevention mode.

13:56:49
deedee
NO, not for enemas, but I remember it for dishes!  Had to do a lot of those!

13:57:23
Dave
Always something to bring back bad memories, lol.

13:57:32
deedee
I have  new ideas for the prostate, so that would be a good next chat topic.

13:57:36
Scott
I only use soap when a good purge is necessary. Soothing solutions are the most common.

13:58:43
deedee
Yes, soothing is better and makes for a more positive outlook on colon cleansing!

13:58:49
donnaj
Thanks for all the good info.

13:58:58
deedee
Thanks Donna, come again

13:59:00
michael b
Do you still have a lot of snow?

13:59:02
Scott
The prostate issue is a good one. I've been using enemas for over 50 years and the urologist tells me that my prostate is in way good shape.

13:59:36
deedee
We do have a fair amount of snow, but we are having a 20 degree heat wave now and by Sat. it is supposed to be 30, so hopefully some melting will happen.

13:59:54
Dave
Great session and I think we shared a lot.

13:59:54
michael b
brrrrr.

14:00:17
dennis r
I beat Scott, I've taken enemas for over 63 yrs.

14:00:22
DanH
Sorry, it's 74 degrees today in CA.

14:00:28
deedee
Yes, very good session with a lot of input - thanks to everyone who joined in or just listened.

14:00:49
deedee
I love CA.

14:00:52
Scott
Best wishes to you DeeDee, Kristina, and all!

14:00:56
donnaj
It helps me to read that folks have been using enemas for so many years.

14:02:07
deedee
Thank you so much everyone.

14:02:07
michael b
The information found in chats like this is most helpful.

14:02:13
DanH
DeeDee, when will you chat about the prostate topic?

14:02:58
donnaj
Thanks again.

14:03:03
deedee
We can bring up the prostate topic next month.

14:03:22
Dave
Good Day to share. Seems like solid advice consideriNG what else you find on the internet.

14:03:27
DanH
Great, thanks for today, bye.

14:03:38
deedee
Thanks again, everyone!  Healthy, happy month to everyone.
