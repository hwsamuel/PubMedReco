To begin, I was recently diagnosed with IBS, but I have had a sensitive stomach since I was a child. This issue became really bad this summer (May/June 2011). Basically, everytime I would eat/drink I would either vomit or instantly get diarrhea. I lost a lot of weight over a short period of time. I went to the hospital/doctors and was tested for ulcers, Celiac disease, stomach bacterias, UTI, pregnancy, among a few other things that, to be quite honest, I'm not really sure what they were. According to my doctor, everything came back negative and I was put on anti-depressants. I have been on them for the past few months now, and while in the beginning I felt a lot better...I gained back some weight and I wasn't getting nearly as nauseated as before. However, the problem has began to arise again. I am throwing up a lot more, and recently almost passed out (I did have a pretty bad cold, and might possibly be diabetic - both grandmothers are - and I often feel extremely weak/lightheaded when I haven't eaten for a few hours). My left backside hurts, and I have previously, years ago, injured my kidney, and it is tender in the same area. I am waiting for a colonoscopy appointment, and am currently trying to find a new doctor for a second opinion. I am just looking for some sort of help. I have tried altering my diet, drinking ginger tea, using anti-nausea medication. I am on heartburn meds and have tried pepto, etc. If anyone has any suggestions, please help me!
