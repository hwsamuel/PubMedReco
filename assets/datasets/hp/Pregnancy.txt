1. Change the way you take your diet while pregnant, to lessen overfilling your stomach and raising heartburn symptoms. 2. Select food items carefully and prevent those that usually grow heartburn symptoms, like hot and spicy fare, carbonated beverages, chocolate and acidic foods like tomatoes and citrus fruits. 3. Avoid taking foods too close to bed time, when heartburn is more likely to happen. Acids are more apt to back up when the body is in a reclining position and gravity is not present to keep them in the stomach.
