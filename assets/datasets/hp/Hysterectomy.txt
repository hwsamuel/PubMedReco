I had a hysterectomy a year ago due to endometriosis. I know all the books say that hysterectomies are overused, that doctors are too eager to operate, etc., but I have to say I'm really glad I had the surgery. Before my hysterectomy, I spent at least a week every month dealing with cramps so severe I often couldn't go to work. The only thing they responded to was muscle relaxants and narcotic pain medications, so I basically spent one-fourth of the month doped to the gills. Now I feel like I have my life back. I know hysterectomy isn't the right choice for every woman, but it worked out great for me. Does anyone else have a hysterectomy story (positive or negative) to share?

When I developed a bleeding problem, I had a resection and ablation, and kept my uterus. The doctors were stunned when I threw that option at them, and I could tell by their reaction that they were perfectly aware that the procedure works, they were just too lazy to mention it. To each their own, but I want to remain intact.

Good for you knowing an alternative to what they wanted to do!

I really think that it is a personal choice between you and your doctor as to what would work the best for you. I think what you did Sagemother by doing your own research is a great idea. It is best to be informed as to your options.

My friend had a hysterectomy several years ago, and it gave her a new lease of life. She was tired, pale &amp; ill looking before the operation, with no real reason for it. I do agree that hysterectomies are perhaps used as a first resort rather than last today. However, there's certainly some positive stories out there.

Doesn't this cause you to have huge mood swing attacks?

One good thing about having a hysterectomy is that it has made me eligible for new/experimental treatments for my bipolar, whereas before doctors wouldn't try them because there was always a &quot;chance&quot; that I'd get pregnant. (This in spite of the fact that I've been an out lesbian since I was in my twenties.) It sounds strange to say, but I really haven't regretted my decision one bit, and this past year has been one of the healthiest of my life.

Calypso, check me on this, but I think that the huge mood swings will be a thing of the past without the uterus because there won't be all the hormones produced. I think?

I have not had a hystorectomy but I'm glad it was such a good experience for you. I know not everyone's is so I'm glad it was good for you!

I'm experiencing the same loss of a week for the last 6 plus years and now find myself freaking out about having to decide full or partial? What did you have Calypso? Any advice? Hope that all is still positive as it is nice to hear the positive - the more I read the more negatives which worries me :-s
