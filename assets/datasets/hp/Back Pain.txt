hey around a month ago i started to have a slight pain in my lower back but it seem to go just as fast as it came now it seems to just come and go .. and when i get it it comes on strong and it makes it hard to do anything here is some info on me and the pain i am having age - 19 pain - lower back where - feels like its on the spine i have it right now and the best way to describe it is 1) when it first comes its mild and easy to cope with 2) after a short time the pain starts to get worse 3) even with a535 / pain killers / heating pad it still makes it hard to do anything 4) when i take a deep breath it seems to make it hurt more while i inhale 5) no matter when i do sleep seems to be impossible when i get it at night it doesn't seem to last to long .. even tho it feels like it at the time pain sticks around 4 - 6 hours and then just seems to fade away heating pad does seem to help after using it for a few hours --------------------------------------------------------------------- now i know the smart thing here to do would be to go see a doctor but right now that is not an option i am from the uk and i am in canada on a visa i looked in to going to a doctor and they wanted $200 just for me to see one at the walk in more info on me that could have started it around 5 years ago i was in a car crash with a friend of mine the car went at just a little 50mph in to a lamp post i came out of it 100 fine and with out a scratch .. but my back did start to ache a short while after that and then it just went away the doctor said that it was nothing and i shouldn't worry about it .. gave me some pain med's and sent me on my way

Most of the people have the back pain problem. There are many reasons for back pains and it also have different types also. I think, it is better to take the suggestions from you doctor who will describe you better about it and will try to decrease your problem otherwise it is very hard for you in future because your age is also very low. So, take care and concern your doctor.
