Hi, I'm looking for some help with a personal project.. I am in the process of compiling an online magazine dedicated exclusively to stories, experiences and art dealing with mental health and addictions. My hope is to give a voice to some underrepresented groups while providing interesting and compelling material to the reader. Currently the plan is to self-publish the magazine online and eventually secure some funding for a print version. For now all submissions are not compensated but if the magazine goes to print, deffered payment will be made to contributors. I am hoping to compile a series of stories and first person accounts related to mental health and addiction issues. If you would like to submit your stories, experiences, art, poetry, etc. Please do so at: sowhatonline at gmail dot com You may remain anonymous if you choose. I am specifically looking for the following but am interested in anything engaging and compelling as long as it deals with the subject of mental health and addictions. - experiences with OCD - experiences with HPPD (hallucinogen persisting perception disorder - first person stories/accounts of life with schizophrenia or bi-polar disorder - your own personal tactics of kicking a drug cold turkey, do you have a system? Can you provide a step by step 'user guide' for quitting cold turkey for drugs like heroin, methamphetamine, crack/cocaine, alcohol, prescription pain medicine, anti-psychotics, anti depressants - personal accounts of multiple relapses - Art work; painting, photography, etc. by people affected by mental health or addiction issues - Poetry by people affected by mental health or addiction issues Thanks.
