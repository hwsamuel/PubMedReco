My boyfriend has severe sleep apnea, and we heard that a somnoplasty may help to relieve some symptoms. We live in Canada but are willing to travel to the states if necessary, as we have yet to find a surgeon who will perform one. If anyone has any information please let me know

hello if he has severe sleep apnea please try the cpap machine first then investigate the other possibilities like laup . somnoplasty is very expensive and results are not good . i had it done after my laup and it only helped a little bit for snoring but my apnea was gone because of the laup . ohip has set the price doctors can charge for somnoplasty so my ear nose and throat doctor has stopped doing it . there's no money in it after the machine fees . i hope this helps you out . i am still looking for a somnoplasty doctor with no luck yet. (i just want my snoring lower in volume or gone completely )
