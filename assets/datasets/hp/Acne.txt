My younger sister is 13, and she is just getting really bad acne. She breaks out a lot, and is looking for something that she can use at home, instead of buying it at the store. These treatments just don't seem to work for her. Any home remedies you recommend?

Making a honey and White Willos mask might be effective. White Willo bark has salicylic acid, aka aspirin, which is also found in many facial cleansers formulated to treat acne.

I have heard that witch hazel can be effective when it comes to acne. I seem to recall that it should be dabbed on with a cotton ball.

I was told that you could use fresh lime juice mixed in a glass of boiled milk and apply to the pimple as like a face wash. This is supposed to help them to go away faster.

Thank you all for the suggestions. I have written them all down and am going to give them to here to try and sample. I guess we will see how these work!

Maybe someone else who's tried using hydrogen peroxide for acne could comment on that. I've never tried it on acne, but I've used it for a razor rash and found it to be the most effective remedy I know.

I have used hydrogen peroxide for many things, but never to treat acne. It is effective for cuts and scrapes, I've found. Maybe that's another thing I could recommend.

Steaming the skin to open the pores &amp; remove dirt can be done easily at home. Add some tea tree oil to the water.

Alot of people are using Aloe Vera for their acne. This is the next big thing so you may want to recommend this to her and see if it works for her.

ive tried everything for when i had severe acne. hydrogen peroxide and white hazel are the cheapest and easiest to apply after having a shower.

I've also heard good things about peroxide. I've recently heard that dabbing with honey can help as it's antibacterial and using apple cider vinegar (organic) is also supposed to help but the fragrance is VERY strong.

Weird as it would look, I heard dabbing Milk of Magnesia and later washing it off with a warm cloth or rinsing off in the shower works. My neice is on it now and said it seems to be working. Let me know if you try it and it does work. Cheap if it does work.

Another point about the hydrogen peroxide on the razor rash - When you first apply it, it seems to turn the affected flesh white, but that colouring seems to go away and it looks much better after a few minutes. I used to make the mistake of washing away the white part with a cloth, which only irritated the condition.

I found out that a friend of mine is having problems with this as well and some of the zits try to turn into small boils, turns out he is having problems with the stuff they put in some foods like store bought puddings. He has stopped eating foods like this and is pretty well clearing up.

We are in the habit of posting recommendation before even having a complete knowledge about the object. Can you please share the period from which he is suffering from this skin disease? In addition to this also tell me the type of skin he has,the reason is that the treatment varies from case to case. http://notyouraveragebootcamp.com/bootcamps.php
