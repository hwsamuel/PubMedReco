If you own a website or blog, I am sure you must have visited the sites telling you what the worth of your website or blog is. Many of us might always be interested to know the monetary value of their website, might be for the purpose of selling it. There are many ways to calculate the worth of any website. It could be a combination of number of incoming links, your Google/Yahoo/Bing rank and back links, your Alexa rank, number of indexed pages in search engines and many more.

Here is the result of my blog worth calculation by different calculator websites.
