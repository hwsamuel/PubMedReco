I have been a fairly steady drinker - 3 to 5 glasses of white wine per evening only. It has been 6 weeks since I have consumed any alcohol and I notice that my blood sugar readings are consistently higher than they were. Does quitting all alcohol lead to higher readings? My diet is the same and no, I'm not going back to booze. research on the internet suggests that red or white wine can reflect in lower blood glucose levels. wggooch@gmail.com
