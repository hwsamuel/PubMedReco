Whether you have quit or are still smoking, how many years have you been smoking? If you've quit, how long did you smoke?

I smoked for about 30 years so it was a really difficult habit to break 8 years ago. I'm really glad I did though because my breathing had started to be a problem....shortness of breath sometimes. In the past 8 years that has gradually diminished and my breathing is fine.

I never smoked but I had relatives who did it for decades. Then, all of a sudden, virtually all my relatives gave up the habit.

I smoked from seventeen until I was thirty nine years old. It took me a couple of attempts before I managed to give it up, but I have and just celebrated my three year anniversary of stopping. I don't think I'd ever be tempted to go back to it, that's for sure.

Good news, ozzie! It's been 4 years for me and I'm so glad that it's behind me once and for all. There's not that feeling of dread and doom over me constantly wondering if I'm giving myself a death sentence now. I'm sure you know the feeling.

I smoked from 16 to 31. I've been smoke free for 5 years. Quitting was one of the hardest things I've EVER done!

It's a good feeling for me when I can see that every month and year that goes by, it goes further and further back in my memory and that's a very good thing.

I smoked ciggies from age 15 to 30. I didn't smoke for the longest time but then I started working graveyard shift at an ER, and everyone smoked there, believe it or not, so I started again and smoked for about two years after that. That's about fifteen years I've been tobacco free.

That's about fifteen years I've been tobacco free. 15 years is great! I've been in those places where everyone else smoked and that is so difficult for someone to be smoke-free in an environment like that. I guess it feels like if you're going to be getting the toxins in the second-hand every day anyhow, why bother quitting?

Hi there! I am new to the board. My name is Sandy and I was a smoker for 10 years and successfully quit 8 years ago! I hope that everyone else has the same success!

I've been smoking for about 10 years and I currently have no intention of quitting. But congrats to those who have. I understand it to be a difficult process for some so good job.

Has to hit home before some will take action... but I'm so glad I stopped when I did... just wish it had been years earlier.

HI Just thought I would update you on my progress for healthy living. I have now been smoke free for 3 months and although I put on a few pounds, I have joined a health club and have lost 7lb To be non smoking and fit is a miracle after all these years of being a smoker. yipee it feels great... All you ex smokers, keep up the good work, but remember, it only took one cig to start smoking in the first place...
