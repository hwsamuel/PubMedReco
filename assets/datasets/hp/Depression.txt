Hello there........Am sick of my anxiety problem and it is really having a toll on my health. I want to get rid of it and now it&#8217;s become unbearable for me. Please help!!! I have browsed the net for solutions and have found some sites which sell pills like xanax for anxiety, depression and all this type of mental health problems. Since the pills cost a good amount I want to know if they really work. Should I go for it or not??? http://st-johns-wort.org/ st johns wort

I would not even bother with the drugs on the internet. These drugs can be dangerous to you, and may make you worse. I would speak to a professional before trying any drugs. You can talk to a doctor and talk to the Dr. about your feelings. It may be helped by not using drugs at all. I have the same problems, and feel like I am alone with these feelings, and going through hell myself, no sleep, headaches all the time. Feel lazy, no energy etc.. Go to depressionhurts.ca and it will give you information on your symptons.
