I have a question for anybody who might have an answer. My sister got pregnant not too long ago, and decided to have an abortion because both she and her boyfriend were unemployed at the time (it's a long story, and besides the point). Now they are in a more stable position, and they have agreed that they want to have a child. The only problem is that it has been only several months since the abortion. About how long should you wait in between an abortion and getting pregnant again?

I thought you could get pregnant pretty much straight away after an abortion and if it has been several months I don't see why they would have to wait?

I think that you can get pregnant right away. I have always heard after any procedure you should wait like six weeks so I really don't see why they couldn't start trying.

Perhaps she should wait until her body has recovered, six weeks, as stated, sounds about right. She might want to make sure that her periods have returned to her normal cycle, which would also demonstrate recovery.

Well, I'm sure that the body needs time to recover, that's why I ask. I recall the doctor saying that she needs to wait several months before she should even have sex again.

You can get pregnant whenever you choose fit. The procedure has nothing to do with your body allowing you to get pregnant.

Standard time after a miscarriage is three months with three normal menses. I would assume you should at least follow those for an abortion as well. She should talk to her OB/GYN before they try to conceive.

If it has been several months, then she should be fine physically. I'd be more concerned with her emotionally/mentally, so as long as they're sure they're completely ready (financially as well), then it should be fine to start trying any time.

I thought you were told to wait a year, but after reading all your posts, I must be thinking of years ago when the procedure was a bit more traumatic.

Yes, I think I remember reading somewhere years ago that when abortions were illegal that you were told to wait a year.

It's probably best to speak to a doctor. I think that it really depends on the person. If after a few months her body has returned to normal and she feels ok, than that should be alright - although if, emotionally, she's not ready it oculd cause stress or emotional pain down the line. Just something to think about. Everyone reacts to the recovery differently.

I had a miscarriage at 16 weeks, then I got pregnant again quite quickly and lost that one too. The doctor said that it may have been because I hadn't left enough time for my body/hormones to settle down, he said about 3 months. I presume the same would apply to the situation you outlined. I hope all goes well for her.

If there were no complications associated with the abortion, she should be able to get pregnant whenever she is ready.

Well, technically you can get pregnant at anytime after an abortion. However, it is suggested you wait a few months before trying again simply to allow your body to heal from the abortion as this can be traumatic for the body. Give it a bit of time, then your body will be healthy and ready to sustain a full term pregnancy. Good luck!

I think there's no specific duration between abortion &amp; new pregnancy Please ask her to visit an obstetrician Good luck
