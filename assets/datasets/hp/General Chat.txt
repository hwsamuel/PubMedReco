Hello All, I recently developed a throat infection that eventually got to my lungs. I went to see the doctor once it got into my lungs because I have a mild case of Asthma and I wanted to be certain it wasn't too serious. I usually like my body to heal itself so I haven't taken the antibiotics that were prescribed yet. I am feeling better and I am sure it will go away on its own now but I'm wondering if me getting better means my body has already developed its own antibodies? If so, can I start taking the antibiotics to speed up the process without my immune system becoming weaker due to antibiotic treatment? From what I know it is supposed to be much better to let your body fight for itself to develop a strong immune system so will me taking the antibiotics now affect my immune system because then I would rather not take them. Let me know what you guys think considering I am feeling much better already. Thanks. Nick.
