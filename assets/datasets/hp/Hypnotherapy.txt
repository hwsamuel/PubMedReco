Do you think a hypnotherapist could help me with sexual urges. I want sex all the time and it drives me nuts. Can't stop thinking about it

I don't know if hypnotherapy works in this application, but surely a counselor would know. I think going and talking it over with a counselor would be a good start.

live, perhaps you would be interested in this [URL=&quot;http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/111398.php&quot;]article[/URL] about a new US website that offers free self-help resources for sex addiction called Recovery Nation. You might find something helpful there.

Technically, I don't know. But I think so that it works.

I agree that it would depend on the professional working on your case. My first impression is that &quot;conscious counseling&quot; would be more valuable than an attempt to use hypnotherapy.

I agree, conscious counseling would be a better option rather than a hypnotherapy.Good luck.
