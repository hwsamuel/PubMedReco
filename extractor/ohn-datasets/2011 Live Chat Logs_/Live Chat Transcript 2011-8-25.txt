Question about MSM...what is the benefit in an implant and what does it do?

13:09:36
deedee
Since the colon is so highly effective at absorbing and sending things right into the blood stream, it is great at transporting things into our system.  MSM would be absorbed effectively into the system and could bypass the digestive system.

13:10:22
Larry
That much I understand, but what does it do for you?

13:11:19
deedee
Oh, MSM is for muscular-skeletal repair and support, plus it is know for repair of the mucosal lining of the digestive system.

13:12:14
Larry
OK...that's good to know.  How often do you recommend using it?

13:13:53
deedee
You can implant as often as you want to, and you can also take it daily orally.

Hmmm....more good-to-know info. FYI, the probiotics and daily enema series really helped while I was on those massive antibiotics.   Everything is now back to normal.

13:16:13
deedee
That is good. Are you feeling pretty back to normal now?

13:17:05
Larry
Other than some lingering soreness in the ankle and a lot of skin that needs to regenerate, all is well.

13:17:55

Just thought of something else.  On an enema series, is it best to use soap in the first or second fill?

13:18:14
deedee
That is good.  Anything else on your mind?

13:22:20
deedee
Do you have any other questions for me Larry?  Have you watched all of our new videos yet?

13:23:00
Larry
Just the question above on &quot;soap&quot; and I'm not sure if I've checked all the videos.

13:27:39
deedee
OK, what about the soap?

13:28:05
Larry
Is it best to use in the first or second fill of an enema series?

13:30:01
deedee
We like it on the first one because it gives you a chance to rinse out after.

13:31:10
Larry
Good enough.  That's all I have.  Thanks for answering my questions.  Guess I'll go mow the lawn, clean my fishing gear, and maybe take a nap!! LOL

Sounds more fun than what I have planned!  See you next time.
