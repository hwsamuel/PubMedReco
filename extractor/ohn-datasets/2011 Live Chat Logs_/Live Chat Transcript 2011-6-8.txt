Hello folks. Thanks for joining me tonight. Feel free to share your stories, ask questions, etc.

Hi Kristina!

20:02:02
Alan D
Hello all.

20:02:15
randyu
How are you Kristina?

20:02:35
kristina
First, I want to announce we have posted 6 new short videos on YouTube which address health.

20:02:37
randyu
:) 

20:02:42
kristina
I am great. Thanks for asking.

20:03:01
randyu
What are the youtube videos about?

20:03:40

Dave
DeeDee mentioned at the last chat that OHC is seeing increasing requests for enemas vs. colonics. Is this a reflection of the economy or just a return to a once-popular home remedy?

20:04:44
kristina
Over the next few days, we will put up at least two more.

20:05:15
randyu
Dave, it is both, I think.

20:05:50
kristina
Good question, Dave. But, truthfully I don't know.  I think it is both.

20:08:19
Dave
I suspect both too, but I guess they didn't explain. Both for me too.

20:08:29
randyu
Kristina, is there no cure for IBS?  What about the new meds?

20:11:26
kristina
Scientific inquiry delving deeper into digestive diseases like IBS is excellent, but I don't think, from what I have seen so far, that there will be medications that improve upon what dietary controls and herbs can do.

20:11:44
kristina
I do address this issue in our new echinacea video that is now on YouTube.

20:11:52
Scott
It seems that there has been a resurgence of enema use relative to cleansing regimens over the last few years. 

20:12:08
kristina
Can you share what drugs you are referring to?

20:12:20
Dan K
I agree that enema therapy is much more acceptable now than it has been in a long time!

20:12:33
kristina
Enemas are indeed an excellent tool to use to assist the body to cleanse. 

20:12:36
randyu
Anti-spasm drugs like donnatal, bentyl, etc.

20:13:12
kristina
The OHN has certainly helped to bring that awareness to more and more people.

20:13:30
Dan K
Yes, you surely have done that.

20:14:21
randyu
Enemas do help IBS symptoms also.  They help cleanse and relieve constipation as well.

20:14:44
kristina
I think that if there is a cause for the digestive tract to be in spasm, the best tool is to stop triggering the spasm.

20:14:57
Dan K
No doubt about that, especially if you're using a high-pH solution in your colon.

20:15:15
Scott
Perhaps our elders knew more than we gave them credit for. I agree that OHN has been tremendous in shining a positive light on these ancient techniques that can be simple to use.

20:15:19
kristina
Randy, can you talk about how enemas have helped you?

20:15:22
randyu
What triggers spasm?

20:16:34
Dan K
I believe that excess acidity in the body CAN trigger colon spasms.

20:17:11
joan
I'm pretty new to home enemas.  It seems to take me hours to boil the water, then cool the water, then administer the enema.

20:17:27
joan
Any tips on speeding up the process?

20:17:38
randyu
Yes, the enemas have helped keep the colon clean and things moving more normal.  So far, I can only take in about one pint of fluid at a time.  Why?

20:17:41
kristina
Different things cause irritation to the gut for different people. The list includes gluten, stress hormones, various elements in dairy, perservatives, pollutants, the &quot;wrong&quot; type of bacteria...

20:17:49
Scott
There is that old country doctor from Minnesota that wrote extensively about enema use to address many digestive problems.

20:17:50
Dan K
I am fortunate enough to live in an area where water quality is high.

20:17:54
Dave
Drug stores seem to be behind the curve on the resurgence of classical enemas, with little or no equipment. OHN helps fill the need.

20:18:07
kristina
Get a filter, like our shower filter, so that you don't have to boil the water.

20:18:09
Dan K
All I have to do is to adjust the temperature of the water for my enemas.

20:18:22
kristina
Welcome, Joan.

20:18:28
randyu
It helps if you have someone help give you the enema, if that is possible.  

20:18:30
kristina
Glad to have you here. 

20:18:47
Dan K
Yes, almost any kind of a caring partner can help with the enemas.

20:18:58
kristina
Would that work for you, Joan, so that you don't feel that you have to boil the water?

20:19:53
joan
Thanks... I'll look at your filter.  I have well water and someone told me to boil the water.

20:19:55
Scott
To the the extent that IBS includes a plethora of digestive issues, I can keep my IBS in check with varying enema solutions depending on the symptoms

20:20:10
Dan K
Uh huh.

20:20:48
Dan K
The main additives seem to be soapy solution, baking soda solution, Epsom salt solutions, and coffee enemas - modified as to their acidity.

20:21:38
Scott
Finding enema providers in this area is nearly impossible. It would be great to be in closer proximity to OHN.

20:22:02
joan
I seem to have a real hard time holding any water with castille soap, so I've only used vinegar occasionally or sea salt.

20:22:28
randyu
Yes, same here.  Not many providers. You would think primary care doctors would want to do this as a service.

20:22:29
Dan K
Vinegar by rectum is EXCESSIVELY acidic.

20:22:44
Dan K
Hello Cristina.

20:22:48
cristinag
Hi.

20:23:01
Dan K
Hi Cristina. 

20:23:33
cristinag
I have seen images of tangled colons. Is there any way to untangle them?

20:23:43
kristina
I haven't heard of using vinegars in the enema. Can you tell me why you would use vinegar?

20:23:54
Scott
I only use soap solution when the laxative effect is necessary for constipation. More soothing solutions allow me to use higher volumes.

20:24:18
randyu
I just use plain water, room temp.

20:24:25
kristina
The proper amount of sea salt in a warm enema seems to be the easiest to hold for the most people.

20:25:08
Dan K
Well, yes, Kristina.

20:25:10
joan
Donna Gates from Body Ecology recommends apple cider vinegar in the enema... so I've been adding it.

20:25:14
kristina
Also, you might watch our two downloadable videos shorts, Small Volume and Large Volume Enema, as taking the water VERY slowly can be crucial for being able to take in 1-4 quarts of water during an enema.

20:25:49
Dan K
but when the body acidity goes LOW, meaning pH has gone low, the body becomes more susceptible to opportunistic illness.

20:26:24
Scott
Those two videos are well done.

20:26:34
kristina
You can encourage your colon therapists to call OHN and we can send them a PowerPoint presentation on the importance of helping their clients with in-home enema therapy.

20:26:44
Dan K
Oh wow.

20:26:48
Dan K
I shall surely do that.

20:27:03
randyu
There again, having someone administer the enema is the key to getting it done right, with the proper slow speed and volume, etc.

20:27:18
Dan K
AND relaxation during the procedure.

20:27:42
randyu
Can I get the PowerPoint to use myself?  

20:27:58
kristina
Thank you, Scott. Also, what other solutions do you use to what effect?

20:28:21
Scott
It certainly makes the process more relaxing especially when stress relief is desired.

20:28:31
Dan K
Uh huh.

20:28:57
randyu
Yes, true, relaxation is the key to success.

20:29:20
Dan K
Full distention + long retention = better success ratios

20:29:29
Scott
I will use a salt and soda solution to address cramping, indigestion, gas, or even diarrhea as needed.

20:29:53
Dan K
Why the salt, Scott ?

20:29:55
randyu
Soda?  coke or what?

20:30:05
joan
Baking soda?

20:30:32
kristina
OK, that makes sense now, Joan. She must have added that suggestion to her protocols in the last few years, as I haven't been fully keeping up with her thinking on health.

20:30:42
Scott
A local clerk even suggested chlorophyll although I didn't realize any noticeable benefit.

20:30:43
Dan K
Yes, Joan, ordinary, kitchen-cooking-quality baking soda.

20:31:18
kristina
Joan, can you tell us about your experiences with using the vinegar? How much do you use?

20:31:24
randyu
OK, baking soda...

20:31:28
Dan K
Many people try for ONE level tablespoon of baking soda per quart of enema solution.

20:31:33
kristina
Do you know any positive effect with the vinegar enemas?

20:32:04
kristina
It is thought that a vinegar enema will increase the acidity of the colon.

20:32:20
Dan K
Most assuredly it does, Kristina

20:32:25
Dan K
and THAT is not helpful.

20:32:26
joan
I use 2-3 Tbsp in my 4-quart bag.  I haven't really figured out it if helps or not.

20:32:47
Scott
The sea salt and baking soda solution, in the proper ratio, limits fluid shifts in the colon, so I've been told.

20:33:12
Dan K
What &quot;shifts&quot; are you worried about, Scott?

20:33:57
Dan K
Hello Herk.

20:34:16
kristina
I think chlorophyll in the enema solution can be very helpful.

20:34:27
randyu
Why not just plain water?

20:34:29
Scott
I don't want to trigger any extreme reactions in renal function... or exacerbate dehydration issues.

20:34:31
Dan K
Yes, that's true, Kristina.

20:34:42
kristina
I also recommend taking it orally a couple of hours before you take the enema.

20:34:54
Dan K
Plain water can dilute the blood, without giving any real value to the procedure.

20:35:10
kristina
I appreciate everyone's opinions and experience and expertise, just in case anyone is wondering.

20:35:18
Dan K
lol

20:35:22
Dan K
Thank you, dear.

20:35:29
randyu
What do you mean dilute the blood, Kristina?

20:35:34
Dave
An elderly, now-retired colon therapist recommended a couple ounces of organic cider vinegar  with the &quot;mother&quot; or solids in a bag. Said she did that with her own enemas.

20:35:53
kristina
Dan, can you further explain why you think increasing the acidity of the colon is not helpful?

20:36:04
Dan K
Not increasing acidity.

20:36:10
joan
What do you think of adding Epsom salts?

20:36:15
Dan K
Increasing the alkalinity

20:36:29
cristinag
I have done coffee enemas. Are they too acidic?

20:36:40
kristina
I got it. I am just wondering if you might explain your thinking.

20:37:05
kristina
It is important that you use a low-acid coffee, which is the type of coffee that we offer at the Optimal Health Network.

20:37:10
Dan K
which strenghens the innate immune system, fighting off the opportunistic illness which otherwise gets a free reign in producing illnesses of all sorts.

20:37:20
Alan D
I tool Epsom salts once orally to see what it would do. Wow, did it ever work good for me.

20:37:23
randyu
Why would plain water enemas dilute the blood?

20:37:29
Scott
For those of us that have relied on or used enemas for decades, it is critical that we cause no further harm than the nuisance ailments we sometimes suffer.

20:37:30
Dan K
It made you poop, eh?

20:37:40
Dan K
Exactly, and therefore we want to INCREASE alkalinity in the blood.

20:37:53
Alan D
Oh yes, for 3 days on one dose.

20:38:21
Dan K
See? Even cancer is an &quot;opportunistic&quot; illness.

20:38:39
Scott
Forums like this help us develop or confirm our understanding of various issues.

20:38:47
kristina
If I am missing anything, please write it again.

20:38:47
Dan K
Exactly

20:38:55
Dan K
which is why I like to hear from you others.

20:39:12
kristina
Ideally, the pH of the colon stays between 5.5 and 7, slightly acidic to neutral.

20:39:21
Dan K
Uhhhhh.

20:39:24
randyu
What's wrong with just plain water?

20:39:43
Dan K
6.0 to about 6.9, according to what's-his-name.

20:40:20
Dan K
Otto Warburg showed that one cannot even &quot;get&quot; cancer, unless and until the body pH has gone below 5.9, and that was in 1930s.

20:41:00
kristina
Apple cider vinegar is usually around 2.8 to 3.

20:41:03
Scott
I've used plain old tap water for more than fifty years... with a different solution on various occasions to address specific needs.

20:41:15
kristina
I do think taking apple cider vinegar orally is a great idea

20:41:15
Dan K
Warburg was only one of two men to ever win the Nobel Prize in Medicine TWO TIMES.

20:41:35
Dan K
Oral ACV is good, Kristina.

20:41:39
Dan K
You're right on with that.

20:41:41
kristina
in small amount.

20:41:43
Scott
I agree on the oral consumption of vinegar.

20:41:45
Dan K
Yeppers.

20:41:45
randyu
Tap water is fine if it is good.

20:41:50
Dan K
Yeppers.

20:41:52
Alan D
How often, Kristina?

20:44:00
kristina
I would love to hear from Donna Gates and I do know that ACV has anti-fungal, anti-bacterial, and anti-viral properties. 

20:44:12
Dan K
All are true

20:44:19
Dan K
but sometimes not enough.

20:44:33
Dan K
Not enough &quot;oomph&quot; to eliminate stubborn illnesses

20:44:38
Alan D
Right now I am taking Miralax 3 times a day and only move every day or two.

20:44:42
Dan K
such as interstitial cystitis.

20:45:06
Scott
That sounds horrible, Alan.

20:45:10
Dan K
Alan, why take something at the top when the relief you seek is at the bottom?

20:45:28
kristina
It seems we have tornado sirens going off here. I think I need to close for now so I can think more fully about what is happening with the weather.

20:45:53
Scott
Best of luck!

20:45:58
Dan K
Thank you

20:45:59
Dan K
so much.

20:46:18
kristina
Please call or e-mail us with any further issues or conversations, and please take some time to read my blog and watch the YouTube videos.

20:46:32
randyu
Dan K, you are right. The bottom is where the relief is needed.

20:46:37
kristina
Please spread it all around on your Facebook pages, and other social media tools, if you would be so kind.

20:46:40
Dave
Will do. Be safe.

20:46:45
kristina
It really helps us out, a lot.

20:46:59
Dan K
Thank YOU.

20:47:06
randyu
Thanks.

20:47:09
Dan K
A day late and a dollar short, as usual.

20:47:18
Alan D
I have real bad hemorrhoids and anal fissures. I cannot insert a nozzle right now.

20:47:28
Dan K
Ahhhh.

20:47:34
Dan K
There are ways around that.

20:47:45
Scott
Have you tried a soft rubber catheter?

20:48:04
Dan K
My fiancee has the same disability

20:48:35
Dan K
and a very slim catheter seems to be OK, for her, if we slip it in very slowly.

20:48:36
Alan D
No, just a regular nozzle.

20:48:59
Alan D
How small?

20:49:18
Dan K
Alan, are you taking any vitamin D3, and/or any vitamin C ?

20:49:32
Dan K
Size 14, I think.

20:49:58
Dan K
14 Fr.

20:49:58
Alan D
Yes, both... My problems are from large amounts of narcotic meds for a back injury.

20:50:04
cristinag
The catheters work very well. I use a silicone catheter because the water would slip out because of my hemmorhoids blocking the way.

20:50:04
Dan K
Uh-huh.

20:50:05
Alan D
OK.

20:50:10
Dan K
Her EXACT situation, as well.

20:50:31
Alan D
Wow, small world.

20:50:38
Alan D
80mg oxy here.

20:50:42
Dan K
Sad world, too.

20:50:54
Dan K
She gets by, on less

20:50:59
Dan K
but she hurts too.

20:51:06
Scott
Good night all!

20:51:18
Dan K
I try to be real gentle when slipping the Fr. catheter into her.

20:51:30
randyu
Good night, all...

20:51:30
Dave
Bye all.

20:51:36
Dan K
Bye Dave.

20:52:11
Dan K
How long have any of the rest of you relied on enema therapy for good health?

20:52:42
cristinag
About 4 years.

20:52:51
Dan K
Uh huh.

20:52:59
Dan K
Any regrets about using enema therapy?

20:53:16
cristinag
Not at all.

20:53:24
Dan K
In my case, I was started on enemas by my mom, bless her soul, when I was just an infant

20:53:35
cristinag
Wow.

20:53:47
Dan K
on the advice of our family pediatrician.

20:54:21
cristinag
How often do you do it?

20:54:40
Dan K
I was 42 years old, when I was finally diagnosed as having had &quot;congenital redundant colon&quot; by actual barium enema inspection.

20:54:50
Alan D
Thanks all.

20:55:05
Dan K
Today, I am glad I can get an enema, every day of the week.

20:55:30
Dan K
I KNOW they keep me healthy, and well

20:55:36
Dan K
at my age 60.

20:56:07
cristinag
So your body never cues with natural peristalsis?

20:56:20
Dan K
Cristina, do you have any doubts about using enemas, for yourself?

20:56:27
Dan K
No, not really.

20:57:00
Dan K
If I don't use the enemas, it takes about five days for me to even have a sensation akin to needing to evacuate my bowels.

20:57:37
Dan K
Herk, don't be shy -- jump in, any time.

20:57:39
cristinag
Wow, I can't imagine what that's like.

20:58:19
Dan K
The only real time it was difficult was when I was in college, with a lack of privacy in the boys' dorm.

20:58:43
cristinag
Aren't you washing away all your good bacteria every day?

20:58:51
Dan K
No, I am quite sure of that.

20:59:04
Dan K
There are billions and billions of those bacteria in my colon

20:59:18
Dan K
and I actually think I am giving them a better environment

20:59:34
Dan K
when I clean out the &quot;bad stuff.&quot;

21:00:20
cristinag
What time of day do you do it,? Before breakfast? After dinner?

21:00:43
Dan K
Most usually, first thing in the morning.

21:03:04
Dan K
Some of us simply benefit more from a good enema, than from any other medical therapy.

21:03:19
Dan K
No aches or pains.

21:03:23
Dan K
No illnesses.

21:03:32
Dan K
No other pill poppin' other than vitamins

21:03:47
Dan K
and all I invest is about 1/2 an hour, early in the mornings.

21:03:55
cristinag
Wow, that's something to admire!

21:04:01
Dan K
Thank you.

21:06:37
cristinag
It was when we first started learning about enemas and we went to a hydrotherapy place. Then I realized that it was too expensive and decided to do it at home.

21:08:24
cristinag
I have used coffee and chlorophyll along with acidophilus powder.

21:08:30
Dan K
Those are good additives.
