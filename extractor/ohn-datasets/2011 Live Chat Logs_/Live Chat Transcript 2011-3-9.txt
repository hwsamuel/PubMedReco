DeeDee will always be attending the noon chat the 4th Wednesday of the month.

20:02:58
kristina
Please go ahead and ask your questions or make your comments as you are moved. 

20:03:22
MladyM
Is there such thing as gut fermentation?

20:03:35
michael b
So what is new that you want to share with us?

20:04:02
kristina
I think so.

20:04:47
kristina
Can you tell me why you ask?

20:04:53
MladyM
My breath gives off these foul odors and no doctor has been able to find out the problem

20:05:03
kristina
I want to advance the idea of autoimmunity during tonight's live chat.

20:05:17
kristina
However, please bring up the topics on your mind, too.

20:06:37
MladyM
Can you offer any suggestions on this matter?

20:07:26
kristina
As I hinted at in my most recent blog post entitled Poisoned into Deep Peace, autoimmunity plays a role in many health issues. However, self-recognition by the immune system is a normal daily function.

20:07:44
kristina
Can you give me a list of the foods that you ate today?

20:07:56
Brett
I've been dealing with mold/mildew in my bathroom for a while now.  I want to continue my enemas, but I'm concerned about this.  I don't want mildew growing in my enema bag.  Any ideas?

20:08:09
Dave
Is this part 4 in the blogs area?

20:09:10
MladyM
Fruit for breakfast, potatoes for a mid-morning snack, vegetable soup for lunch, chicken wrap for dinner.

20:10:29
MladyM
I took a mushroom extract pill to try and stop the odor and gas, and I think that made things worst.

20:10:36
kristina
You need to get rid of the mold in your bathroom.

20:10:41
kristina
Do you know how to do that?

20:11:05
kristina
Do you eat wheat?

20:11:52
MladyM
Yes, and I did try to stop, and the odor still seems to be expelled though my lungs.

20:12:15
kristina
What are commonly known autoimmune health issues?

20:12:22
kristina
Diabetes Mellitus Type 1

20:12:28
kristina
Celiac Disease

20:12:55
michael b
A molotov cocktail will stop mold forever.

20:12:55
kristina
Rheumatoid Arthritis

20:13:06
Brett
The problem is that I live in an apartment and the bathroom does not have very good air circulation, even with the fan.  I've tried several cleaners which have helped, but the mildew remains, especially on the shower curtain.

20:13:12
kristina
lol

20:13:34
kristina
Can you get a new shower curtain?

20:13:59
Brett
I did.  One with a mildew-resistant coating.  Still came back.

20:14:10
kristina
Also, you can store your enema bag in another room or closet outside of the bathroom, but you still do want to rid the bathroom of the mold.

20:14:17
kristina
Yikes!

20:14:58
Brett
Yea.  We had our air ducts cleaned a few months back - the first time it had ever been done.  Mold was found in the ducts.

20:15:19
kristina
Maybe you need to move?

20:15:38
Brett
Unfortunately, not an option.

20:15:42
Dave
I think metal enema cans were once popular because of the ease in cleaning, guarding against mold/mildew.

20:15:54
Brett
I've thought of that.

20:15:59
kristina
We offer Thieves Essential Oil and Thieves Cleaner, which work for some.

20:16:24
Brett
Are there any metal cans that are 4 qts?  That's the size of my bag now.

20:16:29
kristina
Grapefruit seed extract also works for some.

20:16:38
kristina
Do you wipe down the surfaces daily?

20:16:39
Brett
Some what?

20:16:52
Dave
OHN has the buckets.

20:17:20
MladyM
Is this not supposed to be centered around the colon or did I miss something?

20:17:37
Brett
I wipe down the sink and let the shower air dry.

20:17:51
Brett
Sorry.  In a way it is.

20:18:08
Brett
I don't want to do enemas if I can't do them in a clean environment.

20:18:20
michael b
I think there are industrial grade moisture absorbents?

20:18:42
kristina
Yes, we offer the only 4-quart enema bucket available on the market. It is high-quality, stainless steel, all welds are continuous, barbed hose drain, vertical sliding handle with center-formed V, no wall bracket, standard 5/16&quot; spout for enema hose, locally made in Wisconsin, 60% recycled material.

20:18:49
Brett
Kristina, what were those cleaners you mentioned?

20:19:09
MladyM
What's a good fruit to eat in the morning for breakfast that won't cause too much gas?

20:19:10
Brett
Hmm. How much?

20:19:16
kristina
The topic is what people need it to be related to health, colon cleansing, enema equipment, etc.

20:19:53
kristina
No, the blog post Poisoned into Deep Peace is not the 4th in the series entitled Golden Arches.

20:20:22
kristina
I recommend wiping down the surfaces once a day for awhile with either Thieves or GSE.

20:21:09
razoriowa
GSE works well diluted in water for anti-mold campaign.

20:22:04
Brett
How should I use it?

20:22:35
kristina
You can wipe it on the surface undiluted until the problem is gone

20:22:47
kristina
or you can dilute it as per the directions.

20:23:01
razoriowa
Wear your gloves if you use it straight - hard on fingernails.

20:23:42
kristina
Autoimmunity is when the body fails to recognize its own parts as self, which results in an immune response against its own cells and tissues.

20:24:09
kristina
So, any disease that results from an aberrant immune response is termed autoimmune disease.

20:24:10
Brett
Thanks.

20:24:47
razoriowa
The GSE is very concentrated. I normally dilute mine per instructions

20:25:47
Brett
Hmm. Looks like GSE is currently out of stock.

20:25:48
kristina
I will explore how and why this happens - why I think many diseases that aren't traditionally thought of as autoimmune may actually be autoimmune diseases, such as asthma, and what we can do about diseases of autoimmunity.

20:25:58
kristina
I will go change that right now!

20:26:24
Brett
Interesting.  So, you think asthma is an autoimmune disease?

20:27:58
kristina
Yes, I do.

20:28:07
kristina
GSE is now in stock.

20:28:23
Brett
Thanks.

20:28:43
Brett
I never thought of that.  My brother and niece suffer from asthma.

20:29:09
Brett
I've always wondered if there was a way to help them besides with medication.

20:30:31
Brett
What oils do you recommend as additions to an enema?

20:30:45
kristina
A lot of thinking in the past has focused on how does autoimmune disease arise where, in fact, the immune system is suddenly recognizing self where, in fact, the immune system is constantly recognizing self.

20:31:57
kristina
The question that we should instead ask is: how is it that the control on this self-recognition is lost?

20:32:23
kristina
And how is it that this loss of control then results in tissue destruction?

20:32:54
kristina
Absolutely there are ways to help your brother and niece with their asthma, without medication.

20:33:06
kristina
Essential oils in the enema....

20:33:45
Brett
Any that are good &quot;defaults&quot;?

20:33:49
kristina
The easiest answer is to call DeeDee and ask her because she is helping people to create custom blends that best fit your physiological needs.

20:34:15
kristina
Peppermint, Lemongrass, Fennel, JuvaFlex

20:34:28
michael b
I have read that if you move from thousands of miles away to a new home, you become more prone to illnesses that native folks became immune to as they grew up.

20:34:39
kristina
JuvaFlex is the one I would start with.

20:35:00
kristina
That makes sense.

20:35:23
Brett
Why that one?  I've never heard of it.

20:36:40
kristina
JuvaFlex is fennel, geranium, rosemary, roman chamomile, blue tansy, and helichrysum. 

20:37:46
kristina
These ingredients have been studied for their supportive effects on the liver and the digestive and lympathic systems. As far as I am concerned, it is a perfect blend for use in the colon.

20:38:13
michael b
That is quite a mix. Does OHN sell such?

20:38:15
Dave
It's delivered via enema I assume?

20:38:19
kristina
Yes, we do.

20:39:16
kristina
Yes, deliver the JuvaFlex via the enema. You can add it to the last enema in the series and even hold it for some hours. You can also implant it with some olive oil. You can also just use it in your cleansing enema water.

20:39:25
kristina
Welcome, Jim.

20:40:53
kristina
Have I missed any questions or comments?

20:42:13
kristina
It is true that certain individuals are genetically susceptible to developing autoimmune diseases.

20:42:55
kristina
However, genetically predisposed individuals do not always develop autoimmune diseases.

20:46:30
kristina
I want to propose that it in order to have a sustain autoimmune response you need to have a state of hyper-reactivity in the immune system so that the immune system is more charged, more easily triggered into a self-sustaining, continous response.

20:47:20
Brett
Have you thought about doing research on this?

20:48:33
Brett
I'd bet many would welcome your results and insight.

20:49:08
Brett
You've already brought up several good question about the subject just tonight.

20:49:39
kristina
DeeDee and I have been studying with Kerry Bone from Australia and he has put together the research, which I am working on weaving into the literature that we offer on our website as it is an important concept to understand.

20:49:47
kristina
Thank you, Brett.

20:49:58
michael b
I have been following your advice for over 5 years now, and I think it is paying off, more so than could have imagined.

20:50:00
kristina
What questions do you have?

20:50:10
Brett
Cool.

20:50:22
kristina
Wow! Thank you, Michael. Please feel free to share any details.

20:51:02
kristina
It is a joy to assist you with aging gracefully for many years to come.

20:51:53
Brett
Is it possible to repair an enema bag?

20:53:04
kristina
Concepts to look for around autoimmunity, as we are running out of time: primary lesions, molecular mimicry, how microbes escape detection from the human immune system, tissue markers, host tissue, cross reaction...

20:53:47
Brett
The hour is almost gone?  Wow!  We could use two hours.  ;-)

20:54:15
Brett
:) 

20:54:59
kristina
Antibodies to viruses can cross react with uninfected host cells.

20:55:34
kristina
When someone gets an infection, they often temporarily produce auto antibodies.

20:55:41
Brett
Sounds like autoimmunity can get complicated.

20:55:50
kristina
Yes.

20:56:05
kristina
But we will make it easy to understand and to understand its importance to all of us.

20:56:39
kristina
Next Live Chat: Wednesday, March 23rd at noon

20:57:45
kristina
Central Time.

20:58:33
Brett
Good night.  Thanks again for the GSE tips.

20:58:46
kristina
You are very welcome. Good night to everyone!

20:58:54
kristina
And thanks for joining me tonight.
