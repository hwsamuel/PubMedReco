Hi

13:01:40
Larry
Sparse crowd today?

13:02:52
DeeDee
Welcome everyone!  Sorry I am late.  I had signing in difficulties today.

13:03:13
DeeDee
Any questions or topics of interest today?

13:03:20
Dave
You're forgiven, lol

13:03:27
Larry
Still awaiting my HTMA report.  Hoped it would be here today but no luck.

13:03:28
DeeDee
Thank you! 

13:03:54
Larry
Essential oils / hypothyroidism?

13:04:06
DeeDee
I am sorry that is late, Larry.  I would think it would have gotten to you by now.

13:05:00
Larry
It is over an hour away!! LOL

13:05:07
Dave
Re my e-mail of May 1, regarding getting on schedule after colonic/thorough enema series: my local therapist also recommended senna, in tea form, and seems to work well.

13:06:05
Dave
Maybe your advice would helpful to others here.

13:06:16
DeeDee
Some oils for hypothyroidism are lemongrass, spearmint myrtle, peppermint, clove and myrrh.

13:06:53
Larry
Good... Some of those are in the blend you made for me.

13:08:02
DeeDee
Senna can work very well, but like other herbs, it can lose its effectiveness if used regularly and then you need to take a break from it.

13:08:38
DeeDee
I am glad we got those oils in the blend!

13:09:33
Larry
The suppository trick with coconut oil is GREAT.  So easy to use and seems to be working very well. Thanks!

13:09:43
Dave
I only expect to use it monthly or a week or so less.

13:09:50
DeeDee
Some other herbs that can be beneficial to get the colon working well and you can use them ongoing are chamomile and meadowsweat, fenugreek.

13:10:18
Dave
Just as a restarter for me.

13:10:19
DeeDee
That is great that the senna works to get you on track and that you do not need to use it regularly.

13:10:48
DeeDee
I am loving those suppositories also!  I am starting to use them more here with people too after their sessions.

13:11:38
DeeDee
They stay in well, are comfortable, and absorb into the system quickly.

13:11:43
DeeDee
Welcome Joseph.

13:12:13
Dave
I do use other herbs as needed because I'm on dehydrating meds.

13:12:16
Larry
Those Walmart tube trays are working nicely.

13:12:40
Joseph
Hello DeeDee, all.

13:13:26
DeeDee
That is great, Larry.  I bought some more of the kind of trays I found also because people are asking for them.

13:14:25
DeeDee
Joseph, any topics to discuss?

13:15:30
Larry
DeeDee... I want to thank you again for making my session so relaxing and making me feel comfortable.  I learned a ton from you.

13:16:04
DeeDee
I have more and more people trying enemas than before.  Usually, the majority has been colonics, but lately, a lot of enemas.

13:16:15
DeeDee
You are so welcome Larry!

13:16:39
DeeDee
Larry, how have you been doing at home with your sessions?

13:17:00
Dave
Ditto for that, Larry.

13:17:07
DeeDee
Thank you Dave!

13:17:28
Joseph
Well DeeDee, I know I brought this up last session, but I tried a nice series with the silicone colon tube and could not get that darn tube in very far yesterday. I started a flow to try and make it easier, to no avail.

13:18:42
Larry
Very good... My time frame for a 3-enema series runs about 90 minutes or a bit more and uses all 4 quarts if I keep it slow.  I'm really anxious to see my report so I can fine-tune the solutions and implants.

13:18:47
DeeDee
Joseph, are you close enough to come in?  or have you viewed our DVD on colon tubes?

13:19:21
Dave
Maybe we are coming full circle with enema use... Very popular home remedy in some of our childhoods, and economical too.

13:19:55
Joseph
I am in Chicago, pretty close for a weekend trip, and I haven't been able to see the colon tube DVD.

13:20:04
Larry
I highly recommend a session w/ DeeDee for pure learning and help.

13:20:57
Larry
BTW... come a bit early and try out the massage chair!

13:21:53
DeeDee
I have a client who has brought in a hand mirror and he holds it so he can watch me insert the colon tube and get an idea of how I do it.

13:21:53
Joseph
I visited once before. Had the luxury to use the infrared sauna before therapy.

13:22:48
Joseph
Since it is silicone, what type of lubrication should I use? I hear KY is no good for silicone.

13:22:57
DeeDee
I have had an occasional problem with some people where the colon tube just won't go in because they have a twist or pronounced curve; it would just be unsafe to try and get through.

13:23:11
DeeDee
The sauna is awesome, isn't it?

13:23:18
Joseph
Yes it was!

13:23:33
Joseph
...so I've been using the coconut oil.

13:24:05
DeeDee
I use our surgilube which is similar to KY, without the chemical additives, but you could use coconut oil or olive oil also.

13:24:35
Joseph
Okay, thank you, DeeDee.

13:26:06
Dave
I had a now-retired therapist who did a first-time check of the rectum because she said curvature differed among people and she wanted correct insertion of the speculum.

13:26:40
Larry
I've found a local source for massage of the lymph nodes.  Should I do a cleansing series before or after the massage?

13:28:30
DeeDee
I was taught in colon therapy school in Chicago to check the rectum also for angle, etc., but I-ACT frowns upon that.  We are not supposed to stick our finger into any orifice unless we are MDs. Most of the problems with the colon tubes occur further up.

13:29:16
DeeDee
You could do a cleanse after your massage to help the body flush out what the massage therapist does.  Drink plenty of water also.

13:30:32
Dave
The therapist was an old-timer (80 plus), so she followed her own rules, lol. 

13:31:15
DeeDee
Yes, older therapists did do their own thing  - better off I am sure!

13:32:44
DeeDee
In our newsletter coming up in a few days,  Kristina talks about Madison being one of the most polluted cities, so cleansing is so important!

13:32:54
Larry
One of my major issues is cramping after heavy workouts or long cycling trips.  My endocronologist has me a heavy doses of magnesium which I want to stop.  Since this is likely a thyroid issue, is there a specific essential oil I can try?

13:33:01
Dave
She was careful. Offered sterilized metal speculum, but mostly did disposables as requested.

13:33:42
DeeDee
Larry, where are you getting the cramps?

13:34:20
Larry
Hamstrings, neck, calves, glutes, hands.

13:35:52
DeeDee
Panaway can be used topically   internally (suppository). You could use wintergreen, rosemary, fennel, marjoram, basil, nutmeg -  a good blend of these.

13:36:27
DeeDee
Larry, it will be interesting to see your magnesium levels on your hair analysis also.

13:36:59
Larry
Yup, that and the lead level.

13:37:09
Dave
Would have thought that with capital and university and enviro activists, city would be purer.

13:37:50
Larry
It's from all of the oil those cyclists are using on their chains!! lol

13:37:51
DeeDee
Calcium/potassium ratios have to do with the thyroid on the test.

13:38:15
DeeDee
Welcome, Ruri.

13:38:47
Ruri P
Thank you, good to be here - sorry to be late though.

13:38:48
DeeDee
I guess there are a few factories, etc., around here generating stuff.

13:39:30
DeeDee
Ruri, any questions, comments, subjects?

13:39:38
Dave
Meat and cheese, I suspect!

13:39:55
DeeDee
That could be!

13:40:03
Joseph
yep, sausage and cheese!

13:40:24
Dave
Good or bad, DeeDee?

13:41:11
Ruri P
Actually, I was wondering if there is a safe way to use enemas to contribute to weight loss; also, I'm concerned about heavy metal poisoning (my mom has a severe case) and was wondering how to use enemas to help with that as well.

13:42:49
DeeDee
Ruri, enemas can definitely be used for weight loss and heavy metal detox.  To get a more specific plan, we should talk, and for the heavy metals, we should do a hair tissue mineral analysis so we know what we are looking at.

13:43:42
DeeDee
There are essential oils for the enema, and supplements that you could take along with a cleansing program to deal with both of those issues.  I would want to get a health history so I could recommend accurately.

13:44:24
Ruri P
Well, my mom has taken a heavy metals hair test.

13:44:46
Ruri P
That is why I asked, but it would be nice to get your  thoughts.

13:44:47
DeeDee
A good oral and colon cleanse that supports the liver and colon and works on diet would probably be a good combination.

13:44:58
DeeDee
Welcome, Mike.

13:45:39
DeeDee
I would definitely want to take a look at the test and get a health history, but enemas can be a very good tool in dealing with this.

13:46:15
Ruri P
How do I contact you?

13:46:43
DeeDee
You can call the office  608-242-0200 or e-mail me at   deedee@[ourdomain].com.

13:47:01
Ruri P
Thanks so much and I have one more question.

13:47:06
DeeDee
We could then set up a good protocol for both of you.

13:47:27
DeeDee
Sure, go ahead and ask anything.

13:47:56
DeeDee
Mike, any questions or issues?

13:48:35
Dave
Any reason given by clients for new enema interest?

13:48:58
DeeDee
Ruri, coffee enemas would probably be a good thing for both of you also.

13:49:25
Ruri P
I was studying Chinese medicine for a while and I learned that the matter is looked over after bowel movements.

13:49:37
mike s
I'm a bit new to this but what should I avoid eating before an enema and what time frame?

13:49:51
DeeDee
Dave, no reason given, but several people expressed learning for home usage also.

13:50:19
Ruri P
Would you say that one should study what has happened after your enema? Like what comes out of the body? 

13:51:16
Larry
Dave... for me it was the high cost of colonics vs. home enema series.  I wanted to learn the proper way to do everything and what equipment to use.  Sooo much better than just watching a video!

13:51:23
DeeDee
Mike, I always advise to try to stay away from foods that may cause you gas the day before and the day of.

13:51:25
Dave
Thanks. Guess it's a new thing for much/most of the population.

13:51:30
DeeDee
Some people do fast the day of their cleanse, but others do not feel well when they do this, so you can eat a light meal a couple hours before the cleanse.

13:52:14
DeeDee
That is what many are doing too, Larry.  It makes sense especially for those who cannot find a good therapist in their area also.

13:52:46
Ruri P
Both of us do coffee enemas but Ii was thinking of doing the soap. I did vinegar with mixed results.

13:53:29
Ruri P
I'm afraid of doing the soap because two times I took in the enemas and and all the liquid never came out.

13:53:41
DeeDee
Ruri, definitely look at what comes out, yes.  That is one of the good things about colonics. I can see what comes out through the tube which is much easier than trying to see it in the toilet.  Many times all you see is brown liquid.

13:54:24
DeeDee
What type of soap and how much?  Did you follow with a plain water or salt water enema?

13:54:50
Ruri P
I suppose you are talking about a 3-part enema?

13:55:02
Larry
That little lever on the tank is just like a &quot;refresh&quot; button on your computer! ;) 

13:55:07
Dave
Was similar in old days when a doctor was not in easy reach and home care included enemas as needed. Had MD's seal of approval.

13:55:19
DeeDee
Yes, the 3 series is very helpful to get further up and get a more thorough cleanse.

13:55:51
Ruri P
Like you do coffee, you purge and then salt and purge that and then something else?  And back to back, right?

13:57:17
Ruri P
The soap bar is one that is especially for colonic cleansing. I believe I also have the instructions but I'm sort of worried that my body will just absorb it like it did the vinegar.

13:57:18
DeeDee
Yes, our protocol is to do the soap enema first, then a sea salt and peppermint, and you want to do the coffee last (in a clean colon).

13:57:48
Ruri P
Oh, I see that makes more sense then what I was doing!

13:57:59
DeeDee
Ruri, how much water are you using in an enema that you say it is absorbed?

13:58:00
Joseph
That's what I did yesterday, but with Folger's coffee.

13:58:33
DeeDee
Joseph, when will you try our specially made-for-enemas coffee (much better for you)?

13:59:06
DeeDee
Folger's is not organic and not low in acidity, so I would try enema coffee if you can.

13:59:27
Joseph
Okay, I will use your coffee next, DeeDee.

13:59:31
DeeDee
Folger's sure does smell good, though, doesn't it?

13:59:41
Joseph
and tastes good :)

13:59:47
DeeDee
Great, Joseph!

14:00:07
Ruri P
hahah! :p  

14:00:13
Larry
Rub it in... when I'm trying to lay off the coffee... grrrr!

14:00:41
Joseph
Sorry, Larry!

14:00:42
DeeDee
I have to have my cup in the morning also, but I drink the enema stuff.

14:00:57
Joseph
Oh, didn't know that was for drinking as well, DeeDee.

14:01:13
DeeDee
Does anyone have anything else quick before we have to go?

14:01:32
Ruri P
Trust me, once you do a coffee enema, you'll never look at coffee the same way again and the smell will make you think of enemas... I drank coffee for the first time yesterday.... in 3 years!

14:01:40
Dave
It's tasty in another way. Believe me, LOL.

14:01:43
DeeDee
Yes, you can definitely drink it with much less guilt.

14:01:45
Larry
No... Thanks for hosting.  I've now learned your coffee works on both ends of the body.

14:02:10
Joseph
Not I, thank you very much DeeDee, and take care all.

14:02:16
Dave
Next chat?

14:02:27
DeeDee
That was great!  A pleasure to talk with you gentlemen today.

14:02:44
DeeDee
Thank you all!

14:02:49
DeeDee
Good bye for now

14:03:05
Ruri P
Would you recommend a particular incense  to allow sleep?

14:03:14
Ruri P
Is it OK to sleep at the same time?

14:03:14
Dave
Bye all.
