Hello Alan.

13:01:22
deedee
How are you today?  Any questions, or topics of concern?

13:02:11
deedee
Hello gleener

13:02:25
deedee
Any concerns or questions?

13:02:42
gleener
Hi   from  Louisiana.

13:02:50
Alan D
Well, I have major constipation issues which have caused bleeding hemorrhoids and an anal fissure.

13:02:59
Alan D
Iowa here.

13:03:18
deedee
What have you tried so far for the constipation?

13:04:06
gleener
Hi  Heather.

13:04:10
Alan D
Miralax senna docusate sodium bisacodyl suppositories.

13:04:42
Heather
Hi.

13:04:51
gleener
Miralax or  peg-3350  has  really  helped  me.

13:04:58
Joseph
Good afternoon all.

13:05:09
gleener
Hi  Joseph.

13:05:11
deedee
Hi Heather and Joseph. Welcome.  Lately I have had more customers trying the coconut and essential oil suppositories for anal fissures and hemorrhoids.

13:05:54
Alan D
I have been taking the Miralax 3 times a day. My problems are from many meds I take for back pain.

13:06:06
deedee
We  use reacted magnesium, which seems to work well, but wouldn't it be great to get to the root of the problem? Why you are having constipation?

13:06:51
deedee
OK, medications are causing it.  How often are you using the bathroom?

13:06:53
Heather
I am new to enemas, having used colon hydrotherapy in the past, and I have a few questions.  But, first of all, I want to thank you for your excellent website and all the information.  It is really helpful and gives one hope!

13:07:16
deedee
Thank you, Heather.  Ask any questions that you have.

13:07:20
Alan D
Every third day.

13:07:44
deedee
Alan, are you taking enemas at all right now?

13:08:30
Alan D
I was twice a week until the hemorrhoids and fissure showed up.

13:08:33
Heather
Thanks.  I have had a lifelong problem with constipation, which has gotten better in general with improved nutrition (Weston A. Price Foundation member).  In trying to heal my gut with the GAPS (Gut and Psychology Syndrome) diet, I've had more constipation.

13:08:47
Alan D
Too painful to get a nozzle in.

13:09:46
deedee
Yes, sometimes diet changes can make things worse. Can you determine specifically what about the diet you think is causing the most problems for you?

13:10:21
Heather
My gut (no gas/bloating anymore, and less gurgling) is better.  But I've had to use enemas about every 2-3 days.  I wanted the slant board, but don't think will fit in my bathroom, so started with your $8.50 travel kit.

13:11:35
Alan D
Someone has suggested to me that I take a daily enema, but would that be too often?

13:11:35
deedee
Alan, it looks like we have to start internally then with reacted magnesium and some herbs, and topical oils, etc. to heal that area a little more so that you can do some enemas.

13:12:28
deedee
How are the enemas going so far, Heather?  Do you feel you are cleaning out well enough?  Are you having bowel movements between cleansings?

13:12:32
Heather
Now I'm trying to decide on which enema kit to purchase and what nozzle.   Questions are:  1) How much grapefruit seed extract really disinfects the kit?  I've been using about 20-30 drops and soaking for a few hours or overnight.

13:13:13
deedee
Alan, daily enemas are sometimes needed initially, and then once more healing occurs and the colon starts working better, you can back off.

13:13:37
Heather
The enemas are going well.  I'm able to take about 1-2 quarts with each successive one and I feel like I'm cleaning out pretty well.  But, no BMs between cleansings.  I had cut out most supplements, but my MD, using energy, has me on a lot of supplements.

13:14:12
Alan D
I did get a script to help with the fissure - Diltiazem gel.

13:14:15
deedee
That is a perfect amount of GSE.  You only need to soak about 3 - 4 hours, but overnight is OK.  Do you just soak the nozzle or the whole kit and are you doing it every time?

13:15:06
Heather
Now I'm coming off some long-term medications (prozac, clonazepam) under her care, and she sensed I need a boost in nutrition.  But, I'd love to get the nutrition from food - that will happen.  Maybe I'm still not eating enough fat.  But, trying.

13:15:38
Heather
I am soaking the whole kit, as mine doesn't have a separate nozzle.

13:15:45
deedee
Heather, do the supplements you are taking seem to be helping?

13:16:15
gleener
Hi   jbs.

13:16:17
Heather
I just began them today.  But, whenever anyone uses energy testing to choose/dose my supplements, they always help me out.

13:16:28
deedee
Heather, do you know if you seem to be absorbing things well right now, or do you need to work on the entire digestive system?

13:17:54
deedee
Alan, I do not know a lot about that gel. What does it have in it?

13:18:07
deedee
Welcome jbs.

13:18:10
Heather
I doubt I'm absorbing things well, but I'm back to homemade chicken stock blended vegetable soups.  I think I moved too quickly from those to solid foods, or that's my MD's thinking.  Not sure how to answer.... 

13:18:29
gleener
Joseph,  have  you  been  taking for  a  long  time?

13:18:40
deedee
That is great, Heather.  Are any of them specific for the digestive system?

13:19:13
Heather
I believe so.  There are a lot, but a good aloe vera juice is one of them.  Do you have anything in mind?

13:19:40
jbs
Hi, I'm buying into your program and recently started taking enemas. The first attempts were no fun, but now I have the hang of it. Yesterday I did a high enema as the #3 and was able to retain it for a long time (1 hour) then emptied a small portion.

13:19:57
deedee
I was just wondering if you were doing the basics like probiotics and enzymes.

13:20:14
Joseph
Gleener, I've been taking about 4 years now.

13:20:28
jbs
(cont) But I had no urge to do more, and a day later I still have not. Is this normal?

13:20:51
deedee
Jbs, congrats on taking enemas effectively.  What are you holding for an hour? And how much fluid?

13:21:04
gleener
Well,  washing  the  colon   has  been  good  for me   for  forty  years.

13:21:18
jbs
2 quarts

13:21:47
jbs
Just used some peppermint oil.

13:22:19
deedee
Jbs, when you do a high enema like that and then do not have a bowel movement, it is because your transit time is slow (which is what creates the constipation most of the time).

13:22:40
deedee
Taking enemas should improve this, but I would not hold a regular enema for that long since things are absorbing into the body. That is why you had little release.

13:22:49
Joseph
I hope to be washing my colon for forty more years, gleener :)

13:22:57
jbs
Suggestions?

13:23:52
gleener
At  some  point   you  may  want  to   try   the  colon  tube  for  the  high  enemas.

13:23:59
deedee
If the enema is a cleansing enema, hold it no more than ten minutes.  If it is an implant like coffee or aloe juice/olive oil, or probiotics, those you can hold for longer periods of time.

13:24:26
Heather
I have been on probiotics and digestive enzymes for awhile.  I'm sticking with the Enzymedica Digest Gold, but my MD switched me from the Biolkult to something called Perque Digesta Guard Forte.

13:24:31
deedee
Yes, colon tubes are very effective at getting water up higher and more comfortably.

13:24:56
jbs
I wasn't trying to hold it that long; it just didn't empty.

13:25:04
gleener
I  use   a   fr42   and  can  easily  insert  gently  into  the  cecum.

13:26:12
deedee
Heather, that sounds great!  I am glad your MD is going more natural with you.

13:26:35
Heather
She is great!  How does one improve transit time?  Also, if coffee makes me jittery (I don't drink it), then would a coffee enema not be for me?

13:27:16
deedee
Oh jbs, I thought you were intentially trying to hold.  Try adding 1 tsp. up to       1  Tbsp. of Celtic Sea Salt per quart which should help you release.  Add about 3 drops of peppermint per quart to that.

13:28:31
Joseph
I just started using a colon tube recently, gleener. Recently have been unable to get it more than about 6 inches in me. Any suggestions?

13:28:41
jbs
Thanks. Another question: I saw an implant in the booklet that included MSM. I can't find much on the benefits, or what it is.

13:28:50
deedee
Heather, doing enemas will help to tone the colon and should help transit time along with the enzymes and probiotics, but sometimes people use herbs such as fenugreek and chamomile to help transit time.

13:30:21
gleener
Joseph try letting in a cup of the water to open those valves.

13:30:31
deedee
Joseph, how I get colon tubes into client successfully is to let a little water into the colon as I am working the colon tube up.  You may need to switch positions a little also to get a better angle.

13:30:36
Heather
I think I have had gas and bloating for so many years that perhaps got the peristalsis going, and now that I no longer have gas/bloating, it may just take time to retrain my body's peristalsis.  Do they take fenugreek and chamomile in the enema or orally?

13:31:36
gleener
What  size  colon  tube,  Joseph?

13:31:40
Joseph
Thank you. I will give those ideas a shot next time.

13:31:58
deedee
MSM is Methylsulfonylmethane. It is for musculoskeletal health and helps to heal the lining/tissues of the colon.

13:31:59
ted c
Thanks for the info, DeeDee, about my upcoming surgery.

13:32:26
gleener
It's a  learning  experience,  so  be  patient.

13:32:57
gleener
Hi   Deborah.

13:33:07
Deborah W
Hi there.

13:33:26
Joseph
I believe a 32fr, gleener.

13:33:35
deedee
Welcome, Ted and Deborah.

13:33:59
deedee
Ted, was that helpful?  Do you have any other questions regarding that?

13:34:12
gleener
Should  work  fine  as  you  get  the drift  of  it.

13:34:27
deedee
Those 32 FR colon tubes work the best for me and usually for beginners for sure.  They have less drag.

13:34:53
Joseph
Bought it from OHN, silicone.

13:34:54
jbs
Question: why are people other than DeeDee giving advice. Are they part of the host collection?

13:34:54
ted c
Well, right now I'm thinking that would be good. I guess size of suppository would be my main concern. :)

13:35:44
deedee
We are all here to share info and experiences to help each other along.  I am always learning more from all of my clients and customers.

13:36:38
gleener
We  are  glad  you  are  there,   DeeDee.

13:37:28
Joseph
Yes, I enjoy the daytime chats, work in the evenings.

13:38:01
deedee
Ted, the size of the suppository is fairly small.  I make them here using about 1 Tablespoon of coconut oil and then about 5 drops of the designated essential oil. (I make up different combos of oils for different concerns.) This makes for a very good size.

13:38:38
deedee
Thank you, gleener! Glad you are out there also!

13:39:24
Joseph
Welcome back,  Deborah.

13:39:44
ted c
I have good coconut oil. If you put together the proper oils, I could make my suppositories at home.

13:39:49
Joseph
Are those for hemorrhoids, DeeDee?

13:40:10
Heather
If I'm sensitive to caffeine (absolutely cannot drink regular coffee and even black tea makes me jittery), do I need to avoid coffee enemas?  I'm interested in trying them to detox, but not if it makes me jittery.

13:40:42
deedee
Heather, most people are taking the herbs orally, but I am beginning to use more and more things in the colon because the absorption is so great there. You could try coffee enemas, only you would want to water them down a bit to start so you can see how it affects you first. You may want to go with 1/2 Tbsp. of grounds and about 3 cups of water to start.  Only do this after at least one (or 2) cleansing enemas.

13:42:33
Alan D
Should I put anything in my enemas to help heal the hemorrhoids?

13:42:48
Heather
Thanks, DeeDee.  So I could try the herbs orally as well as in an enema, and then try watered down coffee in an enema to see how it affects me.

13:44:01
deedee
Ted, yes, you would have to do the coconut oil part yourself and I can send you the oils mixed in a little dram that you may not have. 

13:44:44
deedee
Yes, Heather, and please keep me posted on how it is working for you.

13:45:28
ted c
Should I order that in an email?

13:46:14
deedee
Some oils to use for hemorrhoids are lemon, peppermint, wintergreen, panaway.

13:46:57
Alan D
OK, thanks, DeeDee.

13:46:59
Joseph
Do you have articles on the website on how to use those oils, DeeDee?

13:47:02
Heather
Thank you, DeeDee.  I'm a little overwhelmed with purchasing another enema kit.  I'm going to read the website again, but any thoughts?

13:47:58
deedee
Lavender is also good for the hemorrhoids. You can put those oils into an enema also, but having them closer to the area would be better.

13:48:08
Deborah W
I have a brand new silicone enema kit I haven't used yet.  I can see you all have experience and I haven't really begun.  I wanted to see what this was like. Thanks for listening!

13:49:16
deedee
Joseph, we do have a section on essential oils on the website with several links that talk about the different oils and how to use them.  In our latest newsletter, we do have a little article about the suppositories also.  That is a newer thing for us.

13:49:34
Joseph
Thank you very much, DeeDee.

13:50:09
Alan D
So would putting the oils on a glove and using a finger be better?

13:50:19
deedee
Deborah, we will help you along any way we can. Do you have any specific questions on how to get started?

13:51:40
ted c
I've thought about essential oil implants before, but haven't so far. I guess post-op will be my first chance. I've always wondered whether the retention plug was necessary or not. What do you think?

13:52:05
deedee
You would want to mix the oils with a carrier oil like olive, coconut or sesame first, then you could apply them topically, and our Super Salve works well for topical application also.

13:52:32
Alan D
OK, thanks again.

13:53:42
deedee
Ted, I would not use the retention plug right now because it does stretch the anal muscles, which would not be good after surgery.

13:54:22
gleener
Deborah, you  will have  years   of  better  health.

13:54:55
ted c
Yeah, I figured that. Do most people who use implants need it?

13:55:24
Deborah W
Thanks, DeeDee.  I have periodontal disease. They want to do expensive surgery - 3 implants, lots of money and inconvience.  I cancelled the appointment yesterday!  I wonder if doing the 10 day cleanse would significantly heal my gums and this is probably not the place?

13:57:04
gleener
Once  again,  thanks,  DeeDee.    Must  be going  now     - so  long.

13:58:08
deedee
Doing the cleanse is a great start.  There are also supplements that you can take to heal gum tissue.

13:58:30
Joseph
Thank you, DeeDee, I will look up those articles and read the newsletter. Have a great week all!

13:58:54
deedee
You also Joseph, thanks for joining in.

13:59:00
Heather
Thanks so much for the information, DeeDee, and everyone else.  It's so nice to have a forum to discuss these issues.

13:59:05
Deborah W
What supplements to heal gum disease?

13:59:46
deedee
Thank you, Heather!  Keep me posted.  You all can e-mail me to for individual questions.

14:01:20
Alan D
Bye all

14:01:22
deedee
Echinacea, golden seal, gotu kola,  cataplex A-C-P (vitamins, minerals, glandular) specific mixture for the gums.

14:01:36
deedee
Bye, Alan, and thanks! 

14:02:06
deedee
Thank you all!!  Have a great rest of the week and weekend! 

14:02:18
jbs
What do you charge for consultation via phone, e mail?

14:02:34
deedee
Goodbye, Heather, and thanks!

14:02:43
ted c
I'll email you about the oils.

14:02:55
ted c
So long...

14:03:00
Heather
Goodbye, but I can't figure out how to log out!  I guess when the session ends it will log me out....

14:03:05
deedee
Consultations are $1.40 per minute.  There is some consultation free with testing also.

14:03:17
jbs
Explain.

14:03:18
deedee
Thank you, Ted!

14:04:08
deedee
Jbs, if you purchase one of our tests, some consultation time comes free with each test.  Usually people do start with a consultation first.

14:04:33
jbs
Just call you for an appointment?

14:04:56
jbs
What tests?

14:05:15
deedee
Yes, just call or e-mail me.

14:05:57
jbs
Thanks, guess time is up. 

14:06:10
Deborah W
Thanks all!

14:06:18
deedee
Good bye all.
