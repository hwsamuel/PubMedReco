Hi everyone.

20:00:37
Sarah C
Hi - If I buy one of the complete colon cleanse kits with the colon tube, do I have to buy connectors, or are they supplied?

20:01:17
Dave
Hi all. My first evening chat in awhile.

20:01:43
kristina
Hi Sarah. Welcome. All needed connectors are included in the Complete Colon Cleanse Kits.

20:01:49
kristina
Hi Dave. Welcome to you.

20:02:00
Sarah C
Thanks - that is a relief - I'm glad I asked.

20:02:38
Sarah C
Is there a topic?  Does someone lead this? 

20:03:46
kristina
Yes, I am working on the topic now, which is adrenal fatigue. And you are welcome to talk about anything else related to health, colon cleansing, etc.

20:04:10
kristina
Welcome Heather!

20:04:15
kristina
and Randy

20:04:27
randyu
Isn't adrenal fatigue related to diet and nutrition?

20:04:29
Sarah C
Is there another place where we can get connected more regularly regarding this topic?  I've heard of a couple of places on the web, but it seems that they are a little weird.

20:04:29
Heather M
Thanks, Kristina!  Love your website, information and products.

20:05:32
Sarah C
I take adrenal supplements - my holistic doctor says my adrenals are shot.  Sometimes when I take them too regularly I lose my voice.  

20:05:33
kristina
Connected regarding enemas? Can you be more specific about your needs? I would love to hear the details.

20:06:06
kristina
I have not heard of adrenal supplements causing one to lose one's voice. Any idea why this might happen?

20:06:38
kristina
OK, adrenal fatigue - it is all too common. How many of you feel tired often, if not all of the time, or know some one who does?

20:06:53
Sarah C
Um - well - I want to know other people who practice this lifestyle who are more experienced and frankly not real perverted.  I really am excited about this change of lifestyle and it seems that when I broach the subject with others, they accept me...

20:07:00
Sarah C
...but they just think I am plain weird.

20:07:12
kristina
Yes, this is not an uncommon response.

20:07:35
kristina
Please call our office as we are always happy to support people who are taking on this lifestyle.

20:07:59
kristina
Also, I do have a blog that I post on twice weekly. We have a bi-monthly live chat. And you can email us anytime.

20:08:00
Sarah C
Thanks - I appreciate that Kristina.

20:08:26
kristina
And we have a Facebook page, where I would happily exchange ideas with you on a regular basis.

20:08:34
Heather M
The loss of one's voice makes me think of thryoid issues.  My voice gets raspy when my thyroid hormones are low (hypothyroid).  But, if my adrenal can't handle the increase in thyroid, I can't take thyroid meds/supplements until the adrenals are stronger.

20:08:37
Sarah C
I think I may have spoken with you or someone the other day.  I was surprised that my call was returned.  Very cool.

20:09:36
kristina
Yes, that was DeeDee. DeeDee and I both know how difficult the process of changing over to a healthy lifestyle can be, so we work real hard to be available to people when they need us.

20:09:47
Sarah C
I was told my thyroid was messed up, but I had very over emotional reactions to the medicine.  It is all natural - Premier labs.  Very good stuff - but I could not handle the feeling that I was feeling so deeply and seriously about trivial things and...

20:10:04
kristina
You probably know that we have a book called Ten Days to Optimal Health, which is very useful too.

20:10:15
Sarah C
...bursting into tears easily.  So then I tried the adrenal stuff and it really works as long as I don't take too much.  

20:10:39
kristina
What exactly are you taking for your adrenals? Do you mind listing the ingredients?

20:10:49
Heather M
How does the health of the colon support adrenal strength?  This is something I know nothing about.  Is this in your book, Kristina?  I bought it and have read parts and scanned it through...

20:11:42
Sarah C
I am going to have a long road.  Honestly.  I had a surgery about 5 years ago and finally linked that to my over 100 pound weight gain.  I was already overweight - now I am 300 pounds.

20:11:43
kristina
I have just written a new blog post about adrenal health and the history of the soda Dr Pepper that will be posted in the next day or two. Very interesting read.

20:12:57
Sarah C
I don't drink sodas.  I am allergic to tons of foods.  Milk, wheat. I pretty much just eat whatever because I get so tired of being allergic to so many foods.  I have cut out meats a lot.  That makes me feel better.

20:13:17
kristina
First of all, regarding how  the health of the colon supports adrenal health, is that the body is all connected. Truthfully, you can't have struggles in one part of the body without those imbalances, inflammation, or overload effecting EVERY OTHER part of the body.

20:13:43
kristina
Second of all, elimination of hormones needs to be optimized in order for the adrenals to be healthy.

20:13:52
randyu
What good does it do to colon cleanse if you eat junk food?

20:14:06
Sarah C
Off topic... I think I have a fatty liver... I have been doing a lot of research lately about the colon and my liver and how you will crave the stuff that your body is allergic to... My friends kid me - and tell me to go to medical school.

20:14:20
Heather M
Aha!  Hormones! How do you eliminate the hormones, other than regular bowel movements, or enemas (which I'm using about every other day).

20:14:41
kristina
No, the blog post isn't about drinking soda; it is about an advertising campaign used in the early 1900s because of what doctors were finding out about adrenal health, which still isn't mainstream, so that so many people don't end up with adrenal fatigue.

20:15:10
Sarah C
It keeps me from having to deal with all the effects I could have if I did not.  It's like doing drugs and flushing out my system completely the next day.  My skin is great, my hair - but it's catching up to me.

20:16:04
kristina
Most hormones are eliminated through the urine and through the bile, meaning out the colon.

20:16:45
kristina
What good does it do to cleanse the colon, even if one is eating junk food?

20:17:02
randyu
yes

20:17:18
Heather M
I'm looking forward to reading this blog post about adrenals and is still not mainstream....I periodically have trouble with fat digestion.  MUCH better than in the past, but the past few days, blond stools that float, so I know I'm not digesting my fats. 

20:18:10
kristina
You have a good point, that eating junk food is not a healthy habit to be engaged in. And, you would be amazed at how many clients we have who don't eat a healthy diet but claim that they feel great because of their weekly enema.

20:18:52
Sarah C
Opotia Cactus, Cordyceps Simensis, Arabnogalactin, Bladderwrack, Skullcap, Dandelion, Lovage, Guggal, Noni Fruit

20:19:07
Sarah C
There's more - there's a lot of good ingredients in this brand.

20:19:09
randyu
They take an enema once a week, just to cleanse then?

20:19:13
kristina
A junk food diet creates a tremendous amount of work with all those additives, preservatives, pesticides, trans fats, etc., that any help the body can keep eliminating all that crap is going to be helpful.

20:19:23
kristina
Why do you ask, Randy?

20:19:32
kristina
Welcome, David.

20:19:48
Heather M
They probably feel better because more toxins are released in an enema that might have stuck around until they had a bowel movement.

20:19:54
kristina
Yes, many people do take an enema once a week, come rain or shine!

20:19:56
Dave
Even a &quot;good&quot; enema doesn't make up for a week of junk, of course.

20:20:14
Sarah C
That is what I do.  I'm just being honest.  What I am hoping to accomplish here is - well first I want to buy a better enema system - is to feel the health benefits from the enemas so much that I am encouraged to not eat the bad stuff.

20:20:18
Sarah C
It is starting to encourage me...

20:20:27
Heather M
So, how can we encourage the bile (liver, gallbladder?) to work better at eliminating hormones?

20:20:51
kristina
I encourage folks to experiment with the frequency of enemas. Try taking one a day for awhile. Take more enemas when you are under stress or in contact with more toxins, like painting your house, spring pollen, etc.

20:20:56
randyu
It helps for an otherwise healthy person to take a weekly enema?

20:20:58
kristina
See how you feel.

20:21:20
kristina
Yes, Randy, taking a weekly enema seems to work well for lots of people.

20:21:26
Sarah C
I am an emotional eater.  This is why I eat junk.  The enemas help me to feel balanced.  That is why I am saving for a better system.  I have a junk cheap flimsy system now.

20:21:52
Sarah C
I've been doing coffee enemas at least once a week - trying 2-3 times a week.

20:22:16
kristina
Sarah, I just lost the top part of your thread, which I was catching up on, so if I don't address something you have said, let me know.

20:22:44
Sarah C
I &quot;talk&quot; type a lot - it's OK.

20:23:05
kristina
For adrenal health, we have found either licorice root or Rehmannia reliably give us the best clinical results.

20:23:13
Sarah C
Cool.

20:23:18
kristina
I like that you are talking a lot, just so you know.

20:23:53
Heather M
It helps to have a support network, online and/or in real time/life to help one eat better.  It can be lonely to try to do it all alone.  I am following the GAPS diet (Gut and Psychology Syndrome), and follow several discussion groups, which helps.

20:23:58
kristina
Know that we have a monthly sale the last five days of each month, for 15% off.

20:23:58
Sarah C
Funny - I always thought it was bad - but I guess if I surround myself with good listeners and listen when they talk and keep the topic interesting... ha ha.

20:24:40
David M
K, when you get a chance, could you address the best methods of using the essential oils?

20:24:49
kristina
Yes, I agree, Heather. Hopefully we can chat on Facebook, but I also know that isn't as private as one might want.

20:25:18
Heather M
Thanks for the sale info, Kristina!  I missed the last one and was disappointed.  Also, I didn't know about Facebook, so I'll have to check that out (and learn to use it better).

20:25:38
kristina
Maybe the OHC will start a chat group one of these days.

20:25:41
Sarah C
Essential oils in enemas?  What is safe?

20:25:59
Heather M
Would love an OHC chat group!

20:26:07
kristina
We have lots of written materials about using essential oils in the enema.

20:26:19
Sarah C
Wouldn't that be hard to clean?  Speaking of cleaning...  what is best used to clean the tubes?

20:26:45
Dave
Even a &quot;good&quot; enema doesn't make up for a week of junk, of course.

20:26:55
kristina
We have developed a method of testing which oils each person would do best using body feedback.

20:27:00
Sarah C
Dave - I agree.  I'm ashamed I have these unhealthy habits.  

20:27:24
kristina
No, with some hot soapy water the oil comes right out.

20:28:01
kristina
You can get little bottle cleaners. Soak tubes in hot water, soap, and grapefruit seed extract after you have run hot water through it.

20:28:26
Sarah C
Too bad you are so far away! I'd love to get tested.  I've been experimenting with essential oils for 10 years.  I had to pick my own topic for a speech class... and never looked back.  Thanks Kristina.  

20:28:33
kristina
So, anyone know anyone who is &quot;tired all the time&quot;?

20:28:34
Dave
With constipating drugs, a weekly enema is always needed. Only occasional  as needed in childhood.

20:29:06
Sarah C
Will the grapefruit extract keep the white silicone bag and tubing from staining from the coffee enemas?

20:29:18
Heather M
I know lots of people who are tired all the time....look at the growth of Starbucks and people drinking coffee all day long.

20:29:34
kristina
Cortisol, a hormone produced by the adrenal glands to handle stress, which includes fluctuations in blood sugar levels, is both a savior to the human body and a destroyer of the human body.

20:29:47
randyu
Yes, Dave, and as we age we tend to get more irregular too.  Enemas help with that.

20:29:58
David M
I understand the oils in the 2nd enema in the series, but DeeDee sent me an email about waiting until after the coffee one and using as an implant or suppository.

20:30:00
kristina
It is highly catabolic, meaning it actually eats up the body when it is present.

20:30:00
Sarah C
Me.  I'm always tired.  I have to take caffeine all the time or ginseng. I get really tired at work - all the time.

20:30:51
kristina
So many of us, given our stressful lives, health imbalances, mood swings, and inadequate eating habits, end up with too much cortisol in our systems too often.

20:31:04
kristina
Do you know that cortisol actually &quot;eats&quot; the brain?

20:31:17
Sarah C
I've been taking tumeric - I heard that.

20:32:10
Heather M
So, other than eating a balanced diet (lots of quality fats, protein, vegetables, with little sweets/junk/caffeine, and keeping stress low, what can one do to reduce cortisol levels?  Cortisol eats the brain?  Where can I learn more about this?

20:32:36
randyu
Kristina, wouldn't metamucil taken daily eliminate the need for the enema to cleanse weekly?  

20:34:24
kristina
Tumeric is good for many things, including supporting healthy liver function and bile secretion, supporting the healthy breakdown of fats, improving circulation, maintaining and supporting joint health.

20:35:23
kristina
I will be writing about adrenal health a lot in my blog. We are also putting together a liquid herbal formula that is unique on the market to support adrenal health - with Rehmannia, Echinacea, Ashwaganda, and Licorice.

20:36:15
kristina
When using supplements to treat adrenal fatigue, it is best to use herbs that have a long recorded history of use, like licorice.

20:36:47
kristina
The ancient Assyrian, Egyptian, Chinese and Indian cultures were the first to document its use.

20:37:10
kristina
Rehmannia and licorice are both adrenal restoratives and adrenal tonics.

20:37:56
kristina
With your adrenal formula you want it to do the work of aiding in recovery of the adrenal cortex, to support adrenal cortex function in times of high stress,

20:38:38
Sarah C
I'm allergic to echinacea, goldenseal, ginseng (though I take that), some bitter herb that helps with allergies... I'm a mess.

20:38:40
kristina
 to reduce fatigue, anxiety, and sleeplessness and to improve immune function.

20:39:00
Sarah C
I thought licorice was dangerous - high blood pressure?

20:39:05
Dave
Enemas were in ancient cultures too, of course.

20:39:15
kristina
Add, even if a person doesn't have adrenal fatigue, it is likely that supporting the adrenal glands throughout one's lifetime will increase longevity.

20:39:48
kristina
Licorice is safe when taken as recommended.

20:40:02
Sarah C
I make my own pills - what is recommended?  

20:40:12
kristina
However, in high doses and over a long period of time, it can cause potassium depletion and hypertension.

20:40:49
kristina
What do you mean, you make your own pills, out of what?

20:41:12
Sarah C
Just like - I love gotu kola - but I have to take it when I can sleep the whole next day.  It seems to balance me out when I take it once a week.  

20:41:43
kristina
Randy, taking metamucil, or psyllium powder, does not eliminate the need for the enema to cleanse weekly. First of all, psyllium doesn't work for everyone.

20:41:45
Sarah C
I have a kit and I buy the capsules and the herbs.  My 12-year-old makes them too.

20:41:59
Sarah C
&quot;00&quot; size capsules

20:42:26
Sarah C
My mother studied herbs and I have been studying them for a while.  It's a hobby.

20:42:48
kristina
Second of all, psyllium taken daily can increase one's need for regular enemas because it creates more stool so a person could be eliminating more but still not fully eliminating each and every day.

20:43:21
kristina
Gotu kola makes you have to sleep a lot?

20:43:32
Sarah C
Yes.  For me.

20:44:47
randyu
Kristina, good point about psyllium - there are side effects, and people on it may eliminate well for a few days and then have constipation, then enema is needed.

20:45:11
kristina
For those of you who aren't familiar with gotu kola, it promotes healthy tissue function, supports the body's normal repair processes, is adaptogenic, and tones the vascular system.

20:46:01
kristina
I find that liquid herbs  bring better results, more quickly, for most people, as long as there is compliance and they aren't sensitive to alcohol.

20:46:03
Sarah C
I have strange reactions to a lot of things.  I was taking that &quot;silver&quot; and I would become overwhelmingly dizzy.  I had to not take it.  Just a few drops and I would have to lie down.

20:46:08
kristina
That is great that you study herbs. 

20:46:25
kristina
I became chronically ill about 15 years ago.

20:46:38
Heather M
Thanks for the info about gotu kola; I was not familiar with it.  Kristina,  using enemas more often will eventually help with transit time, yes?  

20:46:42
randyu
What was wrong, Kristina?

20:47:02
kristina
Liquid herbs have notably given me the best results for all my health struggles, along with a strict diet and colon cleanses.

20:47:02
Dave
I guess there is a delicate balance between not enough and too much psyllium.

20:47:04
Sarah C
Yes - I'm waiting to hear more Kristina.

20:47:44
randyu
Kristina, how often do you do colon cleanse?

20:48:40
kristina
Multiple chemical sensitivities, celiac disease, mood imbalances, lots of diarrhea and constipation, even bloody diarrhea, adrenal fatigue, thyroid imbalances, etc.

20:48:49
kristina
Varies, Randy.

20:48:52
Heather M
Kristina, liquid herbs makes sense.  Fresh juicing without fiber is supposed to get the nutrients into the system more quickly, as it doesn't have to be digested.  So, that would be the same for liquid herbals, I would think.

20:49:27
Sarah C
So with your practices now - you are keeping all this under control?  Kristina - are you the doctor on all the videos?  

20:49:33
kristina
Yes. They are so much more bioavailable!

20:49:48
kristina
Yes, I am the person on all the videos.

20:49:58
Sarah C
Ok - good - I feel like I know you then :)

20:50:32
kristina
And, yes, I am very, very healthy. And, I tend my body rigorously. And, new issues crop up from time to time that I unravel.

20:51:26
Sarah C
You look great - your health seems good!  Doesn't cascara sagrada have a similar effect to the psyllium?  I was taking that for a while and I had to get a colonoscopy and my doctor got really mad at me - told me to stop taking it.  Way before I started...

20:51:30
kristina
For instance, I have been having a lot of numbness and tingling in my arms and feet lately so I have been trying lots of different approaches. Turns out, I have a severe caffience allergy. I even had to give up kombucha!

20:51:35
Sarah C
Enemas - I've only been doing that for a year or so.

20:51:41
kristina
Thank you.

20:51:59
kristina
No, cascara sagrada is a laxative. Psyllium is a bulking agent.

20:52:07
Heather M
Kristina, I'm so glad you have found a way to be healthy.  It is inspiring, especially because I have many of the same issues you have dealt with.  That is helpful to hear about new issues cropping up, AND about tending your body rigorously.

20:52:26
kristina
Cascara sagrada, an herb from a tree, can stain the walls of the colon.

20:52:51
kristina
Thank you, Heather. Yes, it is awesome to be able to resolve very difficult health issues.

20:53:14
kristina
And, it ain't so bad to have to take care of myself so well, either.

20:53:14
Heather M
That is too bad about kombucha.  I LOVE kombucha, and can tolerate it, I think, even though I don't tolerate caffeine well.  Actually, as my health has improved, I can periodically have a cup of black tea without the nervousness.  

20:53:51
Sarah C
OK, I see - I wonder if that was why the doc was so irritated!!  It did feel like I was never finished going to the bathroom.  But a lot of my stomach issues seemed to dissipate and I was losing weight...

20:53:53
randyu
And Kristina, you are able to share this and help so many others like us!

20:53:54
kristina
It has become a way to help others, and I hate being in pain. I get very worried that I am going to die.

20:54:45
kristina
We offer a few solutions that give the same effect without the discoloration, like a supplement called GB-3. You can call the office and talk to DeeDee about it.

20:55:04
kristina
Yes, Randy. My work is blessed.

20:55:18
Sarah C
Since I always feel tired - and I like ginseng - but am allergic - I wonder if this kombucha would work for me.  I was prescribed synthetic ginseng - euleorthra root or something and did not tolerate that at all.

20:55:23
kristina
As is my life, even though it has been very, very hard.

20:55:37
kristina
Hi Don!

20:55:48
don g
Hi

20:55:48
randyu
Hi Don

20:56:07
randyu
:) 

20:56:18
Heather M
I just need to remember to keep it periodically, and not every day.  I think the tending the body issue is really key.  That's just not very societally acceptable, really.  But it's so important to listen to our body and heed its call for help.

20:56:33
kristina
Sarah, call and talk to DeeDee. She can help you out. I don't think using the kombucha for that purpose is a good idea but you can certainly try it. If you like it, it does help with immunity and improving the healthy balance of intestinal flora.

20:56:42
kristina
We will close in a few minutes.

20:56:51
kristina
Next live chat is in two weeks at noon. 

20:57:04
randyu
Thanks kristina, and all...

20:57:11
kristina
May 25th

20:57:14
Sarah C
Thanks Kristina - I feel home here.  This is the stuff I need to talk about with people and no one is on this level with me! They think I'm so different!

20:57:20
Dave
Will aim to make it.

20:57:21
Heather M
Thanks, Kristina and everyone.  It's great to have a forum to discuss these issues.  And I'll look forward to checking out Facebook.

20:57:54
kristina
It is becoming more and more acceptable to tend the body and MOST people are hurting in some way or another once they hit a certain age.

20:58:06
kristina
You, too, can inspire others.

20:58:15
randyu
Good night all.

20:58:21
Dave
It's all a learning experience!

20:58:51
Heather M
Good night all!

20:59:06
Dave
Be well, all.

20:59:22
randyu
Thanks Kristina.

20:59:44
kristina
I was thinking that I would ask a few people to film themselves and put the video up on YouTube, talking about their health struggles. Then, we would work with them over some months through the Optimal Health Center and we could follow their progress on YouTube. If you or anyone you know is interested, I would offer free consults and supplements at cost.

20:59:55
kristina
Good night all!

21:00:48
Sarah C
Good night - thanks for being here.
