Welcome everyone.  Sorry I am late.  I had some signing in issues today.

13:13:23
deedee
Hi Derek.

13:13:27
DerekJ
Wow, first one on the chat!

13:13:36
DerekJ
Hello DeeDee. How are you?

13:13:39
deedee
Any topics of discussion for you today?

13:13:55
deedee
I am great!  How are you doing?

13:14:14
DerekJ
Not really, but I was wondering if you have ever heard of anyone using Astaxanthin in their solution?

13:14:24
DerekJ
I'm good! Just working.

13:15:03
DerekJ
This is my first chat btw. I'm Derek. You printed my testimonial in the March newsletter. That is my story lol.

13:15:19
DerekJ
Hello Joe and Randy

13:15:35
DerekJ
and Dave.

13:15:41
randyu
Hello.

13:17:21
deedee
Any topics of discussion for anyone?

13:17:30
randyu
DeeDee, where can I get more info about IBS and treatment?

13:17:31
Dave
Subject du jour.

13:17:39
DerekJ
I was asking about Astaxanthin and if anyone has ever used it in a solution?

13:18:11
deedee
I have never heard of anyone using that. Has anyone else?

13:18:39
Joseph
I never have.

13:19:00
DerekJ
I was just curious, as it is much more potent than vitamin E.

13:19:04
deedee
I am not sure if that is absorbable by the colon or not.

13:19:51
DerekJ
I am soo very thankful for what you and Kristina

13:20:09
DerekJ
are doing to help educate me.

13:20:55
deedee
Oh, Derek, you are the one working on different things in the colon and if they can be absorbed or not, right?

13:21:27
DerekJ
Yes, currently I do the olive oil, MSM, aloe, Celtic sea salt and coffee enemas.

13:21:33
dennisr
Does any water enter a little into the small intestines?

13:21:36
deedee
I think that is such a new frontier really.  I am starting to see success with different oils and herbs, etc.

13:22:44
DerekJ
I may need to have you mix me up some oils, DeeDee. So far I have only done peppermint oil.

13:22:51
deedee
There should be no water entering the small intestine unless your ileocecal valve is not working properly.

13:23:37
deedee
Yes, the oils seem to be working great.  I have mixed them for prostate, fissures, IBS, diabetes, weight concerns, and other issues.

13:23:53
dennisr
Does it do any harm if some water enters the small intestines?

13:23:58
DerekJ
My issues are a fissure, and internal hemorrhoids.

13:24:26
deedee
You would not want contamination from the large intestine entering the small.  Do you feel that you have this issue?

13:24:26
DerekJ
Since doing enemas (and 2 colonic sessions) I have lost over 60 pounds FYI.

13:24:38
Dave
Re new frontier, I take it that nothing much more than soap was an additive in enemas before implants, etc., came along?

13:25:02
deedee
Derek, that is awesome!  The oils work well for hemorrhoids and fissures.

13:25:04
dennisr
No! Just wondering!

13:25:15
deedee
That is good, Dennis! 

13:25:24
DerekJ
I will be calling you regarding an oil mix.

13:25:44
DerekJ
I want to take the hair test as well to really fine-tune things.

13:26:18
DerekJ
Dave, I think Celtic sea salt works really well in the solution as well.

13:26:50
Dave
I've dropped 30, Derek, but mainly through meds that suppress appetite. I could stand to use it, luckily.

13:27:02
DerekJ
Nice, Dave!

13:27:08
deedee
Yes, Celtic sea salt is so nourishing  and the hair test is really eye-opening.

13:27:27
deedee
Welcome, Sandy.

13:27:28
randyu
What about IBS?

13:27:31
DerekJ
I lost so much weight, I had people freaking out, so I have added more fats to my diet. I am now at 225, from 216.

13:28:08
deedee
Healthy fats are very important to keep in your diet for energy, metabolism, etc.

13:28:09
DerekJ
I also stepped down from daily enemas to 3 times a week.

13:28:11
Dave
I'll show off the new me, DeeDee, lol.

13:28:38
DerekJ
Go Dave!  It is really easy to drop weight with enemas.

13:28:50
deedee
Dave, can't wait to see you.  Are you feeling well with the weight loss?  I want you to make sure you are still eating well!

13:29:06
randyu
Have to log off now. I will check the website for info about IBS.

13:29:22
deedee
It is great to be able to wean down on the enemas/colonics when your body starts working better on its own.

13:30:16
deedee
Randy, you can also e-mail me directly with questions  at deedee@[ourdomain].com. I apologize if I missed some questions when I was knocked out of the chat.

13:30:35
DerekJ
That article I posted is really good info.

13:31:09
DerekJ
OHN is an encyclopedia of colon knowledge for me lol.

13:31:42
dennisr
When I take in a gallon of water and hold it for 10 minutes, does enough cleaning of the ascending colon take place?  I am scheduled for a proctol next month. I hate taking all take medications they give before the test. What do you think?

13:31:55
deedee
I am glad you find us useful for info.  Have you checked out our lovely and informative new videos yet, anyone?

13:32:18
deedee
Of course it is hard to watch yourself (meaning me) on a video.  A little embarrassing!

13:32:49
DerekJ
I find them to be very informative, and keep learning new ideas.

13:32:54
Joseph
I saw one... Good video, DeeDee.

13:33:12
DerekJ
I just listened to Kristina's audio interview last night.

13:33:44
deedee
Dennis, just one enema, even if it is a large one like that, will probably not clean you out enough for a colonoscopy.  We find a couple of day's worth of cleansing with a series of enemas and fasting will get you through so you don't have to take medication.

13:33:55
Dave
A star is  born!

13:33:59
DerekJ
Dennis, if the water is coming out clear, I would say you have cleared the colon pretty well. 

13:34:19
deedee
Thank you, Joseph!  That was totaly unprepared and unrehearsed.

13:34:53
deedee
Thanks, Dave!

13:35:01
Joseph
Oh, well you pulled it off like a pro.

13:35:20
Dave
How do I access Kris' broadcast?

13:36:01
DerekJ
The audio is right on the front page of OHN.

13:36:05
deedee
Yes, clear water is a good indication most of the time, but the cleansing can go in stages. (You think your cleaned out and then something else comes afterward.).

13:36:09
DerekJ
It's an mp3.

13:37:12
deedee
They are pretty picky about cleaning out for a colonoscopy and will send people home if they are not cleaned enough.  Some doctors will send you home if you tell them that you did enemas and did not take the meds. so sometimes you can't tell them unfortunately.  Do 2 days of fasting and cleansing with a series of 3 enemas per day.

13:37:36
DerekJ
Dennis, do they want you to chug a gallon of the &quot;Golitely&quot; stuff?

13:37:46
dennisr
I would love to see OHN on the Dr. Oz program. He thinks enemas are good for us. I heard him talk about it. It would surely help many people with this sometimes misunderstond subject. Let the boss know. Make sure you e-mail if ever you go on TV.

13:38:52
deedee
Kristina is always working on those things - to get us into or onto things that will promote the Center and to educate.

13:39:46
deedee
Wouldn't it be great to be on TV? 

13:39:49
Joseph
Cool, didn't know that about Dr. Oz. 

13:40:28
deedee
Yes, Dr. Oz does talk about many things that do make sense.  He thinks more preventatively, which is great.

13:40:29
DerekJ
I am on a fissure self-help email list, and every time I share my success with enemas and how it heals them, people freak out lol.

13:40:47
deedee
Freak out good or freak out bad?

13:40:57
dennisr
They want me to not only drink this junk, over a gallon of it, but take 4 pills to move my intestines harder. NO THANKS!!

13:41:00
DerekJ
They are terrified of the idea for some reason.

13:41:07
Dave
For my 2 colonscopies, I had a colonic the day before and cut back on the oral swill.  Worked well for me at least.

13:41:17
DerekJ
Ya Dennis, I feel ya, that stuff is NASTY!

13:41:24
deedee
Welcome, Phil!  

13:42:05
deedee
What is it about natural, preventative therapies that gets the medical community all riled up?  I think we know...

13:42:18
DerekJ
Yes, I think we do...

13:42:20
phil w
A little late but here.

13:42:42
DerekJ
I feel sorry for those suffering in pain, but no sense twisting their arm.

13:42:53
Joseph
I think  we do...

13:43:09
dennisr
Not only drink that crap, but drink one 8-oz glass of it every 10 minutes until it's gone!

13:43:20
DerekJ
Been there, done that..

13:43:36
deedee
Dennis, I think you would do fine to eliminate the nasty drink and do your enemas a couple days in a row like you know how to do so well, and do 2 days of fasting prior to your prep.  This has always worked well for all I've worked with.

13:45:06
DerekJ
I know a little olive oil in the solution really gets things moving for me.

13:45:26
deedee
I have not had my first colonoscopy yet.  When I do, I will be taking the natural approach.  The drink they give you is hard on the kidneys and nervous system, and getting the stuff out of your system afterwards is important too.

13:45:26
DerekJ
Sounds like solid advice there, Dennis

13:45:54
DerekJ
not to mention it's gross to get down.

13:46:48
deedee
Poppajoe and Sandy, do you have any questions or concerns to bring up?

13:47:22
DerekJ
DeeDee, something my CT had me do was put castor oil on my stomach before my session to help &quot;detox.&quot; Not sure if that is any benefit.

13:47:32
dennisr
I've decided to fast with liquids only 2 days before the test and enemas twice a day each day. I agree with you, DeeDee, that these so called doctors don't understand that there are other ways of handling something like this. I will sure let everyone know in August.

13:47:59
DerekJ
What are they looking for, Dennis?

13:48:10
deedee
Yes, castor oil in a pack topically on the abdomen can be very helpful in moving waste out of the body.

13:48:31
DerekJ
OK, good to know. Thanks, DeeDee.

13:48:39
deedee
That sounds like a good plan, Dennis.

13:49:57
deedee
We have been busy working on mixing herbs for adrenals and I will next be working on a mixture of herbs/oils for constipation.  I will let you know when I get that going.

13:50:19
DerekJ
That's awesome, DeeDee.

13:51:27
DerekJ
DeeDee, I have been considering one of the delrin nozzles, but anything large seems to aggravate my fissure down there. Can they damage the fissure site?

13:51:32
Joseph
Have not had my first colonoscopy yet either, but when I do, I want to try the natural approach.

13:51:57
deedee
It amazes me that so many people are living with constipation and some don't even realize it.

13:52:07
Dave
Do you plan to ask for volunteers or do self-testing too?

13:52:58
dennisr
This is my first TOTAL  inspection of my colon. I have NO problems with anything. Doctor just want to make sure I`m O.K. at 71 yrs old. I'll bet him, I have NO polyps or abnormal problems. I'm taking enemas now for 63 years.

13:53:18
deedee
The white delrin nozzles are smaller and very smooth, so they actually are less irritating than the ones that have side holes.  Of course, you still need to be very careful when inserting.

13:53:33
DerekJ
Yeah, I would be shocked if they found anything.

13:53:51
Dave
That may be because MDs pay little attention to constipation now as opposed to earlier years. Enemas too.

13:54:16
DerekJ
OK, the 3/4&quot; diameter gave me pause as to if that is a good idea.

13:54:41
deedee
I do not have constipation issues, so I would rely on the feedback I get from my clients.  Of course everyone is so different, so what works for one person may not for the next person.

13:54:48
deedee
That is why I want to attempt this as an alternative approach to what is already available.

13:54:54
DerekJ
I currently use the 32Fr silicone nozzle that came in my kit.

13:55:36
DerekJ
I think I have a slow transit time, causing constipation.

13:55:40
deedee
Is that colon tube irritating?

13:56:01
DerekJ
Not really. I use lots of salve and coconut oil to help.

13:56:14
Joseph
What kind of salve, Derek?

13:56:19
DerekJ
Super Salve

13:56:26
DerekJ
It came in my kit from you.

13:56:42
DerekJ
I have the 2 qt can kit.

13:56:45
deedee
Yes, sluggish colon and slow transit time is what I want to target with this herb/oil mixture.  Let's get that peristalsis working again without the use of the stimulating herbs that you can only use briefly.

13:56:58
Joseph
OK. Thank you, Derek.

13:57:17
deedee
You could stick with that tube as long as it is working well for you.

13:58:07
DerekJ
So far so good!  I started with a basic combo kit before I committed to enemas.

13:58:12
dennisr
My colon tube keeps on curling in the lower part of the colon. I can't get it to go into the first valve past the rectum.

13:58:19
Joseph
Thank you, DeeDee. Take care all.

13:59:13
deedee
Thank you, Joseph.

13:59:44
deedee
Dennis, how are you inserting it?

14:01:32
deedee
When I insert a colon tube, I lube well up about 5 in. or so.  Then when I get it up that far, I let a little trickle of water go in and I work the colon tube up farther, but slowly.

14:01:44
dennisr
Just by hand!  Curl end goes in to my back side. I tried diffenent way, but nothing.

14:02:26
deedee
Sometimes you have to spin the tube as you are going up so that it follows the natural curve. Sometimes you have to slide up and down and change positions of your body too can help.

14:02:38
dennisr
I'll try your idea.

14:02:55
deedee
Let me know how it goes.

14:03:18
deedee
Does anyone else have  a quick question or comment before we wrap up?

14:03:34
dennisr
Thanks!

14:03:43
DerekJ
Thanks for everything DeeDee!

14:03:43
Dave
Eight inches is about my limit solo. A  foot with help.

14:04:04
DerekJ
That's about my limit too. 8 in does the trick for me.

14:04:08
Dave
Good session, be well all.

14:04:24
deedee
Goodbye, Dave.

14:04:34
deedee
Thank you, Derek.

14:05:05
deedee
Goodbye and thanks everyone.

14:05:09
DerekJ
Take care everyone. Hopefully see you on the next chat.
