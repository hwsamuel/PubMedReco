Hi folks. Sorry about the late start. A hectic day today, with our cat falling off the 4th floor of our apartment building.

20:05:32
kristina
Please go ahead with questions, comments, concerns.

20:06:52
kristina
Have folks had a chance to view our new alternative health videos?

20:07:10
VinceB
Not yet.

20:07:19
Renee T
No.

20:07:28
howard
Yes, I have.

20:07:35
Connie H.
Since childhood I have had a craving for sweets.  A friend suggested that I take a series of enemas to help eliminate cravings. How often should I take the series?

20:07:36
kristina
They are informational videos of diverse health topics such as how to make essential oil suppositories and women's hormonal health.

20:07:38
Patti L
My rectum seems to be swollen for a while after enemas.  I feel like I'm sitting on a ball. Am I doing something wrong?

20:08:07
kristina
Hi Connie. Have you ever taken enemas or done any colon cleansing before?

20:08:18
Connie H.
No.

20:09:19
kristina
Patty, first I would suggest trying the lubricant Super Salve. Second, I have to ask more detail about the details of your enema practice. Can you tell me what solution you use, how many enemas you take, what nozzle you use, do you have hemorrhoids, etc?

20:10:32
kristina
Connie, my book, Ten Days to Optimal Health, is your most comprehensive resource to eliminate cravings for sweets. It is written specifically for that purpose, amongst others.

20:10:56
Connie H.
Thank you!

20:11:15
kristina
If you want to only take enemas, I recommend that you start with one.

20:11:30
Patti L
I have been colon cleansing for about 2 months now.  Am having to do them twice a day.  Had a chronic fissure and had surgery May 6th. It's doing better but doctor said I have pelvic floor dysfunction and am uncomfortable when stools start to put pressure there.

20:11:46
kristina
If that goes well, take one the next day. And so forth. 

20:11:59
kristina
You are welcome.

20:12:02
Connie H.
Got it, thanks!

20:12:30
kristina
The Super Salve will help, a lot.

20:12:47
kristina
What enema solution do you?

20:13:29
Patti L
I use a KY Jelly.  I purchased an enema kit that cost $50. It only came with one size tip.  No hemorrhoids.

20:14:21
Patti L
Filtered water with sea salt.

20:14:46
kristina
Solution sounds good. Use a therapeutic lubricant.

20:15:08
Connie H.
Would you recommend the castile soap enema or the coffee enema or both?

20:15:30
Patti L
Will that keep the swelling down? It also takes a while to completely empty out because of swelling.  I do sitz baths also before and after enemas for 5 minutes each time.

20:17:32
VinceB
Kristina, what is the shelf life of Super Salve?

20:17:34
kristina
Any of our soaps work as stimulants to assist the colon to clear out more fully.

20:18:04
kristina
The coffee enemas are to assist the liver with its detoxification capacities.

20:18:12
kristina
People often use both.

20:18:24
kristina
Good question, Vince.

20:18:32
razoriowa
The goat's milk soap is really good.

20:18:35
kristina
Not sure. Is there a stamp on the SS container?

20:18:42
VinceB
Nope.

20:18:47
kristina
But use it all the time and they last for months. 

20:18:58
kristina
And, yet, there are oils in the salve, which do go rancid.

20:19:00
VinceB
OK.

20:19:08
razoriowa
I don't think it's an issue. I have some over a year old and no change in materials.

20:20:00
kristina
Smell it. If it is rancid, it will have a strong, unpleasant smell. It doesn't originally.

20:20:00
mara a
Is it important to use a certain coffee in a coffee enema?

20:20:26
VinceB
Again, thanks.

20:20:41
mara a
I used an organic coffee from Whole Foods. Is that OK? 

20:20:41
kristina
Ideally, yes, as an enema coffee is higher in the therapeutic ingredients caffeine and palmitates. 

20:20:46
razoriowa
The company has a website and does not list a expiration status, but I could ask them.

20:21:15
mara a
Which company?

20:21:38
kristina
I have a lot of educational materials on www.optimalhealthnetwork.com and www.enemabag.com regarding coffee enemas, including an informative radio interview.

20:21:45
mara a
Thanks.

20:21:52
kristina
www.supersalve.com

20:22:12
razoriowa
Just search under Super Salve.They are out of Arizona. Do not have web info with me.

20:22:14
kristina
Yes, it is okay, just not as therapeutic.

20:22:51
Patti L
Will Super Salve help with the swelling? Is that what you mean by therapeutic lubricant?

20:24:28
kristina
Yes and yes.

20:26:28
razoriowa
How much essential oil per quart should be used?

20:27:06
kristina
I usually suggest 2-4 drops per quart but that can vary with the type of oil.

20:27:20
VinceB
The coffee you sell, Kristina, seems to work the best over the retail stores that sell organic coffee.  Is it the palmitates that makes the difference?

20:27:24
razoriowa
Peppermint or lavendar normally.

20:27:25
kristina
The other alternative health videos we now have are Optimizing Digestive Health,

20:27:53
kristina
The REAL Tonic, A Runner's Testimonial, Tired All The Time?,

kristina
7-Day Cleanse, Men's Health, Constipation Cures,

kristina
and Echinacea for Immune and Gut Support.

20:28:52
Connie H.
How much solution does the average adult retain?  When I begin the daily enema series how long should I continue with the practice?

20:28:56
happy b
You recently mentioned geranium oil.  Can it be used like peppermint and lavender?

20:29:23
kristina
Yes, the palmitates do make a tremendous difference on the effect of a coffee enema in our enema coffee.

20:30:16
VinceB
Good discussion.  Later.

20:30:17
Patti L
Is there a cure for pelvic floor dysfunction?

20:30:18
kristina
Vince, can you describe the difference you notice?

20:31:03
kristina
Most people can take 2-4 quarts of enema solution.

20:32:06
kristina
Connie, your body is the best judge of how long and how much. With that said, the hair tissue mineral analysis is the best tool to determine individual colon cleansing frequency.

20:32:14
VinceB
The over the counter coffee is more harsh on my system; your coffee seems to be less irritating and more relaxing if that makes any sense.

20:32:53
kristina
Yes, it is air-roasted, which makes it easier to take and has less of the harsher acids in it.

20:32:55
Connie H.
Thanks for generously giving of your time and talent.  It is appreciated.

20:33:13
VinceB
Good night all.

20:33:14
razoriowa
Any issues using water in the 110 degree range?

20:33:17
kristina
You are very welcome, Connie. Thank you for joining us.

20:33:22
kristina
Good night, Vince.

20:34:20
razoriowa
I find the warmer helps with my capacity and retention.

20:34:48
kristina
110 degrees is going to be too warm for some. I don't think it will burn anyone but feel the temperature of the water with your finger. If it is warm but not at all hot, the temperature is fine. Usually, the warmer the enema water, the more solution the body can take.

20:35:54
susan w
I had soreness, and tried a tea made from boiling flax seed meal (as you do with the coffee) and adding the resulting strained fluid to water for my first enema. (I do coffee second.) It seemed to minimize cramps.

20:35:57
razoriowa
Will use temperature check and fingers as well.

20:36:32
kristina
Geranium is known for its healing effects on the skin.

20:36:45
Patti L
Will enemas help with pelvic floor dysfunction?

20:36:58
kristina
Geranium is used as a stabilizing influence, calming both the mind and body.

20:37:13
Larry
Sorry for joining late.  I have a question about probiotics and antibiotics when you get a chance.  I'm on massive antibiotics for a spider bite for the last 2 weeks.  On the 3rd day I started the Ortho probiotics and it's helped the problems!  Should I t

20:37:18
kristina
It is thought to restore balance and to bring the emotions back to a more relaxing level.

20:37:44
susan w
Kristina, I saw that the pump can help with cramps. I have had enemas with very little cramping and then I get a lot of cramps. Can hardly hold coffee for 5 minutes. It changes. What do you think makes it so different each time?

20:37:58
kristina
As with all oil used in the colon, test a small amount first and then build up to the suggested 2-4 drops per quart.

20:38:16
kristina
You can call the office any time and we can answer individual questions about essential oils, too.

20:38:19
Larry
(cont'd) Should I take the probiotic at a different time from the antibiotic?

20:38:32
kristina
Hi Larry. No problem.

20:39:06
happy b
Thank you.

20:39:12
susan w
What are the best things to do to minimize cramping?

20:39:14
kristina
Enemas can help with pelvic floor dysfunction. Depends what the cause is and what else you do to improve the situation.

20:39:44
kristina
Susan, do you have IBS or cramping of the colon in other situations?

20:39:54
razoriowa
I find a slow fill rate keeps cramps down.  The pump with bag low makes this easy.

20:40:00
kristina
Yikes, a spider bite. Sorry about that. 

20:40:11
kristina
I have a blog post about spider bites that you might enjoy reading.

20:40:19
kristina
Also, take enemas at least once a day.

20:40:26
susan w
Thanks, Kristina, no other cramping. I have had stomach upsets with cramps of this sort all my life though. 

20:40:41
kristina
Larry, your question about probiotics isn't complete.

20:40:50
Patti L
Doctor says it's from having babies and being over 50. Nothing with my bowel function is normal. Am using your book and getting eating under control.

20:41:30
susan w
Slow fill to minimize cramping, I know. Once a day, was that directed to my question? I did find that I had less cramps and then skipped a day and then had a lot.

20:42:28
kristina
Yes, Susan, the smooth flow syringes or just a rubber bulb adding to enema hose will diminish cramping.

20:42:51
kristina
Also, sea salt in the enema solutions helps a lot of people to reduce cramping as do certain essential oils.

20:43:17
razoriowa
How much sea salt per quart?

20:43:24
susan w
Which oils? I am trying to avoid salt in my diet. I have high BP and it helps to eat little salt. So I didn't try adding salt. 

20:43:49
kristina
Once a day for clearing out the toxins from the spider bite and the unhealthy bacteria that can overpopulate the colon with antibiotic use.

20:44:29
kristina
What are your symptoms of pelvic floor dysfunction?

20:45:12
kristina
Given what you say, Susan, taking a daily enema sounds like a solid option at this point.

20:45:35
kristina
Try a drop or two of peppermint oil per quart of water, also.

20:45:47
kristina
One teaspoon per quart

20:45:49
kristina
of sea salt.

20:46:52
susan w
Thanks so much. I am going to get a smooth flow. I needed some support as the days go by, because daily enemas seem like some sort of hang-up. I know they are helping me, though. I have also changed my diet, mainly vegan, low salt and very low fat. 

20:47:06
kristina
For all of you, check out our new essential oil suppositories. They really do wonders for lots of conditions. If you need help determing which oils, give us a call.

20:47:09
Patti L
Stools come down almost to evacuation but no feeling of need to go. Also, incomplete evacuation when I do go. That is what started the fissure...unable to empty. Now, when I push to go, nothing happens.

20:47:12
Larry
How long after stopping the antibiotics will I need the probiotics?  The rest of my earlier question was about time frame for taking the probiotic vs antibiotic. Same time or separate times?

20:47:26
kristina
Well done, Susan!

20:47:55
kristina
You would do very well, Patti, with a suppository regime.

20:48:23
Patti L
Should I give you a call, or is there something on your website I can purchase?

20:48:28
razoriowa
Good night all.

20:48:37
kristina
Larry, at least a month, as long as you have no symptoms of intestinal upset.

20:48:55
susan w
Thank you! I am finally seeing improvement. It is a serious committment but the small improvements push me along. I am certain that it all comes down to toxicity and deficiency. 

20:49:14
kristina
I'd call and talk to DeeDee tomorrow about your situation so we can set you up with an individualized program of essential oil suppositories.

20:49:20
carl w
I just ordered essential oils for my prostate issues. When is the best time to take the suppositories?

20:49:30
kristina
We do have a lot of written material and videos so you can start there.

20:50:03
Patti L
Will do.  Thanks so much!

20:50:13
kristina
And, of course, there is a tremendous amount written about essential oils all over the web so with enough research, you can just order but why not have a little help thinking about it?

20:50:34
kristina
At bedtime is the best time to take suppositories for most people.

20:51:06
kristina
Have I missed anything? With my kitten in trauma, I am a bit busy here.

20:51:36
Larry
Timing of the probiotic vs antibiotic?

20:51:45
Connie H.
Does that time frame of bedtime apply to enemas as well?

20:52:17
carl w
Should a suppository be retained all night, or is an hour or two OK?

20:53:51
kristina
Retain suppository as long as it will stay in you. They are often fully absorbed and the only sign of them is an easier bowel movement in them morning. What do you find, Carl?

20:54:25
kristina
I think it is best to do enemas in the morning, but it really depends on when the most relaxed time is for the person taking the enemas.

20:54:40
carl w
I am waiting for my shipment of essential oils from DeeDee.

20:54:54
kristina
Finish antibiotics, take probiotics now and for at least a month after you finish.

20:55:46
kristina
Carl, can you tell us what essential oils you will be using?

20:56:09
kristina
Next live chat, Wednesday, August 24th at 12 noon with DeeDee Delkamp.

20:56:10
Larry
My question is...do I take the two together or do I need to space them apart from each other?

20:56:24
susan w
Thanks everyone and Kristina. I am re-inspired. 

20:56:36
kristina
Welcome, Jackie. Just closing up here in 4 minutes so please let me know asap if you have any questions or concerns or comments.

20:56:44
kristina
Yeah, Susan!!

20:56:51
carl w
I am not sure. DeeDee has made up a personalized blend for my prostate issues. 

20:57:23
jackie
No, just wanted to see what everyone is talking about.

20:57:35
kristina
Taking care of our bodies these ways - using the oils, therapeutic diets, colon cleansing- really does pay off with better health, more energy, less pain, etc.

20:57:44
kristina
Great. Again, welcome.

20:57:53
kristina
Keep us posted, Carl.

20:57:55
Patti L
I'm waiting for the answer to Larry's question also.

20:58:19
kristina
Take the antibiotic and probiotic and two different times of the day.

20:58:30
Larry
Thank you!

20:58:50
kristina
You are welcome. Thanks everyone for joining me tonight. I am honored.

20:59:02
Patti L
Thanks for your help!

Hi Howard. Just closing. Any last minute thoughts or questions?
