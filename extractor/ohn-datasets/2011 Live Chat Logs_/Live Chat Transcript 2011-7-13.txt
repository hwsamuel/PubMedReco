Hello Kristina.

19:56:52
Stephen
Hello.

20:02:36
kristina
Hello everyone. I am pleased that you joined me this evening. 

20:02:49
kristina
Feel free to post your questions, comments and concerns.

20:03:24
Stephen
Kristina, did you receive my email today?

20:03:42
kristina
I sit here at my desk drinking a kombucha and eating blue corn chips dipped in garlicy hummus. I would enjoy hearing what each of you have done for your health today.

20:03:57
randyu
Are benefiber tablets good for IBS and colon health?

20:04:11
kristina
Hi Stephen. I received many emails today. Can you give me a synopsis of the content?

20:04:23
Larry
I rode 41 miles on my bike... without a single cramp!

20:04:27
randyu
I take fiber tabs and they seem to help.

20:04:28
kristina
I have not heard of benefiber. What is in them?

20:04:51
kristina
Wow, Larry! Well done! Where did you ride?

20:04:59
EdK
Thank you, Kristina, for the opportunity. I'm wondering about the differences between doing a colon cleanse using something like Oxypowder versus an enema?

20:05:07
randyu
Natural fiber, not like psyllium in metamucil.

20:05:11
kristina
Good question, Ed.

20:05:34
Larry
South of Rockford and Cherry Valley and over to Belvidere.

20:05:41
Stephen
I have a spinal cord injury (paralysis) and the neurogenic bowel comes with it. I need assistance in putting together an enema kit that replicates one that is marketed for people with paralyis, but better made.

20:05:53
randyu
Ed, good point.

20:06:23
joe2
Hi Kristina.     To improve matters, I've taken my 6 oz. of Tillamook Yogurt... Yummy.

20:06:29
Stephen
Probably something that would be more productively discussed outside of this chat.

20:07:29
kristina
Oxypowder, in my opinion, is an expensive form of magnesium, which does work to empty the bowels.

20:07:30
Larry
Suggestion... Put Ancient Minerals in your products for sale.  It's just plain amazing!

20:08:06
joans
I've been using a 4-qt. bag for about six months.  But I'm not getting good results.  Everything seems to make me constipated, including dairy.

20:09:16
EdK
Hmm, interesting. It seemed to work but am not sure if it did the job or not, if you know what I mean. I bought an enema kit but haven't started that yet as I had some intestinal problems due to some antiobiotics I took...

20:10:32
EdK
Guess I looked for the quick fix. Kind of the American way I suppose... :)

20:11:31
kristina
The body has what is called a &quot;bowel tolerance&quot; for magnesium, so when you take &quot;too much,&quot; which is different for everybody, you will empty out the colon.

20:11:50
kristina
Beautiful ride, eh, Larry?

20:12:25
kristina
Stephen, I forwarded the email to DeeDee, who works with such issues, but let's work on it now.

20:12:41
Larry
Since I've gotten a handle on my hypothyroidism, riding is sooooo much easier.

20:13:13
kristina
Larry, we do offer the Ancient Minerals. I have tried it but haven't seen results. Sam, a fabulous massage therapist in our office, swears by it. 

20:13:20
kristina
How much do you use?

20:13:38
kristina
And, what have you done to get your hypothyroidism under control?

20:13:56
Larry
I picked it up from you on my last visit.  A couple of sprays and any cramping vanishes.

20:15:08
kristina
Wow! That is great! Was the cramping a big issue for you?

20:15:42
Larry
DeeDee has me on Pituitrophin, Hypothalmex, and REAL.  Being the curious guy that I am, I'm trying to read everything I can on the supps.  What is in the REAL and why does it work?

20:15:46
randyu
Wheat dextrin is in Benefiber tablets, Kristina. Is that good?

20:15:52
kristina
Ed, magnesium is useful. I just think the Oxypowder is overpriced.

20:16:04
Stephen
It consists of a 1L reservoir bag, rectal catheter w/inflatable cuff, and a squeeze pump to instill water into the colon.

20:16:09
Stephen
I'm using a product called the Peristeen.

20:16:28
Larry
Cramping was a BIG issue!

20:16:32
kristina
And, I feel that overdosing something to the point of causing the bowels to dump on a regular basis isn't in balance with the harmonic designs of the body.

20:16:52
kristina
I myself find my bowels work more fully taking regular magnesium.

20:17:21
joans
Do you mean magnesium citrate?

20:17:21
Stephen
It works as advertised -- as part of my bowel management program -- but I don't feel that the components are well-made and it's quite expensive.

20:17:45
kristina
I use Ortho Molecular's Reacted Magnesium, which is much more economically priced and I don't dose so high that I get any &quot;irritation&quot; to the bowel.

20:17:59
Stephen
I would like to find a comparable enema kit that works nearly identically.

20:18:17
joe2
Kristina, I'd like a comment on my 2 part enema routine every 5-6 days... First I just use 48 oz. of plain distilled water at 100 degrees and a gentle massage empties me out within 5 minutes... then within 15 minutes I use 32 oz. of distilled water at 100 degrees with a teaspoon of Celtic sea salt (dissolved) and 4 drops of lavender oil, which I hold for 20 minutes... This last recipe requires a lot of massage to get the peristalsis going.... Do you suggest anything else?

20:18:31
kristina
An enema simply washes out the contents of the colon, without imbalancing mineral levels, especially when used in combination with sea salt and seasonal hair tissue mineral analysis.

20:19:07
bridgetc
Consuming sea salt or in enema?

20:19:30
Stephen
You can find it by doing a search at the Coloplast website.

20:19:38
kristina
Given so many people are gluten-intolerant, I would never recommend wheat dextrin as a fiber supplement. Ground flax, carrots, or an apple or two a day are much better choices.

20:20:38
randyu
What happens when you are gluten-intolerant, Kristina?

20:20:41
kristina
We have a new YouTube video available on our herbal tonic, R.E.A.L.

20:20:45
EdK
So the enema doesn't really effect the healthy bacteria in the colon? Probably a silly question...

20:20:55
kristina
Our YouTube video on Men's Health also discusses R.E.A.L.

20:21:46
kristina
R.E.A.L stands for Rehmannis, Echinacea, Ashwaganda and Licorice. In the July newsletter, I will introduce R.E.A.L in more detail.

20:22:18
randyu
I know that one specialist (MD) does not recommend enemas for constipation or IBS.

20:22:41
kristina
After years of clinical work and research, we formulated it with another herbalist across the country because of its overall healing and rebuilding properties.

20:22:44
joans
What if nothing else relieves the constipation?

20:23:06
kristina
It works on the immune system, the glandular system, as a tonic for overall health.

20:23:11
EdK
Sounds real good... :)

20:23:28
randyu
If the bowel is really impacted then do the enema.

20:23:33
kristina
It is excellent for recovering from bowel troubles, adrenal fatigue, and thyroid issues.

20:23:43
Larry
Nope... Taste is terrible but it sure seems to work.

20:23:59
kristina
Ed, not a silly question at all, regarding the healthy bacteria in the colon.

20:24:47
kristina
From my reading, the healthy bacteria, unless they are on their way out, reside in the tissues and mucus of the colon in such a way that they are not at risk of being washed out by enemas.

20:25:09
EdK
I use this really powerful probiotic Grainsfield (from Australia). A little pricey but very good and also use the probiotics from this site. That's good news. It was a concern...

20:25:56
Stephen
Go to www.coloplast.com and enter Peristeen in their search window to get the specifics of this product.

20:26:11
kristina
Stool has healthy and unhealthy bacteria in it, so a flow out is normal. I have it from many medical doctors that water washes (enemas) are always a better choice than laxatives.

20:26:13
randyu
I think the ready-to-do enemas like Fleet work OK too.  There are different types depending on what you need them for.

20:26:19
Larry
FYI...I have found a source of raw milk for anyone in the northern IL area of DeKalb.

20:26:37
Stephen
I think this is too off-topic for the purpose of this chat.

20:27:04
bridgetc
Any insight regarding gas after doing an enema?

20:27:16
mandyh
If you struggle with constipation and use an enema every day, can that make one dependent on the enema?

20:28:26
kristina
Stephen, I see the product.

20:29:37
randyu
Kristina, I defer to you to answer the questions on the enemas.  You know more about this topic.

20:30:05
kristina
Stephen, the nozzle is either the 520 or the 528, depending on how much you want to spend.

20:30:21
kristina
Then you will want the Silicone Smooth Flow.

20:30:39
EdK
Wonder why there seems to be a stigma on using enemas? My own assessment is that it's simply ignorance. That was certainly true of me...

20:30:42
kristina
Might I recommend one of our stainless steel enema cans, with an appropriate length of silicone tubing?

20:31:08
Stephen
A can would be OK for home use, but not for travel.

20:31:13
kristina
I just wrote a lovely blog post today about an ad in the Saturday Evening Post selling enema bags. Look for it in the next day or two.

20:31:24
joe2
Kristina, Question #2:    One thing I've noticed after my 2-enema routine is that if I eat 1-3 hours after I do my routine, I get a slight tummy ache... so I now do my routine just before going to sleep.   Is that normal?

20:31:52
kristina
Call DeeDee tomorrow if you have questions that we don't answer tonight and she can help you set up your system.

20:32:01
kristina
I am sure that we have what you are looking for.

20:32:19
Stephen
OK, is there a best time to reach her?

20:33:13
mandyh
If you struggle with constipation and use an enema every day, can that make one dependent on the enema?

20:34:03
kristina
9:10 CT or 11:30 to 12:15 or 2ish is what it looks like to me. I just sent her an email letting her know what I have recommended.

20:35:10
kristina
Mandy, I have not seen physical dependency in my 12 years of being a colon hydrotherapist, but everyone's situation is very unique, so before I recommend daily enemas, I prefer to know more details.

20:35:21
joe2
 Kristina,   any comments/suggestions on my weekly routine?

20:35:28
Stephen
Thanks!

20:36:04
mandyh
What kind of details?

20:36:41
kristina
Why the person feels the need to use daily enemas... How often the bowel empties without a colon cleanse...

20:36:46
kristina
Diet...

20:37:19
kristina
Joe, sorry, to you now, except did I address Question #1 because I don't see it.

20:37:47
kristina
Re question #2, so if you don't eat, you don't get a tummy ache?

20:38:04
kristina
How long do you have to not eat to not get a tummy ache, other than all night?

20:38:15
kristina
Have you tried using sea salt with your enema solutions?

20:38:23
mandyh
I have never been regular (every day); more like every 3 to 4 days and now I am pregnant so for some reason it is worse and I feel so sick to my stomach. When I do the enemas I feel so much better. 

20:39:06
kristina
Because of the rise in progesterone during pregnancy, where all the muscles in the body relax more, constipation is a common issue with pregnancy.

20:39:26
kristina
Due to liability, it is tricky to advise pregnant women.

20:39:37
mandyh
I understand.

20:39:44
kristina
However, I would trust your experience of what you need to do to feel better.

20:39:56
mandyh
Thanks.

20:40:12
kristina
Also, I personally know many women who take regular enemas throughout pregnancy with excellent results. Constipation is especially hard on the body during pregnancy.

20:40:41
Larry
Is there a recommended interval for doing the Vit-Ra-Tox 5-day cleanse... i.e., how many times per year?

20:41:05
kristina
Four is a general recommendation.

20:41:27
kristina
Some people will benefit from up to six times a year.

20:41:41
joe2
I usually used to eat/drink a smoothie 1-3 hours after a weekly routine... Beyond 3 hours I had no tummy ache.    But again, I do my weekly routine before bed time and that's working out fine.

20:42:06
joans
I've tried doing some implants, like probiotics, but I haven't had much luck.  It seems like the solution just stays in the tubing no matter what I do.  Any suggestions?

20:43:12
Larry
I highly recommend your HHH program as a &quot;reward&quot; for completion of the cleanse.

20:43:33
kristina
Thanks, Larry. Will you tell folks what the HHH is?

20:44:03
kristina
Bedtime sounds like a great solution to me.

20:44:26
kristina
I would love to see all of you on our FB page. That way, we can converse more often.

20:44:37
kristina
Also, our Twitter feed has useful daily tips.

20:44:53
joe2
Kristina,   yes  I use a teaspoon of Celtic Salt  in my 2nd enema and also use 4 drops of lavender oil which I hold for 20 minutes... This  2nd enema requires lots of massage to get to water out, which is almost clear.

20:45:08
Larry
Healing Hands (massage), Healing Heat (FIR sauna), and Healing Waters (colonic or enema session).

20:45:36
kristina
FB is Optimal Health Network.

20:45:41
kristina
Twitter is Kris Amelong.

20:45:48
kristina
There are links to both on our home page.

20:45:50
EdK
FIR? is that infrared?

20:46:01
Larry
Yes.

20:46:11
EdK
Okay, thanks...

20:47:30
kristina
Thank you, Larry.

20:48:01
kristina
Joan, what equipment do you use for the implant process? We do have an implant syringe.

20:49:20
kristina
It is a medical grade 2-oz. syringe with a catheter tip with an attached 10- inch silicone colon tube.

20:50:03
kristina
Larry, thank you for all you have shared tonight. I really appreciate it. 

20:50:31
kristina
If you are up for more, might you share what health struggles you were having that brought you to the Optimal Health Center?

20:50:45
Larry
Happy to contribute.  OHN has helped me a bunch.  It's the best I've felt in years.

20:52:17
kristina
Next Live Chat is Wednesday, July 27th at 12 noon with DeeDee Delkamp.

20:52:38
Larry
I thought I was suffering from lead exposure and have been fighting what I thought was hypothyroidism for years due to the loss of half my thyroid.  My endocronoligist keeps telling me that all of my blood tests are fine and I didn't have a problem.

20:52:49
kristina
Did anyone happen to see my blog post about giving cats and dogs enemas?

20:53:08
kristina
What symptoms have you struggled with?

20:53:33
kristina
Welcome, Emmettb. Anything you would like to share tonight?

20:53:52
kristina
Hello J.P.

20:53:55
Larry
Fatigue, cramping, and cold.

20:54:15
J.P.
All the best to you!  I've followed your progress and am very impressed!

20:54:29
kristina
All these symptoms are gone, Larry?

20:54:43
kristina
Well, coming from you, that is saying a lot. It is great to have a hello from you.

20:55:10
kristina
Of course, you are the &quot;grandfather&quot; of Optimal Health Network and EnemaBag.com

20:55:35
Larry
Yes, and my energy level is at a new high with recovery time quicker than ever for heavy workouts... and I'm 66.

20:55:36
J.P.
You're too kind. I'll keep in better touch!

20:55:54
joans
Yes, I am using the syringe.  I push the handle  into the syringe and the solution goes into the tubing and stays there.  I wish I was closer to WI!

20:56:06
J.P.
My warmest regards and compliments to your staff, too!

20:56:08
kristina
I love my work and all that creating these business has done for my life. They are truly tremendous gifts.

20:56:18
kristina
Thank you, J.P.

20:56:29
kristina
Me too, Joans.

20:56:35
J.P.
You are the gift, Kris. Think well of yourselves.  Love, JP

20:56:40
kristina
What are you using in the syringe?

20:56:47
emmettb
Hi Kris. I am looking for a water temp thermometer.

20:57:05
kristina
You can refill the syringe after the first plunge.

20:57:35
joans
Probiotics.

20:58:14
Larry
Joan... I started using the same setup for implants but found that just a small squeeze syringe worked better... like one for infants.

20:58:44
joans
Maybe that's what I should try.

20:58:55
joans
Thanks.

21:00:14
kristina
An infant bulb syringe is a good suggestion. DeeDee has also discovered a method where you use coconut oil in ice cube trays with the essential oils. Free the tray full of implants and use them as suppositories.

21:01:00
kristina
Good night and thank you to all of you for spending some of life's precious time with me.

21:01:07
Larry
Yup... that's the one I use now.  I sent her some info on a tube-type ice cube tray that I found at Walmart.

21:01:24
kristina
She is recommending it to everyone now, Larry. Well done. 

21:01:34
kristina
I have to go now. Take care.

21:01:41
joans
Thanks.

21:01:48
Larry
Thanks for all the info tonight and have a great week.

21:01:56
emmettb
Bye Kris.
