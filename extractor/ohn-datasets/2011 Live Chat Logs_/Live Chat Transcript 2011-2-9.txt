Welcome to all. I am pleased that you are here. Feel free to share any questions, comments, or stories you have about health, wellness, your process, the colon cleanse, diet, and more. If you haven't yet joined us on Twitter, you will find us at www.twitter.com/krisamelong

Kristina
Welcome, Sharon.

19:59:22
Kristina
Hyperactivity of the immune system, which is the first stages of autoimmune disease,

20:00:19
Kristina
is one of the reasons that regular colon cleansing offers excellent health benefits to many of us.

20:01:52
Kristina
Infection and infestation (parasites) in the colon are much more common than is commonly thought.

20:02:00
Sharon M
Praise the Lord, Kristina. First time ever to chat. Since talking about autoimmune disease, what can you tell me about lichen planus?

20:02:19
Kristina
Welcome!

20:03:25
Kristina
Lichen planus is a skin disease that can last for months or years.

20:03:58
Kristina
The onset of lichen planus can be gradual or sudden.

20:04:13
Kristina
There are many theories as to why it occurs:

20:04:34
Kristina
stress, genetics, infection, autoimmune issue

20:05:07
Sharon M
Husband taking pregnozone for lichens. He took a medicine for high blood pressure

20:05:34
Sharon M
and broke out with lichens.

20:06:03
Kristina
I consider all of these causes to really be one and the same. The immune system is attacking itself.

20:07:16
Sharon M
So what would be the main supplements to rebuild immune system?

20:08:06
Kristina
Your husband's situation is classic example of an auto immune disease presenting itself after taking a pharmaceutical drug.

20:08:43
Kristina
Sharon, that is an excellent question, but not a straightforward one. 

20:08:57
Kristina
But, let's begin with some general concepts.

20:09:15
Sharon M
okay

20:10:05
Kristina
One goal is to assist the body to be free of as many of the irritants that are causing the immune system to be hyperactive, right?

20:10:25
Sharon M
yes

20:11:01
Kristina
Well, since I know so little about him, I ask you, what are his obvious challenges to his immune system?

20:11:21
Kristina
Immune challenges that are common to so many of us are:

20:11:32
Kristina
low vitamin D levels

20:11:37
Kristina
not enough sleep

20:11:42
Kristina
hormonal imbalance

20:11:46
Kristina
poor digestion

20:11:52
Kristina
stress

20:12:17
Kristina
parasites and/or intestinal infections

20:12:26
Kristina
improper gut flora levels

20:12:45
Kristina
eating foods that one is allergic to

20:13:02
Sharon M
So his would be vitamin D, stress, sluggish bowels

20:13:31
Kristina
Ok, so this is obviously a process, right? He could start by testing his vitamin D level and taking vitamin D. 

20:14:02
Kristina
He could also begin taking a weekly enema series or using a bowel tonic such as Colax from Standard Process.

20:15:29
Kristina
On any quest to improve one's health, I always recommend giving up gluten foods, dairy, sugar and excess carbohydrates for 30 days. You can find detail on this in my book, Ten Days to Optimal Health

20:15:53
Sharon M
Started him on 5000mg vitamin D for one month, then to 1000 daily 

20:16:19
Kristina
I would make sure he doesn't have prostatitis, as this can shift a body into immune dysregulation.

20:16:31
Kristina
Fabulous idea.

20:16:45
Kristina
It is important to check his levels at your doctor's office.

20:16:56
Kristina
Or, you can get a vitamin D test kit from our office.

20:18:02
Sharon M
Doctor did tell him to take vitamin D but not how much. Just heard about the high dose first month mainly because of Illinois.

20:18:22
Kristina
Now that we have hinted at the work to be done to remove irritants to the immune system, we can speak to &quot;boosting&quot; the immune system:

20:18:41
Kristina
I always start with garlic!

20:19:49
howard
Hello, I am sorry that I am late.

20:20:23
Sharon M
Plus a probiotic.

20:20:51
Kristina
Boswellia, as in MediHerbs Boswellia Complex, because of the anti-inflammatory effects of the boswellic acids. They have been shown clinically to be as effective as pharmaceutical anti-inflammatory drugs.

20:21:12
Kristina
Welcome, Howard. You are just in time. Please do share with us when the spirit moves you.

20:22:45
Kristina
Echinacea because you want destroy any infections or parasites that may be involved.

20:22:48
howard
I bought orthobiotic. Is same as probiotic?

20:23:04
Sharon M
So would that help to reduce the pregnezone as we boost the immune system?

20:23:21
Kristina
Rehmannia to dampen down and balance the immune dysregulation.

20:23:38
Kristina
Modification of bowel flora, which I would do with the help of a stool analysis.

20:24:04
Kristina
Do you mean prednisone?

20:24:19
Kristina
We offer two different types of stool tests.

20:25:36
Kristina
There are so many different organisms that may be causing the irritation to the body. It is important to target for the exact types of organisms. For instance, I have had numerous clients completely surprised to find out they had c. difficile infections.

20:25:38
Sharon M
Yes, prednisone. Does it affect the liver?

20:26:04
Kristina
They had been fighting irritable bowel issues, crohn's disease, celiac disease sorts of issues for years without full healing.

20:26:26
Sharon M
What stool test would you suggest?

20:26:38
Kristina
Upon discovering and treating the c. difficile infection, they all have been able to fully recover their health.

20:26:49
Kristina
These gut issues are all autoimmune conditions.

20:27:26
Kristina
Prednisone is EXTREMELY hard on the body.

20:27:41
razoriowa
Will the use of periodic enemas upset bowel balance?

20:27:49
Kristina
It is important not to use prednisone if at all possible and use it for the shortest amount of time when it is needed.

20:28:32
Kristina
No, the periodic use of quality enemas will not upset the bowel flora balance.

20:28:47
Kristina
The healthy bowel empties at least once daily.

20:29:56
Dave
Should probiotics be implanted after enema series?

20:30:01
Kristina
Adding water, healthy soaps, essential oils, quality coffee to the bowels at regular intervals only supports healthy flora levels within the colon.

20:30:56
Sharon M
Down to 20mg daily. Any lower, blisters on lip break out and very hard to heal.

20:31:52
Sharon M
So no probiotics. What are these soaps and oils?

20:32:32
razoriowa
I use lavender and peppermint oils.

20:33:01
razoriowa
Goat's milk soap also from OHN.

20:33:13
Kristina
Well, if he does the work that I have laid out, he ought to be able to come off the prednisone completely.

20:33:30
Kristina
The most serious side effect of staying on the prednisone is bone loss.

20:33:58
Kristina
As you know, prednisone just covers up the disease. It does not cure the disease.

20:34:14
Sharon M
I know.

20:34:20
Kristina
I would also have his iron levels tested to make sure they aren't high.

20:34:37
Kristina
We can work with him on all these issues at the Optimal Health Center, if he needs the support.

20:35:29
Sharon M
I will pass this all to him and hope to make plans with you.

20:35:37
Kristina
Perfect, Razoriowa!

20:35:43
Kristina
How often do you take enemas?

20:35:49
Kristina
Have you found they help you?

20:36:11
Kristina
Are you concerned that they are upsetting your bowel flora balance?

20:36:19
razoriowa
I average once a week, right now sometimes twice.

20:36:28
Kristina
Are you having a symptoms of ill health from taking enemas?

20:36:46
Sharon M
We use to do it twice a week. Yes, they do help.

20:37:23
razoriowa
No, they do not seem to bother in general. I feel they help me overall and have cleared some intestinal groin area pains I had.

20:37:34
Kristina
Implanting probiotics, like Natren's Bifidonate, does help to improve healthy levels of gut flora in the colon. Don't use other types of probiotics, like acidophilus because that isn't a resident of the colon.

20:38:18
Dave
Taking constipating drugs, i also find I need a bag about weekly.

20:38:27
razoriowa
Would the implant help with intestinal gas?

20:39:02
razoriowa
I find as my age goes up, so does my buildup of gas.

20:39:06
Kristina
For some a probiotic implant will help with intestinal gas. Try it for a month. 

20:39:25
Kristina
Yes, you need to improve on your digestive abilities.

20:39:40
Kristina
Poor digestion doesn't have to be a symptom of aging.

20:40:14
Jim P.
I have controlled IBS by taking daily enemas for the past 50 years and have had no side effects.  

20:40:15
Kristina
Have you tried my Ten Day Diet to see how that affects your gas?

20:40:39
Kristina
Thanks for letting us know, Jim. Can you tell us the story of how you came to that solution?

20:40:44
razoriowa
I did one time but it did not seem to change things.

20:41:18
razoriowa
My work and travel these days may be more the reason for digestive changes.

20:41:49
Sharon M
Kristina, could you explain more about the wrong probiotics being used?

20:42:37
Jim P.
When I was in college the doctors were trying many differents treatments.  Then a doctor told me to try enemas.  I was able to stop all drug treatments and as I said have been able to keep IBS under control.     

20:42:45
Kristina
For those of you who haven't read our blog yet, please do have a look. There are many interesting topics that we blog about such as quitting smoking, detoxification, colon implants, healthy cookware, fibromyalgia and emotional stress, and more.

20:43:10
Kristina
Also, I am working on my next book through regular blog posts, so I also have a personal blog going.

20:44:10
Kristina
What symptoms were you having in college? Gut pain? Diarrhea?

20:45:49
Jim P.
The symptoms were constipation, bloating, gas, unable to eat at times, abdominal pain, and cramping. 

20:46:38
Kristina
At the time was it difficult to take regular enemas?

20:46:56
Kristina
How often did you take enemas?

20:47:10
Kristina
What solution did you use in the enema?

20:47:18
Kristina
Where did you get your enema bag?

20:47:34
Kristina
As you can tell, I am a writer who loves a great story!

20:49:12
Jim P.
No! I have never had a problem taking enemas and always found them very soothing.  I use sea salt.  I used to get my enema bags at the drug store but now get them from OHN.

20:51:38
Jim P.
My primary care physician now agrees with the daily enema routine because it controls the IBS.  Since there is no proven cure for IBS, she says whatever works we use. 

20:52:40
Sharon M
Jim, if you take enema daily, do you still have regular bowel movements?

20:52:45
Kristina
Have you ever not taken the enemas in all these years and had a recurrence of the IBS?

20:54:50
Jim P.
Even when I have normal bowel movements, I still rinse out with an enema.  I have tried to stop taking enemas but always within a day begin to experience discomfort, even with normal bowel movements.

20:54:56
Kristina
Our next live chat is at noon, central time, Wednesday, February 23rd.

20:56:03
Kristina
I am doing a radio show on Tuesday, March 8th at 7pm. 

20:56:14
Kristina
The show is all about detoxification.

20:56:25
Sharon M
Thanks for the info, Kristina. Have a blessed evening. Bye.

20:56:26
Kristina
It will last until 8:30.

20:56:27
Dave
Jim, is it a full bag or just a small one?

20:56:30
Kristina
This is all central time.

20:56:55
Jim P.
Always two quarts.

20:56:57
Kristina
If you live in New York, the show starts at 8; California, the show starts at 5.

20:57:17
Dave
How do we tune in?

20:57:40
Kristina
You can access the radio show by going to www.blogtalkradio.com/FHWellness

20:58:19
Dave
Thanks. Enemas come up I guess?

20:58:26
Kristina
Thank you all for attending tonight's live chat.
