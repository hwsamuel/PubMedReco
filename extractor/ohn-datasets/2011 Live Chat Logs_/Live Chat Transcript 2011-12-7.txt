Welcome everyone!

Hi cwenger.

13:01:12
deedee
Hello Joseph.

13:01:18
Joseph
Hello Deedee.

13:01:28
Joseph
How are you?

13:01:37
cwenger
Hi DeeDee

13:02:02
Joseph
Hello cwenger.

13:02:18
cwenger
Hello Joseph.

13:02:34
deedee
Does anyone have any questions to start?

13:03:17
Joseph
Just want to thank you for the essential oils you sent me and for how nicely they were packaged, DeeDee.

13:04:07
cwenger
Same here. I have really had good luck with the prostate essential oil blend.

13:04:09
deedee
One of my clients wanted me to post a question - he is unable to attend.  His question was  if anyone in the group has a post-workout regime for enemas to rehydrate the body after the workout.

13:04:35
deedee
You're welcome, Joseph. Have you been able to try them out yet?

13:05:16
Joseph
Yes, DeeDee. I mixed them exactly as you told me and the oil made quite a few suppositories.

13:05:49
deedee
Cwenger, I am so glad.  I would love to use your testimonial on the website or newsletter anonymously.

13:06:21
deedee
Joseph, remind me what you are using the suppositories for?

13:06:21
Joseph
In actuality, I sometimes use enemas before a workout to motivate me because it gives me energy.

13:06:33
cwenger
OK, I could write up a more complete testimonial.

13:07:15
Joseph
I had a list, but mainly for restoring flora after the antibiotics I was on.

13:07:27
deedee
That is a good idea to do the enemas before the workout!  It also can keep you hydrated before.

13:07:40
deedee
Thanks, cwenger.

13:07:52
Joseph
I really need a mix for inflammation and pain.

13:08:21
deedee
Joseph, I can definitely make a mixture for that.  Is the pain in a certain area, or what is the source?

13:08:30
cwenger
Do you make up suppositories to be used to relieve constipation?

13:09:37
deedee
Yes, the suppositories can be used for constipation.  Many times when used at night, people find that it creates a BM the next morning.  I would make a specific blend for that.

13:10:10
cwenger
Would that be an essential oil blend?

13:10:16
deedee
Yes, you could rub the suppoitory around the outer hemorrhoid first and then insert it.

13:10:18
Joseph
Sore legs, low back pain, and hip pain and inflammation in my hands, just from sports and working out and not stretching as I should.

13:10:32
deedee
Yes, I would blend the oils for that.

13:10:43
Joseph
Awesome.

13:10:47
deedee
Is it arthritis?

13:11:16
Joseph
Maybe some in my hands, but just general soreness, aging lol.

13:12:19
deedee
There are several oils that decrease inflammation, and therefore decrease pain also.  You could also use some oils topically on the spots for a more instant relief also.

13:13:24
deedee
I am going to be writing more about this in the next newsletter also, but essential oils can cross the blood-brain barrier, therefore they can work much more effectively because they can get into the brain and central nervous system more readily than many things, even perscription drugs.

13:14:13
Joseph
See, that makes sense, plus the blend you made for me helped with my allergies and smells wonderful!

13:14:39
deedee
That is one of the many reasons that the oils work so effectively and many times much quicker than drugs.

13:15:02
deedee
Two added benefits! Great!

13:15:44
deedee
Have you both remained healthy so far in this cold and flu season?

13:16:23
Joseph
I get a flu shot, DeeDee.

13:16:33
cwenger
I have. It has been a really long time since I have had the flu. I never take flu shots.

13:16:36
deedee
If we can do things like herbs, oils, enemas, etc., to prevent these things, we will be so much farther ahead than those who wait to treat just the symptoms once they get sick.

13:17:42
deedee
I know some people feel that the flu shot really helps them and others never take them.  It is such a personal choice and everyone has their own reasons for doing or not doing it. It is good to get both perspectives, though.

13:18:36
deedee
We have a sunny, crisp, cold day here today.   How is it by you two?

13:18:59
Joseph
I would love to defend against it naturally, but it is a habit since I've had asthma all my life.

13:19:13
cwenger
It is a miserable rainy day as it was yesterday.

13:19:16
Joseph
But I've been doing well this season, thank goodness.

13:19:18
deedee
Joseph, do you get pain and stiffness at night in bed also?

13:19:32
Joseph
Cloudy and cold here  in Chicago.

13:20:03
Joseph
Most definitely, DeeDee. More so upon waking, though.

13:20:20
deedee
Yes, asthma does make it a little more complicated.  Have you been able to decrease your asthma symptoms with enemas and natural approaches to your health?

13:21:50
deedee
Joseph, you know what really works well for me, especially in the colder months?  I make this wonderful heating bag that I heat in the microwave and then take to bed with me or use when I am watching TV, etc.

13:22:27
Joseph
Oh yes, I've reduced symptoms mostly with trying to stay active. I use enemas when I feel a cold coming on.

13:22:39
deedee
I put some essential oils on the sore spots, put the heating bag on, and it takes the pain  away so well. It is amazing!  I use this on my stomach for stomach aches as well.  I could make you one up if you'd like.

13:22:47
Joseph
That's a great idea. DeeDee. Thank you. I will do that tonight when I get home from work.

13:23:31
Joseph
I have a water bottle and one of those rice neck bags.

13:24:12
deedee
The bag is made from soft material and has rice and essential oils/herbs in it.  It heats well and holds its heat.  It can also be put into the freezer for when you need a cold pack.

13:24:28
deedee
Yes, that is great!

13:26:46
deedee
Do either of you have any questions you'd like to ask today?

13:27:30
cwenger
I can't think of anything else.

13:27:56
deedee
I do plan on holding a second live chat session this month on Wed., Dec. 28, at 12:00 central time, since we missed the one last week due to password issues.  I apologize for that if either of you tried to get on.

13:28:26
deedee
Is there a topic that either of you would like to see discussed in the future?

13:29:01
Joseph
Nothing else from me. I will contact you about the essential oils, DeeDee.

13:29:05
cwenger
OK, great. I'll be in Florida then, but I'll check in then.

13:29:42
deedee
That sounds great!  Talk to you both soon and let me know if there are any topics you'd like us to look into as a group.

13:30:02
Joseph
You bet, DeeDee. Have great day, both of you.

13:30:15
deedee
Thank you. You also!

13:30:46
cwenger
Thanks, DeeDee. Have a nice day.

13:31:10
deedee
Thank you, cwenger. You took a trip recently, didn't you?  How did that go?

13:32:03
cwenger
It was great. We ended up in Florida, and then back to Maryland last month.

13:32:38
deedee
What was your favorite part?  Did you do cleansing while on the trip?

13:32:58
cwenger
We hope to attend the air show in Oshkosh next summer. Hope I can see you again then.

13:33:33
deedee
That would be great!  I know a few clients that go there and they stop by here either on the way up or the way down.

13:33:36
cwenger
Yes, I had 2 additional colonics after the one you gave me.

13:33:48
deedee
Great!

13:34:46
cwenger
I found a new colon therapist in Florida who will give me a coffee enema after a colonic.

13:35:11
deedee
That is great, does she know of us up here?

13:35:43
cwenger
I did tell her about you.

13:36:59
deedee
Well, I am glad that she knows the benefits and is willing to provide them.

13:37:24
cwenger
When I get back to Florida, I am thinking of having a colonic and coffee enema about every week or two. Do you think every week would be too often?

13:38:50
deedee
No, that time frame is fine.  Do you know how long you will do that?

13:39:13
cwenger
Probably for several months.

13:41:37
deedee
Sounds great!  Keep me posted on how you feel and how it is going.  Maybe you can share some of the details with the group also.

13:42:08
cwenger
OK, thanks for the chat. Guess I'll sign off for now.
