Hi Howard!

13:02:01
deedee
Howard, do you have any questions or concerns today?

13:03:58
deedee
Welcome Diane and Randy.

13:04:05
randyu
Hi.

13:05:10
deedee
Anything new, Randy, or any questions?

13:05:13
howard
Hello, DeeDee. Thank you for giving help with arthritis behind my knees. Section 140 of Kristina's book was very helpful.

13:06:15
deedee
I am glad, Howard. What have you all tried?  and what works best?

13:06:55
randyu
Still have IBS.  No cure?

13:08:21
deedee
Randy, I attended a very informative workshop this past weekend which I will begin incorporating into the practice here.

13:08:34
deedee
The ancient Chinese practice, practiced by monks, is called Chi Nei Tsang and it is very promising for those with IBS, colitis, constipation, Crohn's, etc.

13:08:46
randyu
Explain it.

13:09:43
deedee
It is a hands-on holistic healing practice of ancient Chinese Taoist tradition. Chi Nei Tsang involves the application of Chi-Kung in the manual treatment of the viscera (Nei-Tsang) and the deepest internal structures of the body.

13:10:38
deedee
I will explore the abdomen, mapping the tensions that are in the tissues. The work is mostly gentle, and the touch is soft, although it can be deep.

13:11:12
howard
Especially with the nurse since I was on Cumadin to continue taking herbal vitamin and Omega3 and more importly the herbal tea and sesame oil and to recheck to INR on a weekly schedule (at least for now).

13:11:14
deedee
Places that are tender are explored and through awareness, focused breathing, and gentle maniplation, the holdings in the tissues are relaxed and released.

13:11:46
deedee
Welcome Renae and Stu.

13:12:25
deedee
That is great, Howard.  Keep us posted on your progress!

13:12:35
deedee
Welcome, Dave.

13:12:37

Hi all.

13:12:55
stu k
Greetings.

13:13:10
renae j
Hello.

13:13:19
deedee
Randy, this practice is especially helpful for those with IBS.

13:13:20
stu k
Hi.

13:13:25
howard
Can I take sesame oil with my coffee enema since it works very well with the herbal tea?

13:13:42
randyu
DeeDee, where can I get more info in my area?

13:13:43
deedee
Sure, Howard, that would be fine to do.

13:14:16
howard
Thanks, DeeDee. You're a doll.

13:14:42
deedee
Randy, unfortunately it is not widely practiced yet in the US, but if you do a search on Chi Nei Tsang, you may find a person who practices that technique.

13:15:04
randyu
Thanks.

13:15:29
renae j
I have a foul odor coming from my body and colon with systemic yeast.  Which of the essential oils should I use with my enema?

13:15:49
stu k
Hi, DeeDee. What is your opinion on Epsom salt enemas?

13:16:08
deedee
I am very excited to combine this technique with the essential oils and herbal therapy I am working with.  I also plan to add a session prior to colonic or enema that includes this technique using essential oil, and then a castor pack with a heating bag.

13:17:01
Charla D.
Hi.

13:17:37
deedee
Epsom salts are very purging.     Do not use magnesium sulfate (Epsom Salt) as a laxative if you have stomach (abdominal) pain, nausea, or vomiting.

13:18:27
stu k
So you should not us Epsom salts at all?

13:18:50
deedee
I do prefer Celtic sea salt to Epsom salts, but if you are going to try it, use 1 tablespoon in 2 quarts warm water and mix well.

13:19:04
deedee
Welcome, Charla.

13:19:06
stu k
Thank you.

13:19:08
Charla D.
Thanks.

13:20:07
deedee
Renae, lemongrass is a perfect essential oil to use with yeast. You could also try thyme and tea tree

13:20:18
deedee
and geranium.

13:20:44
renae j
Thank you.

13:21:01
deedee
Hi Larry!

13:21:33
deedee
Have any of you tried essential oil suppositories or implants with oil?

13:21:40
Charla D.
No.

13:21:46
stu k
No.

13:21:56
Larry
Good afternoon, everyone.

13:22:26
deedee
Essential oils can work wonders in the body, and the colon is a perfect absorption spot for them.

13:22:31
Charla D.
What are the pluses of using them?

13:24:04
renae j
What other things should I include in the enema?

13:24:06
deedee
Essential oils are very healing and the type we use are very pure.  The colon absorbs the healing oils into the system and they work on whatever health problem you are having.  They also work well on the skin, orally, and as aromatherapy.

13:24:40
renae j
May have parasites.

13:24:49
DaveC
I've not had a chance to try.

13:24:59
Larry
Which probiotic do I order for use in the enema solution?

13:25:27
deedee
Renae, first I would do a cleansing enema using lavender castile soap, then you can do a second cleansing enema with Celtic sea salt and essential oil mix.  You may find a coffee implant with some of the oils at the end of the 2 cleanses works well for you.

13:26:18
stu k
How much sea salt should you put in the enema?

13:27:05
deedee
For parasites, lemongrass, tarragon, anise, Idaho tansy, basil, peppermint, ginger, nutmeg, tea tree and rosemary, to name a few.

13:28:09
deedee
Larry, the one we use is Natren Bifidonate because it contains strains found in the large intestine.  It comes in powdered form, so easy to use in water, or mix with coconut oil as a suppository - which several people find very easy to use.

13:28:33
deedee
Stu - you would use 1 teaspoon of sea salt per quart of warm water.

13:28:35
Larry
Thanks.

13:28:39
renae j
Thanks so much, DeeDee.

13:28:48
deedee
You're welcome!

13:28:50
stu k
Thank you.

13:29:26
Charla D.
So do you make or buy coconut oil suppositories?

13:29:44
deedee
Howard, why don't you tell the group about your experience with the flu and what happened.

13:29:44
Larry
FYI on the salt... I had to cut back 50% as I was starting to get headaches with the standard amount.  Don't know why, but it worked.

13:29:47
Charla D.
I have been buying coconut milk and drinking it.

13:30:15
deedee
A client of mine said his wife got the flu and she got the flu shot.  He did not get the shot and did not get the flu!

13:30:36
Charla D.
So you don't recommend flu shots then?

13:31:01
deedee
Charla, coconut milk is excellent.  So is the water and the oil.  You can't go wrong with it.

13:31:03
Charla D.
I didn't get one last year because of a clinic I went to last year.

13:32:06
deedee
We do not get the flu shot here, but do not necessarily want to make recommendations to others. We just want you to have all the info and be able to make a knowledgeable decision for yourself.

13:32:20
Charla D.
I know I need more water to drink, but what happens or what should you add to it to get past this time?

13:32:23
Larry
I got the flu shot but it does take a period of time after the shot to fully develop protection.  Even though I believe in the shot, I have a friend with a very bad experience from the shot.

13:33:12
Charla D.
Always seems when my system is slightly toxic that water doesn't taste that great or I have to force myself to stay with it and not drink other things.

13:33:49
Charla D.
Lately I have been feeling really sluggish and tired.

13:33:58
DaveC
Have had the shot on and off in recent years and made no difference.

13:33:59
Larry
He's in his 80's and was paralyzed in all 4 limbs for several days.  He now has a long road of PT to recover.  Now he's developed a massive dose of shingles.

13:34:17
randyu
Thanks, DeeDee. Have a good day!!

13:34:36
deedee
Charla, what I find helps me to drink more water during the day is to make it taste better using healthy additives such as grapefruit, lemon, orange, tangerine, or citrus fresh essential oil.  You could also add a little Stevia to it to make it taste sweeter.

13:34:44
randyu
Signing off now.

13:34:44
deedee
Thanks, Randy.

13:34:53
deedee
Welcome Maryam.

13:35:02
Charla D.
Yes, I have done the stevia to it at times.

13:35:21
Charla D.
That sounds good with the essential oils added.

13:35:27
Maryam
Hi, DeeDee.

13:35:33
stu k
Hi Charla. I would recommend the Brita Water Filter. It does improve the taste of tap water.

13:35:39
deedee
Adding in one of the citrus oils makes it taste great and gives you nutrients too.

13:35:43
Charla D.
Really thanks, Stu.

13:35:52
Charla D.
I have one I need to use.

13:36:06
Charla D.
Is that citrus essential oil?

13:36:08
deedee
Yes, definitely use filtered or spring water - no tap water.

13:36:40
deedee
Yes, we use Young Living because it is internal grade oil.

13:36:47
Charla D.
OK, thanks. I have lots of acid reflux at times... and have to take a pill for it. Any ideas for calming it?

13:38:00
stu k
I have the same problem.

13:38:05
deedee
Yes, if you do happen to get the flu or a cold, doing a week of enemas really makes you feel better a lot quicker and takes the intensity and duration down.

13:38:05
Maryam
Is there a specific topic being covered today?

13:38:21
Charla D.
My allergy doctor says to take the pills and it calms my asthma when I have it.

13:39:24
deedee
Charla, yes, definitely!  Pills for acid reflux actually inhibit digestion and create more digestive issues down the road.

13:39:46
deedee
It is better to talk one-on-one about everything so I can make a better recommendation, but I would probably get you on enzymes, probiotics, and herbs to prevent acid reflux and to heal the digestive tract.

13:40:03
Charla D.
Yes, I need to get on enzymes for sure.

13:40:13
Charla D.
I used to be on them.

13:40:17
deedee
Maryam, you can bring up any topic you'd like - we cover everything!

13:40:25
howard
I have to sign off now. Thank you, DeeDee.

13:40:47
deedee
Thank you, Howard.  Talk to you next time.

13:40:54
Charla D.
Are essential amino acids good to take?

13:41:19
deedee
They can be; it depends on the person's situation.

13:41:35
Charla D.
Well, I do muscle testing with the two gals off and on

13:41:56
deedee
Yes, muscle testing can help.

13:42:08
Charla D.
and she recommended I take some... and also I am taking lymphatic cleanse pills again.

13:42:50
deedee
OK, great.

13:43:02
DaveC
In olden days,  as DeeDee says, one or more enemas were expected at flu or cold times, especially if accompanied by constipation.

13:43:28
Charla D.
I took a series of IVs last year at this time... h2o peroxide ones... Helps me lots.

13:43:32
deedee
Yes, Dave, you know that!

13:43:47
Charla D.
Yes, my grandmother taught me that at an early age.

13:44:00
deedee
Charla, what do you take them for?  What does it help specifically?

13:44:03
Charla D.
She took them her whole life off and on.and lived to be in her 80s.

13:44:05
DaveC
Can vouch for it!

13:44:20
Charla D.
Gets rid of yeast and chelates the body.

13:44:42
deedee
That is great.  I do not know of many places that offer that.

13:44:45
Charla D.
and helps allergies... breathing, etc. Gets rid of lots for sure.

13:44:56
deedee
Maryam, do you have a question or topic?

13:44:58
Charla D.
There is a place in Edmond, OK

13:45:03
Charla D.
I live in OKC, and there was a place in Jenks, OK, before I moved here.

13:45:25
Charla D.
When our body craves the wrong food... what does that tell us?

13:46:25
Larry
Catch you next session, DeeDee... The fish are calling my name right now!

13:46:26
Charla D.
It is comfort food that make us feel better but not really.

13:46:36
Charla D.
Bye Larry.

13:46:50
Charla D.
Hi Michal.

13:46:59
Maryam
I have a kidney cyst and would like to know if enemas are OK for its treatment?

13:47:17
deedee
Craving the wrong food says many different things.  I would encourage a hair tissue mineral analysis so we can evaluate mineral ratios, digestion and absorption, blood sugar issues, thyroid, and adrenal issues.  Usually it is one or a combo of these things.

13:47:34
deedee
Welcome, Michal.

13:48:16
Charla D.
Do you send your hair specimens in to your clinic then?

13:48:44
deedee
Does the cyst affect your elimination of urine right now?  What kind of cyst is it?

13:49:46
deedee
You send the hair sample here per instructions on the kit and we then send it to our lab that we work with  - Analytical Research Labs.

13:50:16
Maryam
No not at all! Not sure of the type.

13:50:30
Charla D.
Thanks.

13:51:23
deedee
Yes, then I would say enema therapy could be very beneficial to you.  The kidneys, or at least one of them, need to be in good working order because of the fluids that may be absorbed and eliminated during the process.

13:52:24
deedee
Maryam, some essentail oils that could be beneficial to the kidney are juniper, geranium, grapefruit, and lemon.

13:53:29
deedee
Michal - did you have anything to ask or add?

13:54:18
michal
Maybe she needs a CAT scan of kidneys or an MRI.

13:55:13
michal
To be sure that it is a cyst and not an abscess or a tumor, like RENOMA.

13:55:31
deedee
Have you had that, Maryam?

13:55:59
michal
Do you have  polycystic kidney disease?

13:56:11
Maryam
I have your Ten Days to Optimal Health book (which is very informative) and would like to start right away. Would that be OK?

13:56:38
Maryam
Thank you, Michael.

13:56:51
deedee
Welcome, Cristi.

13:57:24
Charla D.
Hi Cristina.

13:57:29
cristinag
Hello.

13:57:39
Charla D.
I have the book too and need to really follow it again.

13:57:50
michal
You are  welcome, Maryam.

13:57:52
Charla D.
I get all my supples from your group.

13:58:16
cristinag
I just started taking an iron supplement and they cause serious constipation. Suggestions?

13:58:28
Charla D.
What do you do when your whole body feels really dry and you drink and it still seems to feel that way?

13:58:52
deedee
Yes, the eating plan and the cleansing part would be fine.  I think I'd like to evaluate before the fasting part, though. 

13:59:07
Charla D.
I have not ever done the fasting part

13:59:55
Maryam
Evaluate meaning consultation?

13:59:59
deedee
Iron supplements do tend to do that, but if you can use a whole food supplement, that seems to help.  Also, you may want to try some reacted magnesium to keep stool soft.

14:00:32
Charla D.
I use the calm formula.

14:00:35
deedee
Maryam, yes, it could be brief, but I would feel more comfortable with that.

14:00:46
Charla D.
What is your reacted magnesium? Is it better?

14:00:46
michal
Long, long ago, in a country far, far away they were giving lots of enemas for many ailments and diseases. In hospitals, in clinics, at homes.

14:01:04
Maryam
OK.

14:01:09
Charla D.
I think that is great Michal.

14:01:15
michal
I remember it wery well. Patients actually were expecting it.

14:01:22
Charla D.
Gets the poisons and toxics out.

14:01:28
cristinag
Thank you. :)

14:01:36
michal
And I feel it is often very beneficial.

14:01:52
Charla D.
I get at times a spastic colon and enemas help me to get past it.

14:02:16
Maryam
Thank you all very much.

14:02:48
deedee
The reacted magnesium that we carry is in pill form, so easier to dose,  magnesium citrate.

14:03:16
deedee
Chamomile is also great for spastic colon.

14:03:21
Charla D.
Sometimes it just stops and also when my back needs to be put back in the right positions.

14:03:38
Charla D.
Well, when I take anything or smell with chamomile, it activates my allergies.

14:03:53
deedee
Well my client is here, so I have to say goodbye to you all and thank you all for sharing and being here.  See you all next time.

14:04:02
Charla D.
I can never wear perfume and have to use everything smell-free.

14:04:12
Charla D.
Thanks... was good... my first time for one of these.

14:04:22
deedee
Thanks Charla!

14:04:24
Charla D.
Can we e-mail you with questons?

14:04:27
stu k
Thank you very much, DeeDee.

14:04:33
Charla D.
Thanks.

14:04:37
deedee
Yes.

14:04:40
Charla D.
Thanks.

14:04:43
Charla D.
Bye for now.

14:04:44
deedee
Thanks, Stu.

14:05:08
Maryam
Bye.

14:05:09
deedee
Thanks, Michal, Renae, Maryam, Cristina.

14:05:13
stu k
Good-bye, Charla. Hope you feel better.

14:05:28
stu k
Bye guys...

14:06:53

Good-bye everybody.
