Welcome everyone!  You beat me on, Larry! 

13:00:11
Larry
It took me a bit to get off the couch.  I got another injection this am and will go another 24 to see if I'll be admitted.

13:01:44
deedee
Welcome Shamus.

13:01:59
deedee
Larry, what kind of spider bit you? Do you know?

13:02:07
deedee
Welcome John.

13:02:18
John C
Hi DeeDee!

13:02:34
Larry
I'm not sure... but I hope I killed it.

13:02:57
deedee
Wow!  Have you had that kind of reaction to spider bites before?

13:03:02
John C
I'm a first time visitor to the chat line, but a long time follower of OHN.

13:03:25
Larry
Never had a reation to anything.

13:03:26
deedee
Do you have anything to ask or share, John?

13:03:46
John C
Yes, couple of questions:

13:03:50
deedee
Larry, now you will have to get the gut reconditioned after the probiotics.

13:04:16
Larry
Yes, and I could use your advice on that.

13:04:26
deedee
Antibiotics, I meant.

13:05:09
deedee
Well, we have a good probiotic called OrthoBiotic which has 20 billion CFUs so it is pretty potent.

13:05:41
John C
Several years ago I followed a cleansing regimen that consisted of fasting and daily high enemas, but I can't seem to find the file that had the details. Are you familiar withsuch a regimen?

13:05:52
Larry
I'm getting another order ready and I'll go with your recommendations.

13:06:09
deedee
Some topics of interest lately are how to know if you have a thyroid issue and what to do once you find out.  Do any of you suspect thyroid issues?  I know you have some, Larry.

13:06:34
deedee
Larry, let me know your order after the session and I will put it in for you.

13:07:07
Larry
Thanks.

13:07:28
deedee
John, we do have our own regime of fasting and high enemas. It may be similar.  How long did you fast, do you remember?

13:07:38
deedee
Welcome Howard.

13:08:28
deedee
One of our fasting protocols is a 5- or 7-day fast during which time you do daily enemas of 2 cleansing and 1 coffee right in a row.  Does that sound similar?

13:08:51
John C
I seem to recall it wasn't a complete fast - involved taking supplements such as psyllium husks, and others. Last time I did it must have been over 5 years ago. Yes, that sounds familiar!

13:09:26
Larry
Even though it's very tough to move around, I'm wondering about increasing the coffee enemas to at least 1x/day to help with all this toxin removal.

13:09:55
deedee
Thyroid issues most often stem from adrenal issues.  When the adrenals are fatigued and working harder then they should, the thyroid steps in to save them from exhaustion.  Sometimes these things are not picked up on blood tests until they are so severe.

13:10:29
deedee
We do hair testing which indicates a problem at the cellular level so that we catch it much quicker and can treat faster.

13:11:06
Larry
TG my PCP is also in agreement with you.

13:11:11
John C
It was very effective! Was surprised that lots of bad stuff was coming out of my colon 5 days after I stopped eating!

13:11:59
deedee
John, our Vit-Ra-Tox system includes supplements and a psyllium powder and bentonite clay drink that you mix.  You can have nutritious liquids such as veggie juices, broths, teas, etc., while on it also.

13:12:35
John C
Is this protocol on the website?

13:12:46
Howard
I was wondering if you had a thing for arthritis.

13:12:59
deedee
Larry, if you are physically able, try and do 2 cleansing enemas and the coffee like we do here, every day to help your body get rid of the toxins of the poisons and medications.

13:13:28
Larry
Having recently done the Vit-Ra-Tox program, I'd like to suggest raw milk be included and make extreme efforts to locate a source near you.

13:13:40
shamus
I'd like to know more about the proper use of essential oils in an enema series. Does it help  promote a more complete bowel movement?

13:14:15
deedee
We probably do mention the fasting and enemas throughout the website, but I am not sure if there is a specific article on it.  We have so many, I forgot.

13:14:53
deedee
Look up Vit-Ra-Tox on the website to see the products, etc.,  and go to the archived newsletters - April issue.  This talks about the enema protocol.

13:15:08
deedee
I can help you through that also.

13:16:39
deedee
Shamus, some essential oils are stimulating while others are relaxing.  I use peppermint a lot in the second enema with sea salt (see our April newsletter) for details.  Oils can make a difference in cleansing for sure.  I use purification blend, lemongrass,

13:17:14
John C
OK, I'll go back to the website and search after I'm done here.

13:18:00
deedee
which is good for yeast and parasites and restoring healthy bowel flora; juvaflex for liver support; and so on.  Oils are also very useful in implants and suppositories because they are meant to stay in the colon longer, which gives them time to absorb.  

13:18:18
deedee
Absorption occurs quickly and effectively in the colon.

13:18:42
Larry
Could you touch on the use of salt and Epsom salt in the enema solution?

13:19:34
deedee
Larry, great idea about the raw milk if you tolerate dairy well.  Also, coconut oils are excellent to give energy during the fast and are also good for the thyroid, to tie the two subjects together.  It is also antimicrobial!

13:19:53
deedee
Welcome Dave.

13:20:24
Dave
Hi all.

13:21:39
deedee
The use of sea salt in the water can help the cleansing process.  I use 1 tsp. of sea salt per quart of water.  Sea salt can balance electrolytes in the system.  Too much plain water use in enemas is not good because it alters our balance.

13:22:24
John C
Second questions: At what age should a parent introduce their children to the periodic use of enemas for colon health? My mother started with me at age 8. It was done in a slow and careful way so I wouldn't dread the procedure.

13:22:49
deedee
Epsom salts have to be used more cautiously.  It is very purging in nature and too much can be harmful.  One tablespoon in 2 quarts is all you want to use.

13:22:55
Dave
Has salt-soda replaced soap as best enema ingredient?

13:23:52
PH
Is there a negative to purified water?  Is shower filter water better?

13:24:30
deedee
John, if the child has some colon issues, you can start them as an infant to help them establish good bowel health.  If they have no issues, I would not necessarily introduce them.  I would also be careful around puberty time.  This seems to create lasting

13:26:10
deedee
impressions, some that may be negative.  Anywhere between infant and 10 yrs. old would be fine, again if the child needs help.  I do not think I would do it on a regular basis otherwise.

13:26:25
deedee
Done in a very gentle and understanding way, and never making the child feel as if it were a punishment or discipline.

13:27:23
Dave
I think enemas have largely been an as-needed therapy, esprecially for kids.

13:27:53
deedee
PH, purified water is great and filtered is fine too.  Anything that brings the water closest to its natural state.  I think spring water fits into that category because it has its minerals, but not the toxic elements and additives, etc.

13:28:23
deedee
Welcome Randy.

13:29:27
Howard
Thank you DeeDee. I found the article New Colon Therapy from Sarah.

13:30:11
deedee
It seems that enema ingredients are continually evolving, especially here because we are looking into different additives for different purposes.  That is why the essential oils and herbs have really interested me.

13:31:20
Dave
Back in the old days, Ivory seems to have cornered the market for ingredients.

13:32:13
randyu
Plain water at room temp or slightly chilled is the best.

13:32:15
deedee
Hi Howard. I missed your question about arthritis.  Far infrared saunas are absolutely wonderful for that.  There are also herbs and oils to be taken orally or through enema implants that would be good too.

13:34:24
Larry
I viewed the video you were shooting on my last visit... runner and his dog.  You left out the comments he made about the benefits to his dog.  Very amazing!

13:35:22
deedee
Plain water can be fine for one enema, but it is hypotonic which means there is lower pressure than intracellular fluid.

13:36:29
deedee
This can throw off electrolyte balance if used often.

13:37:34
deedee
Larry, we kept the dog info off at this time because the subject was very raw to him at the time.  He was told his dog only had two months to live - that was five months ago, yeah!!  He will probably talk about that more later on.

13:37:35
randyu
Thanks DeeDee, for that info about plain water.

13:38:19
Dave
How about consumption of water orally, in these high-temp days, along with cool enemas

13:39:01
Dave
for hydration?

13:39:23
deedee
So now we are treating dogs too! He brings the dog in to do FIR saunas, and he is also on several supplements.  He has a brain tumor and it was causing him not to be able to walk, etc.  The dog is 14 yrs. old, and they said his only option for keeping 

13:39:56
deedee
the dog alive longer was radiatio. He decided against that.  Now the dog is walking around much better and is much more alert.  Who knows what may happen!

13:41:45
deedee
Dave, yes definitely drink plenty of water and spread it out throughout the day.  Drink half of your body weight in water in ounces  (100 lb. person drink 50 oz. daily).  IF you excerise or are outside for periods of time, or drink dehydrating liquids such as 

13:41:58
deedee
coffee, add another couple of 8-oz. glasses.

13:42:04
Larry
Can you recommend an esential oil for my battle with the spider bite/antibiotics? I think I did enough to stay hydrated outside, but thanks for the weight-water formula.

13:43:35
deedee
For the bite, purification oil, thieves oil, tea tree, lavender.

13:44:51
deedee
For the antibiotics, Di-Gize, lemongrass.

13:45:20
Larry
Thanks... I have already made up about a half dozen lavender suppositories.

13:45:38
deedee
That is great.  Put some directly on the bite also.

13:46:24
Larry
I tried the Super Salve but it was just too painful to rub it in.

13:46:58
deedee
If some of you haven't seen our new videos yet, or our article on REAL adrenal/immunity herbal tonic, please check it out.  I have a new video coming out explaining how to make these coconut oil/essential oil suppositories because I have a lot questions.

13:47:22
deedee
Good idea though.  Did it sting?

13:50:10
deedee
Another question came up about the use of colon tubes and our smoothflow syringe and hose system.  They both can work very well separately, but put them together, and it makes a high, thorough enema much more possible and comfortable.

13:51:20
deedee
The colon tube starts the water up higher so you avoid that need to purge right away (passes the part with more nerve endings) and the pump then delivers the water so efficiently.

13:51:40
deedee
It works like a charm and many clients tell me they can hardly feel the pressure and cannot believe how much water they were able to take in so comfortably.

13:52:50
deedee
How many of you have watched any of the videos, and do you have comments or questions about them?  They were very unrehearsed and kind of raw, but hopefully got the information out.

13:52:53
Dave
My enemas from the  very start never seemed to exceed 2 quarts. 

13:53:46
Larry
DeeDee, thanks for covering so many topics and answering everything.  I'll e-mail you this afternoon w/ my new order.

13:54:46
Dave
With colonics, of course, I've done better.

13:57:17
shamus
DeeDee, thank you for a fine chat session.

13:58:51
Dave
Good chat. Bye.

13:59:14
deedee
Thank you all - see you next time.
