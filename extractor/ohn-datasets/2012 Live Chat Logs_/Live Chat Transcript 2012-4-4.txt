Hi DeeDee.

13:02:32
deedee
Welcome everyone! 

13:03:03
nicolasdk
Hi, I was wondering if you recommend getting an individual enema nozzle for each individual in a family or just share the same one?

13:03:32
deedee
Yes, definitely use different nozzle for each person.

13:03:54
Carl W
Hi DeeDee. Was there a chat last week?

13:05:07
DaveC
Hi DeeDee, all.

13:06:08
clintc
Hi DeeDee.

13:06:20
nicolasdk
I have a silicone tube with closed end.  Why is it recommended to get one for each individual?

13:06:24
clintc
I have a doctor's appointment in 14 minutes.

13:06:52
clintc
I just wanted to ask about the Gerson people recommending laying on your RIGHT side for a 1 qt enema.

13:06:53
deedee
There was supposed to be, but I think Kristina forgot to announce it.

13:07:11
clintc
What is your opinion on that?

13:07:36
clintc
They say it very clearly in several publications.

13:07:49
deedee
Because it would be difficult to sanitize the nozzle perfectly, we just recommend everyone having their own.

13:08:53
deedee
I am not sure what their reasoning is for lying on the right side, but coffee is absorbed to the liver on the upper left side, so you can move around a bit, but not necessarily lie on right side.

13:09:12
clintc
Thanks. I have to run. Bye.

13:09:24
deedee
Bye Clint.

13:09:34
DaveC
For that reason, I only want disposables for colonics.

13:10:42
deedee
Yes, I feel disposables work best for me.  I know some therapists do use stainless steel and then autoclave, but those are expensive and take a bit more time and effort.

13:10:57
deedee
Welcome Pam and Bonita.

13:11:22
Bonita W
Hello, I apologize for being late...

13:11:48
deedee
No problem, Bonita. You can come and go as you need to...

13:12:24
Bonita W
Thank you.

13:13:04
DaveC
Some years ago, I had an elderly (80s) therapist who favored  metal. She had an autoclave and no harm came to me, but regardless... 

13:13:38
deedee
Does anyone have any topics or questions for today?  I have been so busy, that I did not prepare a specific topic for today.

13:14:18
Carl W
I have been using essential oil (EO) suppositories for my prostate issues which have greatly improved. Do you think I should continue with the prostate blend EOs for maintainence, or should I stop?

13:14:47
DaveC
Offhand, do you have the plastic  disposable enema bags in stock?

13:15:16
deedee
Yes, we do have the 1.5 and the 2.5 vinyl in stock.

13:15:22
Pamela B
Hi DeeDee. I am so pleased to be a part of this community.  I do have a topic:  How to begin with an autistic person with suspect fecal compaction of the colon....MD procto first?

13:15:54
deedee
How do you all clean your equipment?  I do have many questions about that regularly.  Just curious what works for you all.

13:17:05
deedee
We recommend rinsing the system out with very warm soapy water to get rid of any oil residue, and then using a safe disinfectant such as grapefruit seed extract, or peroxide, vinegar, and my favorite - Thieves essential oil and cleaner (love the smell)!

13:17:27
DaveC
Hot water and 10% bleach solution seems best.

13:17:43
Bonita W
I use a few drops of GSE to clean my enema equipment but not sure if it's the best, however it's been working the few times I've done it.

13:18:05
Pamela B
I use hot soap/water followed by rinse, then immerse in H2O2 3% for 12-15 minutes or alternatively, the 10% bleach solution followed by clear water rinse.

13:18:21
Carl W
I use a plastic enema bucket which is easy to clean. I like it a lot better then the plastic bags.

13:18:26
deedee
For a person with a disablility, or anyone in that situation, I would start by giving something to loosen that up.  You could give Reacted Magnesium for a day or two, in higher doses to hydrate that stool.  That could loosen things up a bit.

13:18:28
Bonita W
Okay - great information... 

13:19:12
DaveC
Are we talking about rubber bags, enema cans, bulbs, or all?

13:19:29
Pamela B
How do I access the rest of your message...?

13:19:35
deedee
You can also do an oil implant. You loosen up and allow for easier evacuation.  This all of course will be dependent on the person's cooperation with different things.  I have worked with autistic children and adult disabled folks here before.

13:21:34
nicolasdk
I have the lemon essential oil from your site.  Is that good to use in an enema solution?

13:21:36
Pamela B
Do colon therapists do home visits in special circumstances?

13:21:58
nicolasdk
If so, how do you recommend it? 

13:22:13
deedee
You can clean all of your equipment like that.  I do recommend soaking the parts that actually go into the body though for a few hours.  Be careful with using oils in the latex though.

13:23:35
nicolasdk
In the instructional video after buying my enema equipment, I saw that the person getting the enema was on her right side but then after doing some research I found websites that say to lay on the left side. I am confused.  What is it that I should do?

13:23:40
deedee
Hi Dave. We generally do not recommend bleach because of its toxicity, and the bag does absorb some of that toxicity.

13:24:22
deedee
Lemon is a great oil to use in an enema  - I would use about 4 drops per quart or so.

13:24:23
nicolasdk
Oh, so the lemon essential oil is only to clean the enema equipment and not to use to clean the colon?

13:24:30
nicolasdk
Oh, OK. 

13:24:56
deedee
Nicolas, I think in the video it was just done that way for convenience's sake.

13:25:44
deedee
No, you can definitely use lemon essential oil (Young Living internal grade) for inside the colon - about 4 drops per quart of water.

13:26:13
DaveC
Thanks. I was thinking mostly about nozzles, which shouldn't be shared but were frequently when only one enema apparatus in most homes.

13:26:57
deedee
I understand now, Dave.  I am sure they used bleach a lot back then.

13:27:13
sreid
Hi DeeDee. I plan to perform my first coffee enema. What's the best time to do it?

13:27:19
nicolasdk
So the one you sell seems to be therapeutic grade, therefore I shouldn't use it for an enema?

13:27:23
DaveC
That or just hot, soapy water.

13:28:40
deedee
All of the oils we sell are therapeutic and internal grade - very safe to use internally.  I use them all the time in sessions here.  I cannot say how safe other brands are to use in the body though.

13:29:32
sreid
Also what's the best food intake practice before performing coffee enemas?

13:29:49
nicolasdk
Oh OK, great.  I have the Young Living lemon essential oil from your site so I will try that out.

13:29:52
deedee
Coffee enemas are probably best done in the A.M. due to the caffeine.

13:30:17
deedee
Make sure you do at least 1 cleansing enema before the coffee - 2 cleansing enemas is best before coffee.

13:31:15
deedee
Many people like to do their enemas on an empty stomach.  However you are comfortable.

13:31:44
DaveC
Are raw coffee beans an acceptable substitute for roasted?

13:32:04
sreid
Please tell me what a cleaning enema is and I had a colonic done last Wednesday - does that count?

13:33:30
sreid
They used what high oxygen water at my colonic session.

13:33:58
nicolasdk
After a coffee enema, should one do another enema later in the day to help eliminate bile waste that becomes excreted?

13:34:00
deedee
Welcome Debbi.

13:34:18
Pamela B
I have read that it is best to take a bit of fiber, i.e. soaked chia seeds, 20 minutes prior to coffee enema to protect the small intestine from toxic bile.  Is this a good practice?

13:34:20
Debbi
Thanks!  Had to install Java to get on... Sorry I'm late.

13:35:23
deedee
Raw would be very hard to grind I think.

13:35:39
Debbi
If someone suffers from diverticulosis, are the chia seeds OK to use?

13:36:43
deedee
Yes, anything that is a binder (chlorella, chlorophyll, bentonite) is good to take before the coffee enema (about 20 min. is good).

13:37:05
Pamela B
Are you saying that caffeine from coffee enema affects the body in the same way as if it were taken orally?

13:38:05
deedee
Sreid, you want to always do a cleansing enema (enema with sea salt, soap, essential oil, etc.), as large as you can, before the coffee enema.

13:38:14
deedee
You do not want toxins from the colon to be absorbed back into the system along with the coffee - defeats the purpose of the coffee enema...

13:39:03
deedee
Some people sensitive to caffeine can have the buzz effect. Also, if it is taken too strong at first, that can have that effect.

13:39:20
nicolasdk
Should the water come out clear from the cleansing enema before taking the coffee enema?

13:40:08
deedee
Chia seeds may be hard for those with diverticulosis - I would stick with one of the other mentioned binders in that case.......

13:41:03
deedee
The clearer the water the better, though sometimes that is hard to get at first.  After doing enemas for a while, you colon should be cleaner in general.

13:41:47
Debbi
OK... Are you speaking of internally taking the chia or orally?

13:42:36
deedee
Nicolas, yes, you could definitely do an enema later after the coffee one to help get rid of the toxins from the coffee enema.  That is why the binders help also.

13:42:42
Pamela B
Orally, like the product, Mama Chia... or you can soak them in a blend of water/juice overnight.

13:42:46
deedee
Take the chia orally.

13:43:09
Larry
When you say &quot;later&quot;... how much later?

13:43:11
Debbi
OK...but not for the divertic folks... got it.

13:43:38
deedee
Hi Larry. I lost track of what question you are responding to.

13:44:00
Larry
After the enema for the coffee enema. 

13:44:18
deedee
Do the coffee enema as soon as you empty from the cleansing ones.

13:44:29
nicolasdk
How much water should be used for the coffee enema?

13:44:30
deedee
Hi Carl.

13:44:44
Larry
Right, but how much later for the one to flush out toxins from the coffee enema?

13:45:09
Carl
Hi, I wasn't seeing any net chats for about 15 minutes.

13:45:15
deedee
When I start people out with coffee enemas, I generally start with 2 cups of water and 1/2 to 1 tablespoon of ground coffee.  Hold for 12-15 min.

13:46:01
herman
Sorry, I just had to walk the puppy at the dog beach.

13:46:26
deedee
3-4 hours later.

13:46:39
deedee
Hi Herman - sounds lovely!

13:46:48
Larry
Got it... thanks... that's about how long I wait.

13:46:56
deedee
What kind of puppy?

13:47:19
Pamela B
This is very good information for those beginning coffee enema... to use a less concentrated solution.  Thanks.

13:47:36
herman
Yes, it was a beautiful day and I have Vizsla Pup.

13:48:02
deedee
I find that works well with me and clients just starting out with coffee enemas.

13:48:33
deedee
Those are beautiful dogs.

13:49:01
Larry
Quick one about the coffee enema... I normally use the 12-15 min. time to clean equipment and put things away rather than just remaining on my left side.  Does it make much difference?

13:49:04
DaveC
Coffee enemas can be more relaxing than standard soap and water, regardless of caffeine.

13:49:17
herman
Yes, they are. Mine sleeps with me

13:49:26
Pamela B
Gorgeous day here, in Little Rock.  Is the sun shining in Madison?

13:50:16
deedee
Good question, Larry. You do want the absorption to occur in upper left side - so I wonder if that coffee flows back low once you get up.  Absorption does still occur in the lower part though also, so if it seems to be working fine for you.

13:50:51
sreid
DeeDee, you recommend using soap and water before doing coffee enema. What type of soap should I use?

13:51:15
deedee
We do have some sun here in Madison.  I was really spoiled by the higher temps a week or two ago, but only in the 50's today - more seasonal.

13:51:27
Larry
I do daily coffee enema whenever I'm on the chemo and to be honest I don't see much difference in remaining flat or getting up to move around.

13:52:24
deedee
Sreid, we recommend Dr. Bronner's castile soap, or we have a fabulous goat milk soap in bar form that you can soak in some water first and then use in the enema. Chamomile and Sage  or Frankincense and Myrrh.   The F&amp;M is great for the prostate too.

13:52:25
nicolasdk
Doing an enema starting on the left side is the best, correct?

13:52:40
Debbi
Go Packers... in and out of season!

13:52:41
nicolasdk
When doing a coffee enema, should one start on the left side as well?

13:53:16
deedee
Yes, I prefer to start folks out on their left side - but some people are more comfortable in other positions, so if that is the case, go with what is comfortable for you

13:53:27
Larry
Debbi... amen... go pack go!!

13:53:47
Pamela B
Just want to let y'all know how much I've appreciated this session.  So many issues have been clarified during this session.

13:54:14
deedee
Do Packers do enemas I wonder?!!

13:54:14
Debbi
Largest fan base in the NFL!  By the way, DeeDee, what is your take on the HCG method of dieting?

13:54:27
Larry
Hope you get these posted  asap since I missed the first half about the binders.

13:55:18
Pamela B
Just for the record, there are lots of Packer fans in the mid-south!!  And lots of Harley-Davidson enthusiasts, as well.

13:55:30
deedee
I have helped many people through the HCG diet and have also done an amount of research on it.  It does seem very safe for most people.  You do have to be commited to following it very closely or it will not work.  Balancing hormones is the key.

13:55:33
DaveC
Do cheeseheads make you constipated, and thus need OHC?

13:55:42
Carl
I hope to see this session posted also since I missed part of it.

13:55:59
Larry
Yes they do... at least twice per season.  One at Green Bay and one at Soldier Field!! LOL

13:56:00
deedee
Many people have such a hard time losing weight because of their hormones.  This can definitely help those who struggle with that.

13:56:01
Debbi
Packers, enemas... the new NFL team...

13:56:15
Debbi
How often should the hormones be checked, since they fluctuate?

13:56:25
deedee
Hi Carl, you will see it posted - definitely!

13:56:46
deedee
Such humorous people we have!!

13:56:50
Pamela B
What is OHC?

13:57:01
Debbi
Enemas... newest team in the newly-formed OHC!

13:57:39
deedee
Optimal Health Center, which is our clinic.

13:57:42
Carl
Thanks. Last archive post I see is March 7.

13:58:15
Pamela B
Oh, silly me!

13:58:21
deedee
I think our guy that posts the newsletters has been out of the country, so he is probably behind so to speak!

13:58:46
Larry
Good one, DeeDee!

13:58:52
Debbi
A tight end!

13:59:09
DaveC
Did we have chats last 3 weeks? Tried to log in but no go.

13:59:09
deedee
Debbi, what hormones are you referring to?  Adrenals, thyroid, female, male?

13:59:38
nicolasdk
When doing a cleansing enema, do you recommend changing sides? Starting from left, after 10 minutes, laying on back, then on right side, then on stomach?

14:00:04
nicolasdk
Same thing for a coffee enema?

14:00:08
Debbi
I guess the balance of the progesterone, testosterone, and estrogen.  Heard they decline at a rate of 1 (to 3?) percent per year, right?

14:00:15
nicolasdk
or for the coffee enema just stay on left side?

14:00:20
deedee
I am trying to rememeber when the last chat was.

14:00:25
deedee
Kristina was going to take one over for me because I had an emergency client, but I don't think it worked for her.  Last week I was on briefly,  but no one came on because the announcement never went out.

14:00:26
Bonita W
Thanks everyone, good information... Just placed an order and can't wait to get started with being more healthy... 

14:00:28
herman
You ought to name the new team the VisEnemalol lol 

14:00:50
sreid
Thanks, DeeDee.

14:00:54
Larry
I normally start left and move to back but I'd need a 20' hose if I rolled all the way over.

14:01:08
Carl
Thanks DeeDee. Bye.

14:01:57
deedee
Nicolas, you really do not have to move around that much.  Left side to back is fine.  I do not think stomach is too comfortable, but you go with what works for you.  Coffee can be done on left side and back.

14:02:19
nicolasdk
OK.

14:02:26
DaveC
Thanks, look for an email before weekend.

14:02:27
Larry
Thanks for the chat, DeeDee...catch you in two weeks. 

14:02:48
nicolasdk
I was thinking if I am doing a 4 quart enema, I would rotate to get water to the end of the colon.

14:02:50
herman
Bye DeeDee.

14:03:03
Debbi
I'd like to increase the testosterone to have more lean muscle mass - get rid of the estrogen &quot;halo&quot; I call it.

14:03:11
deedee
Debbi, I would do an initial check on all hormones, and then depending on the issues and if you go onto a protocol or not, twice a year if there are issues - more if there are major issues.

14:03:32
Debbi
I'm going to be having it done with you all soon.

14:03:39
deedee
Thank you, everyone!  It was such a pleasure and good turnout.  Good luck with your equipment, Bonita.

14:04:09
Bonita W
Thanks. Bye for now...

14:04:25
deedee
Hi Lee. You must be in a different time zone.  We are just finishing up, but hope to see you next time.

14:04:34
herman
Thank you all.

14:04:41
Debbi
Thank you, DeeDee, and when you get the new hormone bracket up, we'll all pick a team! You're a good sport...and we think the OHC is the best!

14:04:50
nicolasdk
Thanks for the tips!

14:05:22
Debbi
What are the hormone tests I need to take, so I can plan?

14:05:23
deedee
Nicolas, if you are doing a large enema like that, it will definitely get to the whole colon.

14:05:43
Debbi
By name, if possible, so I'll pick the right ones.

14:05:54
deedee
How old are you, Debbi?  We can also talk more through email  if you'd like.

14:06:02
herman
Once again, thank for the many tips and advice, DeeDee.

14:06:11
deedee
Thank you Herman.

14:06:28
Debbi
57

14:06:44
Debbi
Wow...that's old for a football player, eh?

14:06:52
deedee
Gotta go to get ready for my next client coming in shortly.  You all have a blessed Easter weekend!

14:07:17
Debbi
OK, will e-mail... Thank you and you also be blessed this Easter-Resurrection weekend!
