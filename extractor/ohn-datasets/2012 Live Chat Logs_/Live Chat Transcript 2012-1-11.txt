Hi, happy to make it this time.

Welcome, Dave, Carl, Paul.

13:05:14
deedee
How is everyone today?   I am a little disappointed that we may be getting a snow store tonight and tomorrow.  I was getting a little spoiled with our mild winter so far.

13:05:32
deedee
Welcome, Dan.

13:05:44
deedee
Welcome, Steve.

13:05:52
deedee
Welcome, Slu.

Hi DeeDee.

13:06:02
deedee
Welcome, Rita.

13:06:05

Thank you. Hi DeeDee.

13:06:27
DaveC
Meant to ask you about weather. Holding off Midwest trips to late March.

13:06:38
deedee
Any subjects we would like to cover today?  I do have a recommendation from last chat to talk about allergies and high blood pressure.

13:07:44
DanH
I have a quick question about how to acquire your suppository trays.  I couldn't find them on your website.

13:08:52
deedee
Scientific studies show that over 50% of our immune system is in our colon. There is a tremendous amount of immune tissues called lymphoid aggregates.

13:08:52
deedee
Through these tissues, the colon plays a key role in responding to infection and antigenic challenges.

13:09:43
deedee
Hi Dan. The item number on the suppository trays is 414  and if you type in the word tray or oil in the product search box, they will come up also.

13:10:46
DanH
Thanks, DeeDee.

13:13:55
deedee
Because our digestive system/colon is an important part of our immune system, keeping those areas healthy would be necessary for overall immune system health.

13:13:55
deedee
We know our immune system plays a huge role when it comes to allergies - to toxins in the environment.

13:15:22
deedee
Our colons and liver are what filters out the toxic substances that create allergic reactions.  I have found using a blend of essential oils in the colon (and other parts of the body also) helps to boost immune system and decrease allergic reactions.

13:18:16
howard
Happy New Year. Sorry that I missed the last chat.

13:18:34
deedee
Welcome, Howard.

13:20:44
howard
My doctor welcomes the enema and diet regimens that are in the book.

13:20:49
deedee
Howard, that is great!

13:21:18
deedee
There are some health providers out there who really get it!

13:22:52
DaveC
Cleansing can be positive on both the purely clinical level and otherwise.

13:23:49
deedee
Is the person that had questions about immunity and high blood pressure on chat today?

13:24:36
slu k
I have high cholesteral and high blood pressure, taking medications for both...

13:24:36
howard
This doctor is real key and knowable.

13:24:38
Carl W
I am interested in discussing BP since I have been on BP meds for years.

13:26:29
deedee
Some of the essential oils found to be beneficial for allergies that you could add to your enema water or use in an implant are lavender, sedum, Roman chamomile, and nutmeg.

13:27:17
slu k
Is regular chamomile the same as Roman chamomile?

13:28:12
deedee
For both high blood pressure and high cholesterol, there are natural supplements that I have used with people that do work, and also there are essential oil blends to try and see if we can get changes that way.

13:28:58
deedee
For high blood pressure, lavender, goldenrod, clove, Roman chamomile, ylang ylang, and cypress would be great.

13:29:14
Carl W
What natural supplements have you used with other people that worked?

13:29:47
deedee
For high cholesterol, rosemary, clove, Roman chamomile, spikenard, and nutmeg.

13:31:03
slu k
Is regular chamomile the same as Roman chamomile?

13:33:15
deedee
There are a couple different types of chamomile - I know of German and Roman.  I think they are very similar, but may have a few different properties.

13:35:38
deedee
Carl, I have used Coleus Forte herb, garlic, hawthorn, Cyruta, and Cardio-Plus (different supplements and herbs we use).

13:35:38
deedee
I have just recently started adding the oils in also for this.

13:36:52
Carl W
I am taking Cardio-Plus which was recommended by my MD.

13:38:13
deedee
Carl, how is that working for you?  That is a Standard Process supplement, so I am glad that an MD is using it for his patients!!

13:38:53
Carl W
I suppose it helps, but I am still taking a lot more.

13:39:07
deedee
You're welcome.  Slu, did you see my answer about the chamomile?

13:39:19
Carl W
BP meds than I would like.

13:39:56
slu k
Yes, thank you very much, DeeDee.

13:40:08
deedee
About the chamomile, the essential oil we have is Roman, and the chamomile in liquid herb form does not specifiy the origin.

13:41:12
deedee
Carl, we could definitely enhance that protocol.  I know you just started using the essential oil blend for this, right?  We could add some herbs to your protocol also to help you get off of the meds. Also, if anyone ever wants a more thorough discussion with me regarding their health, we can set up a phone consultation.

13:43:43
Carl W
Yes, I did start using an EO BP blend that you made for me. I am taking a lot of Standard Process supplements recommended by my MD.

13:44:25
deedee
What else are you taking, Carl?

13:46:30
Carl W
Cyrofood, Pneumotrophin, Drenamin, Chezyn, Palma, Palmettoplex, Min_chex

13:47:29
deedee
Carl, you are taking some good things. Hopefully with the oils added in now, you will start seeing some changes so that you can wean off meds.

13:47:55
Carl W
Cholaplex, Cyruta, Trace Minerals-B12, A-F Betafood

13:48:31
deedee
Carl, I am glad you are willing to go with the natural approach as much as possible.

13:48:49
Carl W
I am taking the BP blend suppositories ever other day. Is that about right?

13:49:07
deedee
Yes, Carl, that is great! 

13:50:13
deedee
Any health/cleansing topics that any of you would like to see discussed at another chat?

13:50:36
DaveC
Anyone hear of Via Viente, a multi-fruit puree that my colon therapist swears by?

13:50:48
deedee
On that note too, there will not be a chat next week.  I am guest speaking next Wednesday.

13:51:35
deedee
Dave, I have not heard of that.  I will have to Google it. 

13:52:49
DaveC
Thanks, no hurry.

13:52:58
deedee
It looks like a mixture of fruits and herbs.  Very interesting.  What benefits does she talk about?

13:53:19
howard
Yes, DeeDee. I use enemas for arthritis and prostrate as laid out in 10 Days to Optimal Health.

13:54:04
DaveC
EVERYTHING, so I'm just a little skeptical.

13:54:52
deedee
Howard, that is great.  So, you are using coffee also?  Coffee is great for that.  And the frankincense and myrrh, among other things is great for the prostate.

13:54:53
DaveC
Tastes good anyway.

13:56:17
deedee
People are very passionate about the products that they feel work well.  I am sure she is a marketer of it also.

13:57:22
Carl W
It seems to be very expensive - 3 bottles for $111.

13:58:11
deedee
Yes, things like that are not cheap, are they?  You just hope that they use quality ingredients and at a therapeutic level of them.

13:58:53
DaveC
Thanks for your input.

13:59:23
deedee
I didn't look at it that closely, so it may be an amazing product! 

14:00:50
deedee
I am being approached often by people with all different kinds of products by different companies, etc.  It is hard to know what is good or not, and very time-consuming sometimes to really look carefully into them.

14:01:27
DaveC
Good thought. Hope we're all back here in 2 weeks.

14:01:47
deedee
Well, I hope you all join me the next time (I think Wed. Jan. 25 is next time), but just check you emails or the website for the date/time.

14:01:55
howard
Yes I am using coffee enemas which I use with herbal tea, and I use the goat's milk soap.

14:02:15
DanH
Thanks for your time, DeeDee. Hope your guest speaking engagement goes well.  Bye!

14:02:15
Carl W
Thanks, DeeDee. Bye.

14:02:59
deedee
Thank you, Dan.  Goodbye, everyone.  

14:03:32

Good bye, DeeDee... Thank you for all your help....

14:04:10

Thank you all!
