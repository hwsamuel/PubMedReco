Hi DeeDee.

13:03:39
deedee
Welcome, Dan &amp; Victoria.

13:03:45
deedee
What is the article you found?

13:04:05
deedee
Welcome, tkoster.

13:04:25
deedee
Welcome, Carl.

13:04:41
CarlW
Thanks, DeeDee.

I have been dealing with prostatitis for a year, and have been on antibiotics for 6 months. Any suggestions?

13:05:23
clintc
Hi DeeDee. Found an interesting article:

13:05:37
clintc
http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2002/mar/09/restandrelaxation.shopping

13:05:46
deedee
I apologize for not being able to open chat last week.  We updated and changed some of our system, so it was quite confusing for a bit, but we are learning.

13:06:03
clintc
or google &quot;the enema within&quot;. It is the first hit (in the Guardian).

13:06:54

Hi.

13:07:11
nicolasdk
I was wondering what the flex tips are made of.

13:07:20
Victoria
Any thoughts on using green tea liquid caps by Gaia?

13:07:21
clintc
DeeDee, does your Vit-Ra-Tox package include Whole Beet Plant Juice Tablets?

13:07:34
deedee
Tkoster, I would suggest this strong probiotic that we offer called PROBiotic 225. It works to re-establish good bacteria and is very potent.  You only use it for 15 days at a time.

13:09:25
DaveC
Any specific probiotic to target the colon after colonic/enema series?

13:09:56
deedee
For the prostate, I recommend the prostarol forte that we offer and suppositories made from essential oils and coconut oil that we also offer.

13:10:26
tkoster
Thanks for the help. Also my testosterone level is low and they started my on daily application of medication. The concern I have is the side effects. Do you have any suggestions for a natural way to boost testosterone level? 

13:10:32
deedee
The flex tips are made from plastisol.

13:10:41
nicolasdk
I made an order last Friday and want to track my package.  Where can I see this?

13:11:12
deedee
You can also use a probiotic implant either in water or in the coconut oil.

13:11:22
clintc
Still on my raw juice fast. Day 36 (of 62?).

13:11:38
clintc
Do one coffee enema nearly every day.

13:11:57
DaveC
Does the suppo ingredient make it up high enough for prostate  area to work?

13:12:00
nicolasdk
Is plastisol essentially plastic?

13:12:20
nicolasdk
How does it compare to the silicone?

13:12:30
clintc
The flex tips feel like rubber.

13:12:34
deedee
To increase testosterone, we use tribulus, but I would want to talk with you first in a consult to determine what else.

13:12:51
deedee
Clint - that is great!  A long time! 

13:13:37
deedee
Dave, yes, since you can feel the prostate with you finger, you would just push it up that high.

13:13:46
tkoster
Thank you. I will contact you to further discuss.

13:13:55
deedee
Yes, plastisol is plastic - it is a softer, flexible plastic.

13:13:59
CarlW
I am taking essential oil suppositories for my prostate issues. What are reasons for women taking EO suppositories? My colon therapist asked me that.

13:15:41
deedee
Suppositories can be made up for all different kinds of issues - IBS, hemorrhoids, fissures, yeast, and the list goes on - since oils are absorbed into the entire system and can cross the blood/brain barrier.

13:16:13
deedee
Silicone is considered the most non-toxic.

13:16:26
clintc
Are the frozen suppositories uncomfortable to insert?

13:17:21
CarlW
I don't find them to be uncomfortable.

13:17:27
deedee
Nicola, you should have received an email with info.  You can also sign into your account again and click on &quot;review orders/track packages in your account&quot;.

13:18:32
clintc
Is it like inserting an ice cube?

13:19:08
deedee
Victoria, I am not real familiar with those green tea capsules, but I couldn't see why you couldn't use them.

13:19:35
clintc
DeeDee, my order from last Thursday still does not have a tracking number. Any estimate when the Vit-Ra-Tox will arrive?

13:19:45
DaveC
Thanks, DeeDee. We'll proceed on that down the road, happily.

13:19:57
deedee
Please resubmit your question if I didn't get to it - it disappears if I don't get to it quick enough.

13:19:59
CarlW
Not sure. I have never inserted an ice cube, but I definitely don't find it to be uncomfortable.

13:21:32
CarlW
I use an EO suppository every other day for my prostate, and it has done wonders for me.

13:21:56
deedee
We use rounded smaller trays that we offer on our website.  They are quite comfortable and you keep them in the fridge, so they aren't too cold.

13:23:03
clintc
EO = poly(ethylene oxide)?

13:23:10
deedee
Clint, your Vit-Ra-Tox is on back order, but we hope to get them in by Friday.

13:23:24
clintc
Great. Thanks.

13:23:25
CarlW
EO = essential oil

13:23:44
clintc
Which essential oil?

13:24:14
CarlW
A blend of 6 oils that DeeDee made up for me.

13:24:22
tkoster
Carl, what is it that you have noticed a change in using the EO suppositories? Less pain, more energy, or better sex drive?

13:24:36
deedee
Hi Debbie. Did I just talk to you?

13:24:49
clintc
DeeDee, does your Vit-Ra-Tox include the Whole Beet Plant Juice tablets?

13:25:02
clintc
Thanks, Carl.

13:25:19
DaveC
Will look for similar ice trays meantime.

13:25:34
CarlW
Mainly fewer nightly trips to the bathroom. I went from about 4 or 5 per night to 1 or 2 per night.

13:25:47
deedee
Clint, how are those coffee enemas going?  Are you experiencing anything different?

13:26:07
deedee
No, our Vit-Ra-Tox does not include the beet tabs.

13:26:14
clintc
Not really. Becoming a little more proficient at expelling them.

13:26:23
tkoster
Thank you, Carl.

13:26:28
clintc
I think the key is to do them really slow.

13:26:45
deedee
Yes, doing them slow seems to be very effective.

13:26:45
clintc
Inserting the enema and letting the water in.

13:27:18
clintc
Once the silicone tube with holes didn't let any water out.

13:28:03
deedee
Most of the time when water does not flow through a tube, etc., there is a air bubble in it that you have to work out first.

13:28:13
clintc
That was a problem. But I took it out and put the Higginson bulb on it and it worked great.

13:28:18
clintc
Oh.

13:28:52
deedee
Great!  I am glad the pump worked well.  The pump is very handy in getting water up higher and more comfortably.

13:29:17
clintc
The flowmeter I got from your website is also very useful.

13:29:47
clintc
The only thing more useful would be a digital meter on it which displayed how much liquid had flowed through it.

13:30:09
clintc
I found such a device on Amazon, but the reviews all said it did not work.

13:30:38
deedee
I have had several questions lately on the best way to clean enema equipment.  We recommend hot soapy water and then soaking in grapefruit seed extract and water or Thieves oil and water.  What do you all use that you find works well?

13:31:04
clintc
The castile soap seems to work for me.

13:31:23
deedee
Clint, yes, a meter would be nice, but a clear bag works well too.

13:31:29
CarlW
Castile soap is what I use also.

13:32:33
clintc
I already invested in your large coffee enema bucket, but the meter would be more precise than eyeballing a clear bag.

13:32:38
deedee
I really like to disinfect with the Thieves oil and Thieves cleaner.  It smells so good!  I also love the Thieves spray which has saved us from sore throats this winter.

13:33:09
deedee
Clint, I agree.  Are you an inventor?  or engineer?

13:34:58
DaveC
Sounds good for cleansing. In old days there was an enamel-coated enema can that sanitized easily.

13:35:01
clintc
No. I do having a degree in engineering, but am studying ancient Chinese now.

13:35:43
clintc
I found the movie that inspired my juice fast online. Here is a link in case anyone has not seen it:

13:35:46
clintc
http://www.tudou.com/programs/view/XfEziCWfmLg/

13:36:37
deedee
Well, if you ever have time, maybe you could think of something that would work.  I had a client mark something that floated and put that in his bucket so that as the water went down and it sank, the marks would indicate the level.

13:36:56
deedee
Thank you, Clint.

13:37:21
deedee
I have seen it, but definitely worth watching again!!

13:37:37
clintc
There is also a really interesting movie done in response to Morgan Spurlock's Supersize Me.

13:37:57
clintc
It is about a guy who eats at McDs for 30 days and loses 20 lbs.

13:38:09
deedee
What was he eating?

13:38:29
clintc
It is called Fat Head. He ate mostly burgers (no buns) and fries.

13:39:02
clintc
Here is a link. It is a serious documentary:

13:39:04
clintc
http://www.tudou.com/programs/view/3ecC-4O5k2g/

13:39:54
deedee
The quality would not be good, of course, but when people get rid of grains and up their protein, they generally lose weight.

13:40:00
clintc
But I think forks over knives is the most reliable.

13:40:31
clintc
My doctor thinks that losing weight alone is responsible for most of the curing done by juice fasting.

13:41:13
clintc
At any rate, using organic produce is really expensive. About $30/day.

13:41:30
clintc
Here in Boston, at least.

13:41:39
deedee
Yes, excess weight does bring with it a variety of problems.  Bad digestion/elimination is another culprit that creates a lot of health issues, as we all know!

13:42:35
deedee
Expense is one of the reasons I went from juicing to emulsifying.

13:42:46
deedee
Hi Joseph.

13:42:48
clintc
Is it okay to do a coffee enema without first doing a water enema (or two as Kristina recommends)?

13:43:03
joseph
Hi DeeDee.

13:43:11
joseph
I popped in, lol.

13:43:32
deedee
No, I would never recommend doing coffee without first cleaning the toxins out of the colon, otherwise you are just re-absorbing toxins along with the coffee which is supposed to be detoxifying.

13:44:24
clintc
So when doing a coffee enema, we only use one quart because we only want it to go into the descending colon?

13:45:07
clintc
So we remain on our left side and not on our back or right side, nor do we massage the colon beyond the descending colon?

13:46:01
CarlW
I thought we want the coffee to be in the ascending colon.

13:46:21
clintc
I have not found anything in the Gerson literature about doing a preliminary water enema (or two). Is one prior water enema sufficient?

13:46:35
deedee
Yes, the maximum I would use would be 1 quart of the coffee mixture.  Keeping it lower is key.

13:46:39
clintc
And do we need more than one quart of water?

13:47:04
clintc
Keeping it lower = keeping it in the descending colon?

13:47:17
deedee
You can lie on left side or back.  You do not need to massage past descending.

13:48:28
clintc
Kristina's protocol as I understood it from the videos was 3-4 quarts or water, then 1 quart of water, then 1 quart of coffee. Is that right?

13:48:59
deedee
Gerson never went into cleansing the colon first - I am not sure why they didn't talk about that, but I am going to be meeting with Dr. Vickers who worked under Dr. Gerson - I will ask him about it.

13:49:14
clintc
Great. Thanks.

13:49:25
DaveC
Whatever position aids retention of the coffee for 15 mins or so seems best, at least for me.

13:49:46
deedee
Yes, keep in descending colon - if you are in a hurry, you can do one good 2 3 quart cleansing enema  before coffee.

13:50:25
clintc
If we do a 2nd water enema before the coffee, should we use 1 quart of water?

13:50:33
clintc
or 2-3 quarts?

13:50:39
deedee
Yes, Dave, good point - we just don't want it going too far up, but if you keep the amount smaller, you shouldn't have the issue of it going up too far.

13:51:15
deedee
You can use one or more quarts of water before the coffee - more water cleans out more of the colon.

13:52:00
clintc
But it seems that if we are only putting coffee into the descending colon, then 1 quart of water should be sufficient to clean it out?

13:53:04
tkoster
Signing off, you all have a good day!

13:53:16
DaveC
I can attest to proof of that, lol.

13:53:34
deedee
Our goal is to clean out as much of the colon as we can for detoxification purposes.

13:53:46
deedee
Thank you, tkoster.

13:54:25
clintc
Thanks, DeeDee. You mentioned Dr. Vickers. Is that Dr. Patrick Vickers?

13:54:39
deedee
Victoria or Debbie, do you want to weigh in on anything or do you have any questions?

13:55:26
deedee
Yes, Dr. Patrick Vickers.

13:56:19
clintc
Thanks for another great chat, DeeDee. I look forward to reporting my results with the Vit-Ra-Tox. Take care. Bye.

13:56:42
deedee
Thank you Clint - I will be interested on how your cleanse goes.

13:57:18
joseph
You enjoying any of the great weather, DeeDee?

13:57:22
Victoria
I find green tea with soap very quenches all days!

13:57:47
joseph
I'll have to give that a shot.

13:58:38
deedee
Thank you for the info about the green tea capsules.  I will have to look at those.  Is is very energizing for you?

13:59:43
Victoria
Best I've found! 

14:00:04
deedee
Thank you again, everyone, for joining me today.  I hope to hear from you all next time!

14:00:45
DaveC
Happy health trails, DeeDee and all.

14:01:51
deedee
Good bye all - until next time. Hope everyone else is having such great weather!
