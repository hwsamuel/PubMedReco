Hey DeeDee. 

13:04:06
  deedee
Hi Randy. How are you?

13:04:13
  deedee
Welcome Bob!

13:04:19
  randyu
Did you get my email?  I am OK, I guess...

13:04:20
  Bob L.
Hi DeeDee.

13:04:20
  deedee
Hi Dave!

13:04:58
  deedee
Randy, I did get your email, but have been with clients all day, so haven't been able to think about it yet.  I know there are natural things we can do.

13:05:00
  DaveC
Long time, no chat. Happy to be back.

13:05:23
  deedee
Cleansing is just fine for that, but let me think of some oils that may work well with the water for that.

13:05:35
  Bob L.
Have a question on one of your products, DeeDee. 

13:05:54
  randyu
OK, DeeDee, I think I am going to cleanse right now, if that's OK with you?

13:05:55
  DaveC
Keith is a newbie,  referred by me.

13:06:18
  randyu
I need to try something...

13:06:18
  deedee
Welcome Keith.

13:06:20
  keithw
Thanks, Dave.

13:06:50
  keithw
Hi all.

13:07:08
  deedee
OK, Randy - have a good cleanse.

13:07:30
  deedee
Any particular questions to start us off, Keith?

13:07:33
  Bob L.
Question re the Flowmaster kit with inflatable retention nozzle...

13:07:52
  deedee
Go ahead, Bob.

13:08:01
  randyu
Take care all. Thanks DeeDee.

13:08:16
  Bob L.
Explain how the retention works if you would... is the inflator inside the rectum? Assume it must be.

13:08:23
  deedee
Talk to you later, Randy, about some oils.

13:08:35
  randyu
Later - bye.

13:08:43
  Bob L.
Is that the small device in the photo on your website?

13:09:05
  Bob L.
that fits around the rectal nozzle?

13:09:18
  deedee
Bob, first you insert the nozzle, then you inflate inside the rectum and clamp it.  When you are done, deflate and remove.

13:10:03
  Bob L.
So that prevents the nozzle from slipping out of the rectum... an occasional problem with that type nozzle?

13:10:26
  deedee
It is a peach nozzle with white square inflator pillow and orange clamp.

13:11:05
  Bob L.
Guess you just press the square gadget to inflate the retention ring... and what is the retention ring made of?

13:11:22
  keithw
DeeDee, no questions from me right now.  Just want to see what's going on.  Thanks.

13:11:50
  deedee
Yes, you squeeze the pillow and while squeezing it, clamp it off.  The balloon is made of silicone, I believe.

13:12:20
  Bob L.
That's sounds super... Have not ever seen an arrangement like that.

13:12:46
  deedee
Has anyone viewed our newest videos yet?

13:13:43
  Bob L.
Yes... a couple.

13:13:53
  DaveC
Saw your one of tubing, etc.

13:15:23
  deedee
They are somewhat raw - unrehearsed, but hopefully informative and effective.

13:15:27
  DaveC
Is there a list on the website of the videos, for easy reference?

13:16:21
  deedee
We are revamping the entire website and it will be much clearer on how to find things, but if you go under OHN Library and click on Alternative Health Videos. They will all be there with titles so you know which one is which.

13:17:43
  DaveC
Enema care is a &quot;lost art&quot; and needs all the explanation possible. Fortunately it survives in some places.

13:18:07
  DaveC
Sounds fine, DeeDee.

13:19:02
  Bob L.
Is shipping included in price of that Flowmaster with retention ring?

13:19:16
  deedee
Do any of you have a particular subject to talk about today?

13:19:42
  deedee
Bob, shipping is extra.   We give free shipping for orders over $150.

13:20:08
  deedee
Bob, sorry, yes, for the Flowmaster, shipping would be free.

13:20:09
  Bob L.
Well, certainly applies to the Flowmaster - $245 then.

13:20:24
  deedee
Yes, sorry I misunderstood your question.

13:20:26
  Bob L.
Sorry we typed same time.

13:20:32
  Bob L.
Haha.

13:21:01
  Bob L.
Correction - $225

13:21:02
  deedee
How is the weather by you all? It is supposed to be in high 90s here today.

13:21:13
  Bob L.
Ditto in Kansas.

13:21:20
  DaveC
Among clients, is colon care pretty much a seasonal &quot;spring cleaning&quot; process or year round?

13:21:33
  Bob L.
Year round here.

13:21:42
  keithw
Currently 87 on thermometer here in AL but feels much hotter.

13:21:59
  Bill D
Hi all!  Bill D here!

13:22:09
  deedee
I was just at a convention for colon therapy in Chicago this past Friday. It was weird how shocked other people were that we were using therapeutic oils, etc., in the enema/colonic water.  They haven't progressed into that yet, I guess.

13:22:17
  deedee
Welcome Bill.

13:22:20
  DaveC
We'll love that global warming next winter, lol.

13:22:23
  Bob L.
Weekly or every other week together with massage therapy.

13:23:20
  deedee
Welcome Timothy.

13:23:29
  Timothy D
Hi DeeDee. 

13:23:41
  DaveC
DeeDee, as I recall, enemas as an alternative were sort of a taboo in your training?

13:23:55
  Bill D
Love all the videos you and Kris have in the new newsletter, especially the &quot;You can do it!&quot; documentary!

13:24:29
  deedee
Yes, enemas are a little outside of their box, but even in colon therapy, many were amazed and shocked that we use oils, etc. in the water.

13:24:51
  deedee
Thanks Bill!

13:25:09
  DaveC
I'm having problems getting the newsletter. Is the latest one out this month already?

13:26:18
  Timothy D
I got it in my email. That's how I found out about this chat.

13:26:46
  DaveC
I'll email you, DeeDee, re the newsletter. Maybe an address problem.

13:26:53
  deedee
Yes, Dave.  Not sure why you are having issues, but email me and I will attach a newsletter for you.

13:27:09
  Bill D
I've been forwarding the newsletters to several friends and my CT!

13:27:14
  DaveC
Thanks much.

13:27:29
  deedee
Thanks, Bill.

13:28:10
  Timothy D
DeeDee, those enemas have helped my back and dizziness issues. The EEG was normal but haven't gotten blood work results back yet from the top leg cramps from sleeping on my side.

13:29:02
  deedee
Timothy, keep us posted on your progress.

13:30:48
  Timothy D
DeeDee, since it's helping with the lower back pain, how often would you recommend I do a sea salt or peppermint oil enema?

13:31:03
  deedee
How often are you doing it now?

13:31:39
  Timothy D
Biweekly or if back pain gets bad enough sometimes more.

13:32:18
  deedee
Yes, you can definitely do it more often.  A couple of times per week if you want.  See if that helps.

13:33:31
  DaveC
Would the back pain actually originate in the colon but feel thjat it a structural issue?

13:34:15
  Timothy D
I'm on 5 different medications for different stuff but wasn't sure because of the types of meds I'm on.

13:35:15
  Timothy D
I don't know. I've only had it since I was lifting my mom from the floor to bed or chair when she had a stroke.

13:35:23
  Bob L.
That's my issue also... one med for each different ailment, and supplements.  Definitely causes the constipation... and need for weekly enemas.

13:35:43
  deedee
Yes, sometimes back pain can originate in the colon, other times not.

13:36:27
  Bob L.
But, in my &quot;old age&quot; and those ailments/meds, I'm finding issues with too frequent enemas.

13:36:36
  deedee
Well, enemas can definitely help with keeping the liver functioning well to deal with all of those medications.

13:36:39
  Timothy D
Thanksgiving 2010 I was doing good. That Friday I started getting weakness on my primary side (left) went to ER because I lost all feeling. Docs ran tests and told me I had bulging disc between c5/c6.

13:36:47
  DaveC
Besides other therapists, are some clients surprised by sea salt,  therapeutic oils, etc., advocated as enema ingredients? Do some recall when Ivory soap was the big favorite, years ago?

13:37:16
  Bob L.
Oh yes.

13:37:58
  deedee
Not a lot of my clients have experienced enemas.  The majority have never had one.  Some people are kind of intrigued about adding things to the water.

13:38:07
  Bob L.
&quot;SSE until clear&quot;... The physician's script.

13:38:14
  Bob L.
SSE being soap suds enema.

13:38:40
  deedee
Do you have an older or younger doctor?

13:38:40
  Timothy D
Dave, what soap do you use to cleanse inside of your enema bag? I bought the Thieves DeeDee suggested but I guess that's only good for soaking it and same for the GSE.

13:38:55
  DaveC
I hear that from other therapists questioned. No background coming in.

13:39:20
  deedee
You can use Dr. Bronner's soap.

13:39:37
  Bill D
Remember the &quot;Soap Suds Fairy&quot; and the smell of Ivory permeating through out the bath?

13:39:56
  Bob L.
I use vinegar, then mild chlorox, with lots of shaking around.

13:40:04
  keithw
And for me the smell of Pond's Cold Cream.

13:40:50
  Bill D
Love Dr B's peppermint... but just a few drops per quart.

13:41:01
  deedee
I do not have any of those experiences!

13:41:48
  keithw
Well of course, you're just an infant compared to some of us.

13:42:03
  Timothy D
Once I get the money saved up, DeeDee, I'm going to switch from my red latex bag to a clear silicone.

13:42:12
  deedee
Hah!  I do feel pretty young, but I am getting up there!

13:42:16
  Bob L.
You're right... I was unknowingly using excessive Dr B's for a long time.

13:42:46
  deedee
Yes, it is best to go a little lightly with the peppermint because it can be strong and intense.

13:42:46
  Bob L.
Timothy, do look at that one I was asking questions about earlier.

13:42:53
  DaveC
Timothy, I use a 10 percent bleach solution, although others may not go with that.

13:44:34
  Timothy D
I have  been cleaning the equipment with dove bar soap then soaking it in 20 drops of GSE and a capful of Thieves cleaner for about 30 min and doing a thourough rinse.

13:44:34
  Bill D
Was a child of the late 40's and into the 50's. Enema bags were displayed in everyone's bathroom! And they got used!

13:46:03
  Bob L.
Bill... me too. Started in the 30s.  Used to sneak an enema when visiting relatives.

13:46:12
  Bill D
Lightly with the peppermint Dr. B's, just a few drops per quart  definitely!

13:46:52
  DaveC
Bill, agree there were not a lot of secrets &quot;back then.&quot;

13:47:15
  Timothy D
I haven't gotten the Dr. Bronner's soap yet. Gotta wait a bit due to money being on SSI - stinks.

13:47:42
  Bob L.
Many years later wife and I went to a social function in a friend's home, and here was a full enema bag hanging in guest bathroom, complete with Vaseline!

13:49:01
  deedee
Well, we have so many stories about enemas, we could write a book I bet!

13:49:18
  Timothy D
lol yep

13:49:19
  Bob L.
For sure.

13:49:48

Title: The E and Me

13:49:49
  Timothy D
I just started a couple months ago.

13:49:50
  deedee
I will have to duck out of chat about 5 min. early today.  I have a client right away at 1:00 and still need to clean my therapy room.  Any questions anyone wants to get in?

13:50:17
  Bill D
DeeDee, your and Kris' newsletters are a good start!

13:50:17
  keithw
None here.  Have found this very interesting and will watch for next one.

13:50:21
  Bob L.
Sure appreciate your answering mine about that retention ring on the Flowmaster, DeeDee.

13:50:24
  DaveC
Most kids and their parents today would find the book's content pretty exotic, lol.

13:50:47
  Bill D
C-U next time

13:51:10
  DaveC
Look OK for another chat next week?

13:51:14
  keithw
C-U 2, Bill

13:54:10
  deedee
I think we are having chat next week.  Sorry for a couple weeks of being off.  We had some complications with passwords and one week an emergency client.  Should see you all next week though.  Thank you all for attending today!  Have a good rest of your we

13:54:37
  Timothy D
Hope many show up since it's 4th of July lol.

13:55:00
  deedee
Oh yeah!  I guess no chat next Wed. after all!  Have a good holiday all!
