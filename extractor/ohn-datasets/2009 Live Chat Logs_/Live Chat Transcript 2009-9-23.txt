kristina, did you hear that Ron Tyler died??

13:01:43&nbsp;
Chris H
Hi all

13:01:50&nbsp;
Mike
hey

13:02:12&nbsp;
Chris H
Kristina, I have a question about enemas

13:02:15&nbsp;
kristina
No, I hadn't. 

13:02:21&nbsp;
kristina
Great, go ahead with your questions.

13:02:33&nbsp;
Mike
last week

13:03:26&nbsp;
Lou P
Kristina,  I had hip surgery last month and post-op, I was very constipated for a few weeks.  They gave me laxatives which helped but I'm still not regular.  What type of enema regimen to recommend?

13:03:55&nbsp;
Chris H
I started a weekly enema about a month ago and everything is going great, but this week I did a coffee enema and thought I noticed a odor coming from me few hours later.

13:03:57&nbsp;
kristina
That is too bad. Sorry. Thanks for letting me know.

13:04:02&nbsp;
Chris H
can this be normal?

13:05:33&nbsp;
kristina
We just had a bit of a dog emergency - now I am back

13:05:50&nbsp;
Chris H
did you get my question Kristina?

13:06:04&nbsp;
kristina
Lou, are you aware of taking enemas in series?

13:06:33&nbsp;
Mike
how often (times a week) is it safe to take enemas in a series?

13:06:42&nbsp;
Lou P
Yes, but what with? Do I use a colon tube?

13:06:46&nbsp;
kristina
The coffee enema can stir stored toxins that can take a while to release. The newsletter that is coming out tomorrow talks about that in some detail.

13:07:24&nbsp;
kristina
You may need to take a second coffee enema that day, or do a number of coffee enemas over a week.

13:07:49&nbsp;
Sarah S.
Hi Kristina,  this is my first visit to the chat room.  I was wondering what the proper way to dry the tubing after I take an enema is.

13:07:51&nbsp;
Chris H
and you think that may have caused the odor? it wasn't bad, just different 

13:08:07&nbsp;
kristina
Also, you might use a chlorella or chlorophyll prior to the coffee enema.

13:08:28&nbsp;
Chris H
I did use a chlorella

13:09:31&nbsp;
kristina
How often it is safe to take an enema really depends on the individual. Some people are going to do better with more frequent enemas and others won't. I write about this issue on EnemaBag.com. 

13:09:59&nbsp;
Chris H
is it sweating out the toxins that causes the odor? 

13:10:17&nbsp;
kristina
Also, taking a hair tissue mineral analysis will give you the most accurate information about how often is best for you.

13:11:12&nbsp;
Mike
follow-up on sarah's question..how do I clean tubing and bag?

13:11:17&nbsp;
kristina
Also, experimenting with different frequencies and then paying attention to how you feel can be one of the best guides to how often for you.

13:11:48&nbsp;
Lou P
How do you determine the size and type of colon tube to use for a high colonic?

13:12:35&nbsp;
kristina
It is likely but since I wasn't able to smell the odor, I am not positive. Have you tried again?

13:12:51&nbsp;
Chris H
no, not yet

13:13:04&nbsp;
kristina
You will find the newletter article &quot;Doesn't The Body Cleanse Itself?&quot; quite interesting.

13:13:15&nbsp;
Chris H
thanks

13:13:23&nbsp;
kristina
Where was the odor coming from?

13:13:40&nbsp;
Chris H
from my whole body i think

13:13:44&nbsp;
kristina
When did you use the chlorella?

13:13:56&nbsp;
Chris H
just before the enema 

13:14:03&nbsp;
kristina
Lou, do you want to use a colon tube?

13:14:38&nbsp;
Sarah S.
I can't believe anyone would want to use anything but a colon tube.

13:15:01&nbsp;
Chris H
what is so good about a colon tube?

13:15:34&nbsp;
Lou P
Yes, I've heard its more benefical, but don't know anything about the proper size and material (rubber vs. silicone, etc.)

13:15:50&nbsp;
kristina
An excellent protocol to use in cleaning your enema equipment is to first wash your equipment with Dr. Bonner's Castile Soap and then to soak your enema equipment in grapefruit seed extract.

13:16:38&nbsp;
kristina
Try using the chlorella 90-120 minutes before the enema

13:16:46&nbsp;
Chris H
ok

13:17:02&nbsp;
Chris H
what does the chlorella do?

13:17:08&nbsp;
Dave
I'm starting to use a colon tube at home. The standard issue nozzle is ineffective, even shorter than the old black hard rubber ones some here recall.

13:17:18&nbsp;
kristina
Only use a silicone colon tube. I recommend that you never insert rubber anything into the body.

13:17:47&nbsp;
kristina
Unsafe enema equipment article regarding rubber or latex

13:17:48&nbsp;
Lou P
What size?

13:17:55&nbsp;
Dave
Mine is silicone, from OHN naturally.

13:18:16&nbsp;
kristina
This is good! Please might each of you say what type of nozzle and colon tube you use and why?

13:18:42&nbsp;
Sarah S.
I use the silicon colon tube and find it very easy to insert and comfortable - from OHN of course.

13:18:50&nbsp;
kristina
The enema nozzle or colon tube is simply a tool for allowing the enema solution into the colon.

13:19:11&nbsp;
Chris H
i use the regular soft tip. i'm just getting started and it was with the kit.

13:19:24&nbsp;
kristina
Obviously both enema nozzles and colon tubes both do this job quite well.

13:19:45&nbsp;
Chris H
does one make it easier to retain the fluid?

13:19:48&nbsp;
kristina
And, obviously, colon tubes have the capacity to be inserted more deeply into the colon than most enema nozzles.

13:20:02&nbsp;
Sarah S.
I have the the one with two holes.  didn't know that was a soft tip one.

13:20:28&nbsp;
Lou P
But doesn't the standard nozzle limit the fluid to the lower bowel?

13:20:29&nbsp;
kristina
I believe you mean our flex tip.

13:20:42&nbsp;
Chris H
yes, flex tip

13:21:29&nbsp;
michael b
kristina and fellow chat folks, i wish all a most splendid autumn. 

13:21:35&nbsp;
kristina
No, by taking the enema water into the colon slowly and by using 2-4 quarts of water, an enema nozzle can work as well as a colon tube for getting water deeply into the transverse and ascending colon.

13:21:48&nbsp;
kristina
Hi Michael. Nice to &quot;see&quot; you  here.

13:22:32&nbsp;
kristina
here is a link to an article I wrote called How to Take an Enema.

13:23:13&nbsp;
Sarah S.
Is it okay to massage your abdomen while the colon tube is connected to you?

13:23:32&nbsp;
Dave
Isn't it more a matter of position to get more enema in than the nozzle? Is knee/chest a  good way?

13:23:59&nbsp;
kristina
Also, the DVDs and downloadable videos I have made detail how to allow the enema solution deep into the ascending colon by using a colon tube and/or 2-4 quarts of enema solution and/or a regular nozzle or a retention nozzle.

13:25:17&nbsp;
Chris H
i understand there is a valve at the bottom of the stomach that is supposed to stop digested matter from flowing back into the stomach. can you take in too much fluid and push the valve in the opposite direction?  

13:25:49&nbsp;
kristina
It can be very useful to have at least two nozzles on hand, like a flex tip and also a retention nozzle, for assisting with holding the enema solution, and a colon tube. In clinic, during an enema series, we often use a different nozzle for each enema fill as there are different needs each time we are doing the fill.

13:26:18&nbsp;
Lou P
Colon tubes come in different sizes - how do you determine which one is right without buying and trying them all?

13:26:57&nbsp;
kristina
Fluid retention becomes difficult when the rectal/anal area is triggered to release. You need to avoid this.

13:28:09&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, it is great to massage the abdomen while the colon tube is inserted in your colon.

13:28:48&nbsp;
kristina
The position of your body can help to allow more water into the colon. Changing positions while taking in the water can help too.

13:29:54&nbsp;
kristina
However, given our set-up here, we work on a massage table. we almost always have the client on his or her back during most of the treatment. We choose to let the water into the colon slowly in order to bypass the sensitive area of the colon.

13:30:35&nbsp;
michael b
i missed the last chat - i had to run my cat to the vet, worse than arlo and the wasps.

13:31:38&nbsp;
kristina
No, the pyloric sphincter is never going to be affected by taking an enema or colonic.

13:32:13&nbsp;
Chris H
is the pyloric sphincter the valve i was talking about earlier?

13:32:52&nbsp;
Sarah S.
Is there any way to know that the water has gotten to the other end?  

13:33:03&nbsp;
kristina
The enema solution is not going to travel through the small intestines, which is usually over 20 feet in length in most people.

13:33:23&nbsp;
Chris H
good to know

13:33:38&nbsp;
Mike
I'm sorry - I got called away. kristina, you said 2-4 quarts...I find that anything over 2 qts is very uncomfortable

13:33:41&nbsp;
kristina
However, there is also a valve between the small intestines and the large intestines or the colon called the ileocecal valve.

13:34:28&nbsp;
Chris H
can the ileocecal valve be pushed in the wrong direction? 

13:34:59&nbsp;
Sarah S.
Could fecal matter get stuck there or would the water wash it out and away?

13:35:24&nbsp;
Lou P
If a colon tube is as long as the colon, would that insure that you were getting all the way to the end?

13:35:57&nbsp;
Mike
isn't a colon tube too hard to use by yourself??

13:36:08&nbsp;
kristina
We offer 2 sizes of colon tubes:

13:36:17&nbsp;
kristina
Silicone Colon Tube - Closed End - 32Fr - 30 inch

13:36:37&nbsp;
kristina
and an assortment of Silicone Colon Tube with Delrin Cap - 42 FR

13:37:07&nbsp;
Lou P
What do you recommend?

13:37:14&nbsp;
Mike
42 fr is large. is it safe to use by yourself?

13:37:22&nbsp;
kristina
Most people will want to use the 32 FR colon tube as it is easier to use.

13:37:32&nbsp;
Chris H
how long is 32 and 42 FR?

13:37:55&nbsp;
kristina
Arlo still isn't the same. I guess he needs a dog whisperer to whisper out the wasp haunting?

13:38:18&nbsp;
Dave
2 qts is about my limit too, and equipment usually comes in or near that amount capacity. Size of the person doesn't seem to make a difference, as small people can often take as much or more than bigger folks, a therapist told me. 

13:38:39&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, the pyloric sphincter is the valve between the stomach and the small intestines.

13:39:22&nbsp;
kristina
For some, 2 quarts is as much as is needed. This is fine, as long as one is clearing out as much of the colon as they want to or is the most beneficial.

13:39:54&nbsp;
Mike
you say &quot;as they want&quot; - how can we tell if we are cleaning out enough?

13:40:02&nbsp;
Chris H
can the pyloric sphincter give way from too much fluid and allow fecal matter into the small intestine?

13:42:11&nbsp;
Sarah S.
Would chlorophyll liquid be a good implant?  

13:42:16&nbsp;
kristina
I am still learning about the ileocecal valve myself. I only see its dysfunction being talked about in the alternative health world and not in mainstream medicine, so I am unsure if it can truly be pushed in the wrong direction.

13:42:26&nbsp;
kristina
Here is some information that might be useful to you:

13:42:26&nbsp;
michael b
the ileocecal valve is at the cecum? lots of questions. can larger people safely take more than 4qts. to fill and clean the colon?

13:42:28&nbsp;
kristina
When the ileocecal valve is stuck open, waste products can back up into the small intestine (much like a backed-up kitchen sink drain) disturbing your digestion and also creating unhealthy toxins that are absorbed into the body. Also, if the ileocecal valve is stuck closed, waste products are prevented or constricted from passing into the large intestine.  Unfortunately, this disorder is often overlooked by the medical profession. A dysfunctional ileocecal valve can result in a combination of symptoms.
          
          Ileocecal Valve Syndrome Symptoms:      * Right shoulder pain     * Right side pelvic pain     * Low back pain     * Pain surrounding heart     * Flu symptoms     * Tinnitus     * Nausea     * Syncope / Near syncope     * Headache     * Bad breath     * Face pallor     * Dark circles under eyes     * Dizziness     * Bowel disturbances (diarrhea / constipation)

Causes of Ileocecal Valve Syndrome:      * Dehydration     * Emotional upsets     * How you eat (overeating, eating too frequently, eating too quickly, eating foods you are sensitive to, under-chewing your food)     * Foods you eat (carbonated drinks, alcohol, caffeine, chocolate, raw foods, hot spicy foods)

          Ileocecal Valve Syndrome Treatment Options:      * Chiropractic adjustments     * Applied kinesiology     * Homeopathy     * Temporary elimination diet (for 2 to 3 weeks avoid:           Roughage foods such as: popcorn, nuts, potato chips, pretzels, seeds, whole grains;           raw fruits and vegetables such as: celery, bell peppers, cucumbers, cabbage, carrots, lettuce, tomatoes; spicy foods such as: chili powder, hot peppers, salsas, black and cayenne pepper, paprika, cloves, cinnamon; stimulants such as: liquors, alcoholic drinks, cocoa, chocolate, caffeine products

13:43:37&nbsp;
kristina
The large intestine averages 4.9 feet in length.

13:44:05&nbsp;
kristina
there is no way one is going to get a colon tube all the way to its end. I don't believe that one would want to get a colon tube all the way to the end.

13:45:11&nbsp;
kristina
The goal of the colon cleanse is to get waste and toxins out of the colon. Yes, this does include a process of getting in as well, but I have found it is the enema solution that is best to focus on and not necessarily a piece of equipment.

13:45:24&nbsp;
Dave
The colonoscope goes in that far, but few are eager for that, lol.

13:45:43&nbsp;
kristina
If the enema solution is in the ascending colon, you can usually hear it or feel it by massaging that side of the colon.

13:46:14&nbsp;
kristina
Also, through massage, one can feel or control the release from the ascending colon. I guess this would be a good thing for me to write about in detail.

13:47:30&nbsp;
Lou P
Is the ascending colon where most of the toxic build-up occurs?

13:48:08&nbsp;
Chris H
is a colon tube better to us to not put pressure around the anus?

13:48:31&nbsp;
Chris H
i mean fluid pressure

13:48:44&nbsp;
Dave
Re massage, yes. Every therapist I have been to incorporates some of it in the procedure.

13:48:58&nbsp;
kristina
As a colon hydrotherapist, I continually use my hands and the flow of water to attend to the furthest depths of the colon.

13:50:01&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, the colon tube does make it so the flow of water can be directed into the descending colon and/or the transverse colon.

13:50:37&nbsp;
kristina
Have I missed anyone's questions? You folks were great today, keeping me busy with questions.

13:51:10&nbsp;
Chris H
i can't think of anything else - you were great too.

13:51:15&nbsp;
Lou P
Thanks for your time

13:51:50&nbsp;
Sarah S.
thanks, everyone!

13:52:01&nbsp;
Dave
Ditto.

13:52:03&nbsp;
Chris H
have a good day all

13:52:07&nbsp;
kristina
the next live chat is on Wednesday, October 14th at 7pm. Throughout the winter and spring, we ought to have two live chats each month, second and fourth Wednesday, 7pm and 12noon

13:52:18&nbsp;
kristina
You are very welcome. Thank you.

13:52:39&nbsp;
kristina
I am a bit out of sorts today because one of our clients came in just before the live chat.

13:52:50&nbsp;
kristina
She had a terrible car accident last month.

13:52:56&nbsp;
kristina
She should have died.

13:53:10&nbsp;
kristina
I tend to get a bit shaken up by these things.

13:53:11&nbsp;
Chris H
hopefully she'll be ok

13:53:21&nbsp;
michael b
i am worried that the latest flu shot is being pushed so much, with so little testing.

13:53:32&nbsp;
Dave
In for regular therapy?

13:53:37&nbsp;
kristina
I guess with my brother dying?????

13:53:37&nbsp;
Sarah S.
She's in good hands with you, that's for sure.

13:53:55&nbsp;
kristina
I, too, am worried about the flu shots. Please do LOTS of research from both sides of the fence.

13:53:57&nbsp;
Chris H
well you can only do so much - you can help her get better and that's a great thing

13:54:51&nbsp;
Chris H
try not to stress about it - stress is bad for you

13:55:36&nbsp;
kristina
Also, make sure your Vitamin D levels are where they need to be. Go to your medical doctor to get your vitamin D tested. If you need assistance in optimizing it, let me know.

13:55:50&nbsp;
michael b
a blog says people with so many shots with heavy metals is not good.

13:56:18&nbsp;
kristina
Vitamin D Deficiency Syndrome (VDDS) exists when 25(OH)D levels are less than 25 ng/m

13:56:27&nbsp;
Chris H
have you seen the studies on epigenome? and how stress and bad diet can effect the epigenome of your body and how that can cause health problems?

13:57:13&nbsp;
kristina
If you have any of these symptoms -- osteoporosis, heart disease, hypertension, autoimmune diseases, certain cancers, depression, chronic fatigue, or chronic pain -- you will need to bring your vitamin D levels even higher than what is normally recommended.

13:57:52&nbsp;
kristina
35�55 ng/mL is best. Higher is better

13:57:55&nbsp;
Mike
sorry, i left again.... work gets in the way - thanks kristina

13:58:31&nbsp;
kristina
You are welcome, Mike. Nice to be here with you today.

13:58:37&nbsp;
kristina
I hope you are feeling well. 

13:58:41&nbsp;
Mike
Kristina, will you be sending a reminder?

13:58:47&nbsp;
kristina
I hope the fires aren't being hard on anyone here.

13:58:50&nbsp;
Sarah S.
Do you have any doctors you can recommend?

13:59:01&nbsp;
kristina
yes, i will send a reminder the day before each live chat.

13:59:08&nbsp;
kristina
Where, Sarah?

13:59:32&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, Chris, I have actually.

13:59:36&nbsp;
Sarah S.
I'm in the NYC/Long Island area.

13:59:40&nbsp;
kristina
Bye all.

13:59:49&nbsp;
Mike
bye and thanks

13:59:54&nbsp;
kristina
Email or call us, Sarah.

14:00:06&nbsp;
Sarah S.
will do, thanks.
