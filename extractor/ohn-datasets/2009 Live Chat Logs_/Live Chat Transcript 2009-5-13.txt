Hi everyone!

kristina
Hi Dennis, I will start things up in a few minutes but feel free to post what is on your mind in the meantime.

19:58:49&nbsp;
dennis r
Does salt give us weight gain?

19:59:15&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Hi everyone!

19:59:32&nbsp;
kristina
Not a high quality sea salt like Celtic sea salt, http://www.optimalhealthnetwork.com/Healthy-Cooking-Aids-and-Supplements-p/0HHealthyDiet.htm

19:59:54&nbsp;
michael b
well, here's hoping everyone is well or getting there.

19:59:54&nbsp;
dennis r
I have a weight problem - thinking salt may be part of that

20:00:41&nbsp;
dennis r
I use low sodium salt in all foods

20:01:16&nbsp;
Dave
Hi all

20:01:19&nbsp;
ac
hi, I have an ileostomy (surgical error in 1997) with an intact colon. what is the best way to keep my colon is good healthy condition? any suggestions?

20:02:30&nbsp;
kristina
Commercial table salt used in our food is a problem. During the refining of table salt, natural sea salt or rock salt is stripped of more than 60 trace minerals and essential macro-nutrients. This salt is stripped of all its minerals (beside sodium and chloride) and heated at such high temperatures that the chemical structure of the salt changes. In addition, it is chemically cleaned and bleached and treated with anti-caking agents which prevent salt from mixing with water in the salt container. Unfortunately the anti-caking agents perform the same function in the human body, so refined salt does not dissolve and combine with the water and fluids present in our system. Instead it builds up in the body and leaves deposits in organs and tissue, causing severe health problems like fluid retention as well as hyperthyroidism. Two of the most common anti-caking agents used in the mass production of salt are sodium alumino-silicate and alumino-calcium silicate. These are both sources of aluminum, a toxic metal that has been implicated in the development of Alzheimer's disease. The aluminum used in salt production leaves a bitter taste, so manufactures usually add sugar in the form of dextrose to hide the taste of the aluminum. Refined sugar is associated with the development of more than 60 diseases.

20:03:20&nbsp;
kristina
Have you tried enemas? How many? How often?

20:03:35&nbsp;
Lisa P.
I don't know if this came up yet since I just logged in, but there was a report that in many restaurants, they put in way too much salt in the food and can be very harmful to some. On top of that, many people shake more salt in their food.

20:04:08&nbsp;
ac
no, I have not

20:05:18&nbsp;
michael b
lisa p, hope all is fine in austin, and the same for you Kristina, in madison.

20:05:50&nbsp;
Lisa P.
All is great Michael! Thanks for asking!

20:05:53&nbsp;
kristina
I personally use 1 teaspoon to 1 tablespoon of sea salt daily. It can help improve one's health and vitality tremendously.

20:06:34&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Is there a way to prevent getting the Swine flu?

20:06:47&nbsp;
Dave
I virtually never add salt to food. Why fight expensive anti-hypertension drugs?

20:07:08&nbsp;
dennis r
I have enemas at least every 2 days and use celtic salt 3 teaspoon for 3 qts

20:07:32&nbsp;
michael b
there has been a study on huge amounts of salt in fast food diners.

20:08:18&nbsp;
kristina
Can you let me know how your overall health is and how the health of your colon seems?

20:08:22&nbsp;
Lisa P.
The study was made in good restaurants.

20:08:42&nbsp;
kristina
Good question, Lisa.

20:09:29&nbsp;
ac
 I am  in very good health, I am 60 yrs old

20:09:44&nbsp;
dennis r
I'm in great shape! My blood pressure is 120/80, asthma at times

20:10:16&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Thanks Kristina. I'm concerned because I'll be taking another long plane trip in October to London, then Paris. Poor me! Lol! But I want to keep healthy!

20:10:31&nbsp;
dennis r
I'm 69 years old

20:10:41&nbsp;
michael b
no, places like that scottish place, you know McDonalds, and kfc.

20:11:02&nbsp;
Dave
Another timely topic - swine flu. best preventives, treatment?

20:11:03&nbsp;
kristina
To start with, I would try 1 enema series, see how it goes and then let me know so that I can further advise you. I have worked with folks in your situation and colon hydrotherapy works well for them. you won't &quot;get much out&quot; but the treatment is still therapeutic.

20:11:40&nbsp;
ac
I just believe this good healthy organ may be problematic as I age, so I am looking for suggestions to keep it in the best condition as possible

20:12:08&nbsp;
kristina
Stay away from factory farms. Don't promote the use of factory farms by eating meat or eggs produced on factory farms.

20:13:13&nbsp;
michael b
Lisa, are you able to get up and move around during the flights?

20:13:14&nbsp;
kristina
Know that it is very likely a big media scare campaign and not likely to hit hard.

20:13:40&nbsp;
ac
thank you, I will begin searching for a certified colon therapy program in my area and keep you posted...

20:13:45&nbsp;
kristina
Eat well, cleanse seasonally, all of which is laid out in my book, Ten Days to Optimal Health.

20:14:01&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Yes Michael, I try to get up as much as possible in the plane.

20:14:57&nbsp;
ac
you do suggest any herbal treatments to help keep an intact unused colon healthy?

20:15:28&nbsp;
kristina
Use herbs to build innate immunity like Echinacea and garlic.

20:16:07&nbsp;
ac
how do they get into your system - via the blood stream or are they absorbed in the colon?

20:16:34&nbsp;
michael b
so far, the news reports say the flu is not as strong as many other strains.

20:16:42&nbsp;
Matthew S.
Why do you use sea salt vs Krystal salt from under the Himalayan mountains from 250,000 years ago? It has the exact 84 elements found in the sea and human blood in a crystaline form that will dissolve to an ionic colloidal form (small enough to be absorbed)

20:16:55&nbsp;
kristina
Stay on top of your stress levels and optimize your adrenal and hormonal health using our Adrenal Stress Index Test, http://www.optimalhealthnetwork.com/Saliva-Hair-Stool-Metabolic-Type-Tests-Madison-WI-p/OHC_TESTS.htm, good sleep, adaptogenic herbs like Ashwaganda and Eleuthero

20:18:05&nbsp;
kristina
Great, AC. I look forward to that.

20:18:58&nbsp;
ac
 I so appreciate your advice...seems I cannot get any of this info from anyone in my traditional medical circles

20:20:11&nbsp;
kristina
I just received a report today from a gentleman in LA who worked through our Anal Fissure Healing program. He says, &quot;Kristina,   I just wanted to give you a status on my fissure.  After a month or so taking your supplemental vitamins and doing the enemas, I can honestly say I feel a whole lot better.  I stopped doing the enemas 4 days ago.  So far so good - my movements have been okay.  I am definitely a believer in your system.  My wife thought I was crazy for doing this but I told her I needed some relief of the pain.  The pain and I'm hoping the fissure is also gone.   I just have to keep watching my diet.&quot;

20:20:32&nbsp;
kristina
I am so honored to be a part of people's lives in this way so please do keep me posted.

20:21:25&nbsp;
kristina
Not often but more and more of us are learning, and we can all be a part of spreading the message of the many ways to truly take care of ourselves.

20:21:49&nbsp;
ac
thanks Kristina...I will keep you posted...have a good evening!

20:22:01&nbsp;
Tom A
Hello, All.... I'm a new chatter here, but wanted to sort of 'sign in'... 

20:22:08&nbsp;
kristina
 how do they get into your system, via the blood stream or are they absorbs in the colon

20:22:16&nbsp;
kristina
how does what get into the system, AC?

20:23:03&nbsp;
kristina
Welcome, Tom. We are glad to have you. Please tell us something about yourself. 

20:23:18&nbsp;
kristina
I see there are other new folks here that I would also enjoy hearing from.

20:23:45&nbsp;
kristina
Now that we have a bit of a pause, I want to advance the topic of the evening, which is What Can a Hair Analysis Tell Us?

20:23:48&nbsp;
Tom A
I've been associated with a colon therapist in the LA area, West Valley for many years.... 

20:24:24&nbsp;
ac
I certainly will keep you informed on my progress....you have given me a great start to keeping myself healthy for the next 60 yrs....thx!

20:24:24&nbsp;
kristina
As a client?

20:24:29&nbsp;
Matthew S.
 It does not have the toxins found in the sea and air when sea salt is dried. It is hand mined and hand washed, having the same  vibration in a brine as our blood                       

20:24:32&nbsp;
kristina
I am headed out to LA in a few weeks.

20:24:39&nbsp;
Dave
Fissures can re-open and colon care  is vital. My doc examines mine yearly to make sure.

20:24:47&nbsp;
Tom A
Have assisted using a Nellcor Oximeter to measure the oxygen content in the blood, to gauge if certain implants improved the levels.

20:24:55&nbsp;
kristina
Sounds like you are a fan, Matthew?

20:25:24&nbsp;
kristina
And, what are you finding?

20:25:33&nbsp;
ac
PS One more note...anyone have any colon therapists to suggest in the Washongton DC area?

20:25:57&nbsp;
kristina
An HTMA is an evaluation of overall health, of health trends, and of how one is managing lifestyle stressors.

20:26:15&nbsp;
kristina
HTMA can be an effective way to view the WHOLE body at a cellular level.

20:26:16&nbsp;
Matthew S.
yes, I believe it to be much better 

20:26:22&nbsp;
kristina
It is a screening test.

20:27:00&nbsp;
kristina
It is not meant to be diagnostic of a disease or condition but can be considered an overall evaluation of the current state of health.

20:27:02&nbsp;
Tom A
The company I did the 'research' for isn't any longer in business, but their products did seem to add 3 to 7 % O2 

20:27:19&nbsp;
kristina
I will look into it.

20:27:39&nbsp;
Tom A
I know that doesn't seem to be a lot, but if you're familiar with oxygen blood contents, you'll know that it it more than adequate.

20:28:03&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, indeed.

20:28:08&nbsp;
kristina
What were the implants?

20:28:15&nbsp;
Matthew S.
how do you treat Lyme disease with Candidiasis ?

20:28:23&nbsp;
Tom A
Every hear of OxyMoxy?

20:28:51&nbsp;
Tom A
(sounds flip, I know, but was for years a good sublingual enhancement.)

20:28:57&nbsp;
Matthew S.
no

20:29:19&nbsp;
kristina
A hair analysis can tell us about your metabolic rate, stage of stress, immune function, adrenal activity, thyroid activity, overall hormone imbalances, cardiovascular risk, digestive health, carbohydrate/sugar handling and protein intake and usage.

20:29:32&nbsp;
michael b
kristina, take some face masks, not just for smog, but it is forest and grass fire  season - i'm not kidding.

20:29:40&nbsp;
dennis r
Nice chatting, see you next month!

20:30:14&nbsp;
kristina
Back to the Swine Flu, a seasonal HTMA is valuable tool in tracking your own health to take charge of your own health.

20:30:56&nbsp;
kristina
Bye, Dennis. Thanks for joining us.

20:31:13&nbsp;
kristina
Thanks, Michael.

20:31:32&nbsp;

When we were there in November we ran into a few fires.

20:31:57&nbsp;
Matthew S.
I practice Bio-identical hormone therapy for 12 years

20:31:59&nbsp;
kristina
Do you mean how to treat a person with Lyme's and Candidiasis?

20:32:01&nbsp;
ac
thank you, K...talk with you next month

20:32:26&nbsp;
kristina
You are welcome. Please do keep in touch.

20:32:27&nbsp;
Matthew S.
yes

20:32:40&nbsp;
kristina
Well, that is a big project.

20:32:50&nbsp;
kristina
I always start with a therapeutic diet.

20:33:06&nbsp;
renaej
Hello Kristina,  I have a large tumor in my abdomen. It is about 30 centimeters.  It keeps my bowels from moving.  I am taking a laxative every other day.  Do you have any suggestions on what I can do until the surgery that i really don't want to have?

20:33:23&nbsp;
kristina
My basic dietary approach is laid out in my ten day diet, http://www.optimalhealthnetwork.com/10-Day-Detoxification-and-Cleansing-Diet-s/186.htm

20:33:30&nbsp;
ac
yes I will say in touch, I will be looking into the herbs and colon therapy program...BYE!

20:33:58&nbsp;
kristina
Eat often, drink lots of water, limit carbs, eat lots of high quality protein, high quality salt, healthy fats....

20:34:16&nbsp;
kristina
have you tried enemas?

20:34:33&nbsp;
renaej
no

20:34:38&nbsp;
Matthew S.
Warren Williams told me to talk to you about it. I have tried many different treatments. 

20:34:56&nbsp;
kristina
Now, has the person used antibiotics or not and how long do they believe they have had the Lyme's Disease?

20:35:25&nbsp;
kristina
Wanna give an enema series a try and see how that goes for you?

20:36:10&nbsp;
kristina
Here is some information on how to take an enema series...http://www.enemabag.com/how_to_take_an_enema.html

20:36:41&nbsp;
Dave
The best preventive for swine flu is to be in best health, including digestive/colon system. Enemas were given on first sign in some cases years ago.

20:37:11&nbsp;
michael b
you are welcome, I know some people living in the LA area who are amazed at how few birds there are living there. 

20:37:12&nbsp;
kristina
The answer to the above questions determines the next priorities as to how to treat the Lyme's and yeast overgrowth.

20:37:29&nbsp;
Matthew S.
The person is me, and I got the disease 12 years ago from blood transfusions from mva, only last 1-2 years have i been on antibiotics

20:37:49&nbsp;
kristina
What do you eat?

20:38:08&nbsp;
Tom A
When I was a boy, a long time ago, enemas were mom's FIRST resort! :)

20:38:17&nbsp;
kristina
How often do your bowels move?

20:38:26&nbsp;
kristina
What type of bowel movements do you have?

20:40:13&nbsp;
Matthew S.
I only use stevia, no sugar in anything, I drink Nikken water a lot, then the rest probably average diet

20:41:01&nbsp;
TaraM
Hi Kristina, I have a question regarding a &quot;walking itchy patch&quot;

20:41:02&nbsp;
kristina
Generally, in addition to the diet, you will need to load up your digestive tract with healthy organisms, use a gut healing protocol, load up on Echinacea root with a high alkylamide level to boost your innate immunity, improve the functioning of your liver and make sure the adrenal glands are at their best.

20:41:32&nbsp;
kristina
Welcome, Tara. Please do ask.

20:41:38&nbsp;
TaraM
This condition seems to occur in the women in the family

20:41:59&nbsp;
TaraM
I have an itchy patch that shows up on my wrist maybe a few times per year

20:42:06&nbsp;
TaraM
it alternates from one wrist to the other

20:42:19&nbsp;
TaraM
it happens to my mom's armpits

20:42:23&nbsp;
TaraM
and my sister's forearms

20:42:27&nbsp;
TaraM
same symptoms

20:42:29&nbsp;
TaraM
symptoms

20:42:37&nbsp;
TaraM
the doctors give us cream

20:42:43&nbsp;
TaraM
but we know it has to be systemic

20:42:52&nbsp;
TaraM
so I am wondering what might be causing it

20:43:02&nbsp;
TaraM
and is it a fungus, or viral, or what?

20:43:07&nbsp;
gjw
I have tried using the frankincense and myrrh goat milk soap in an enema for an enlarged prostate. I find that i can take only half a bag (1qt) approximately. I can hold that about 2-3 minutes before i have to go, I then repeat with the remaining half.

20:43:34&nbsp;
kristina
I would start by using an antifungal. I use Super Salve, http://www.optimalhealthnetwork.com/Super-Salve-and-Surgilube-Enema-Nozzle-Lubricants-p/0HLubricants.htm

20:43:47&nbsp;
kristina
So, I would think it is a fungus.

20:43:53&nbsp;
gjw
will this be effective in helping my prostate to shrink

20:43:57&nbsp;
Matthew S.
I take good probiotics but the last time I tested I had 3/4 abnl low values at ZRT. Main symptoms are daily chronic headaches and insomnia

20:44:07&nbsp;
kristina
This sounds good for an enema.

20:44:23&nbsp;
TaraM
oh ok, so fungal infections can live in your bloodstream?

20:44:33&nbsp;
kristina
I have reports from many that it improves prostate health.

20:45:03&nbsp;
gjw
how long  and how often should i take the treatments?

20:45:22&nbsp;
kristina
You might also take garlic for a while if you want to tackle this internally.

20:45:50&nbsp;
kristina
Garlic deserves some special attention here, with this newest discussion and our previous discussion of Swine Flu. 

20:45:57&nbsp;
kristina
It is the longevity herb, garlic.

20:46:01&nbsp;
Matthew S.
what kind/series of enemas?

20:46:15&nbsp;
kristina
And, it helps to prevent cardiovascular disease.

20:46:59&nbsp;
TaraM
so I wonder how me, my mom, and my sister all get the same fungus?

20:47:10&nbsp;
kristina
It is excellent against the common cold, flu, bronchial asthma, chronic bronchitis, chronic sinusitis and hay fever. It also removes heavy metals.

20:47:59&nbsp;
Dave
Agree, 3 minute hold after a quart hold is a good start.

20:48:19&nbsp;
kristina
I use it in the clinic with a few other herbs and essential oils with people to heal from candidiasis, to modify bowel flora and to remove intestinal worms. I also use it for peptic ulcers.

20:48:32&nbsp;
TaraM
oh ok

20:48:34&nbsp;
TaraM
cool

20:49:03&nbsp;
gjw
If I use the enema treatments form my prostate three times per week - say Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for example - is that too often? I don't want to become enema-dependent.

20:49:08&nbsp;
kristina
We only use the MediHerbs  garlic. You want to make sure your garlic is a high allicin releasing garlic.

20:49:43&nbsp;
kristina
The enemas in a row is the series that I recommend.

20:49:43&nbsp;
TaraM
so is this a specific condition?  any idea of how we would all get this same fungal condition?  I don't even live in the same state as they do.. lol

20:50:04&nbsp;
gjw
Once a week?

20:50:15&nbsp;
Lisa P.
TaraM, I have a funny thing to tell you, and it's 100% true! My Mom and I both got a hang nail about a week before we had our period! Can't figure that one out! Lol!

20:50:28&nbsp;
TaraM
lol

20:50:31&nbsp;
TaraM
that is funny

20:50:53&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Weird huh!

20:50:58&nbsp;
Matthew S.
which enemas - what's the order?

20:51:01&nbsp;
TaraM
yup

20:51:37&nbsp;
TaraM
so Kristina, how much of the garlic would have to be taken in order to get rid of the fungus, and how often and how long would it need to be taken for?

20:52:11&nbsp;
kristina
Most probiotics do their job by flowing through the digestive tract but don't end up making more &quot;parking spaces&quot; in order to improve the quality and quantity of healthy residents in the colon. That is where a gut protocol of garlic, oregano, pau d'arco, andrographis, and anise come in. 

20:52:40&nbsp;
kristina
You need to do this protocol a few days on and a few days off and repeat until we get the result you are looking for.

20:52:43&nbsp;
TaraM
oh ok, I take acidophilus with bifiduc already

20:52:50&nbsp;
TaraM
bifidus

20:53:16&nbsp;
kristina
You might think of this approach as the weed, feed, and seed approach.

20:53:30&nbsp;
Tom A
Great analogy

20:53:31&nbsp;
TaraM
interesting

20:53:48&nbsp;
TaraM
so in other words, cultivating the healthy bacteria in the colon

20:53:52&nbsp;
TaraM
or colonizing

20:53:56&nbsp;
kristina
How often to take an enema: http://www.enemabag.com/how_often_to_take_enemas.html

20:54:43&nbsp;
Tom A
Kristina... may I ask about something else?

20:54:48&nbsp;
kristina
For Lyme's Disease, we also use Cat's Claw and Rehmannia.

20:54:56&nbsp;
TaraM
Kristina, do you have any natural teeth whitening advice?

20:55:02&nbsp;
kristina
Please?

20:55:14&nbsp;
kristina
Natural, I haven't figured that one out yet.

20:55:28&nbsp;
TaraM
lol, oh ok

20:55:29&nbsp;
TaraM
thanks

20:55:32&nbsp;
kristina
Do you drink coffee or tea?

20:55:37&nbsp;
TaraM
no I sure don't

20:55:44&nbsp;
kristina
Baking soda works for some.

20:55:48&nbsp;
Tom A
Yes, there have been 'ads' on the web about a 'mom' who discovered a cheap whitening process.

20:55:57&nbsp;
Dave
Next chats?

20:56:03&nbsp;
kristina
go ahead, Tom.

20:56:03&nbsp;
TaraM
yeah they are just trying to sell you something

20:56:17&nbsp;
Tom A
I found that it's just  paste of hydrogen peroxide and baking soda.

20:56:23&nbsp;
TaraM
yes

20:56:28&nbsp;
kristina
The live chats are the 2nd and 4th Wednesdays of the month at 7pm and Noon respectively.

20:56:36&nbsp;
TaraM
that is what I was told was used in the olden days before toothpaste

20:56:42&nbsp;
TaraM
thanks Tom

20:56:46&nbsp;
michael b
Lisa, I have retired from working on mainline railroads. many engineers' backs have been all but destroyed, sitting in cheap seats and getting slammed around by heavy trains.

20:57:24&nbsp;
Tom A
and to remove surface stains, you can safely use diatomaceous earth, AKA swimming pool filter material.

20:57:56&nbsp;
TaraM
wow

20:57:56&nbsp;
Lisa P.
I'm glad these chats are going so well! I hope to be back next month. Have a great time in LA Kristina! I LOVE Ca. !!

20:58:06&nbsp;
kristina
So, the next chat is May 27th at 12 noon.

20:58:30&nbsp;
Tom A
It's the only ingredient in a commercial product called KEP... a bar above the e.

20:58:58&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Oops! typo. Have a great time in LA. !

20:59:04&nbsp;
TaraM
wow Tom you know a lot about that subject, you should sell your own teeth whitener lol

20:59:09&nbsp;
kristina
Thanks, Lisa.

20:59:15&nbsp;
Tom A
No it's really free!

20:59:22&nbsp;
TaraM
lol

20:59:34&nbsp;
kristina
Please do keep in touch folks. Thanks a lot for spending some time with me.
