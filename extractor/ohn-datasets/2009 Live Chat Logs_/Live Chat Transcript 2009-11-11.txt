Hi

19:58:58
kristina
Hello

20:00:48
kristina
As soon as you all are ready, please do start with your questions, comments, experiences, etc.

20:01:02
nanette d
Hi, I found you on uTube. Thanks for uploading your video there. How else could I have found you from California? I went, carefully, over the various products you make available through your website but I have no experience with using enemas.

20:01:20
kristina
I have a sick child home tonight so I might be a bit slow but I will do my best to delightedly keep up. I sure do appreciate folks showing up!

20:01:44
kristina
Good to finally meet you, Nanette.

20:02:01
kristina
Might you share your goals, your state of health, etc?

20:02:05
Dave
Hope it's not the dreaded flu. Best to all. 

20:02:35
kristina
The rest of the kids are eating roasted chicken, kale and onions and sweet potatoes.

20:03:21
Dave
Sounds quite healthy.

20:03:32
kristina
yes, indeed!

20:03:44
nanette d
I would like to buy myself the easiest, most convenient, most comfortable number of supplies so that I can do coffee enemas. I would also like to do the colonic irrigation type of enemas. When I telephoned your office today, I was too late to reach staff.

20:06:10
nanette d
My health: I went for an excellent 2-week fresh juice fast in early July. I've never done these type of things entirely on my own. I have gone for colonics. I make freshly squeezed vegetable juices, lighly steam my vegetables.

20:06:38
Brett H.
How is everybody?

20:06:59
Brett H.
I haven't been able to attend the chat for a long time.  Glad to be back.

20:07:17
kristina
Welcome, Brett

20:07:22
kristina
Okay, nanette....

20:07:53
kristina
enemas can have the same therapeutic effect as colon hydrotherapy, you just need to know what you are doing, take your time, and take multiple enemas.

20:08:26
kristina
Have you had a look at any of our Complete Colon Cleanse Coffee Enema kits?

20:08:31
nanette d
I'm getting better at adding vitamin and mineral supplements, which I ignored before. I am keen on doing the kidney, gall-bladder and liver flushes. But now I know coffee enemas are the best course of action. WHAT, which ones, do I buy?

20:09:30
Brett H.
enemas have certainly helped my skin, that's for sure

20:11:15
kristina
Those kits will get you started and meet your criteria

20:11:20
nanette d
There were 2 complete sets on sale when I looked 2 days ago but I could not tell what was included in the one and not in the other, and visa versa. Then there were all the different sizes, tubes, containers but, especially, whatever the &quot;pumps&quot; are used for.

20:11:30
Dave
This opens up the whole topic of seasonal and specialized (liver, kidney, etc.) cleansings.

20:14:18
kristina
There are 2 liter complete colon cleanse coffee enema bucket kits that have the same stainless steel enema bucket, the same 6 ft length of silicone hosing, the same simple-to-use white multi-position clamp, but different nozzles.

20:14:38
kristina
Do you have an idea of what type of nozzle you want to use? I recommend an assortment of nozzles.

20:15:12
kristina
Brett, can you tell us more? What skin troubles were you having? 

20:15:13
Brett H.
Why an assortment?  Isn't one good enough?

20:15:24
nanette d
I read one of the testimonials where the man said how much easier it was using the hand &quot;pump&quot; -- and looking at the ones on the website, I had no idea how those are used. I think I like the clear plastic bag, maybe the pail.

20:15:25
kristina
Yes, one nozzle is just fine.

20:15:54
Brett H.
Mainly acne.  I've had it for many years.

20:16:13
kristina
How did the enemas help?

20:16:21
kristina
How many enemas did you or do you take?

20:16:32
kristina
how often did you take enemas?

20:17:02
Brett H.
They helped to reduce it.  Even one showed results.

20:17:11
nanette d
Ah, the nozzles. To pick just one from across the country? Shoes, I know my size, but I would like to know I may have accidentally chosen exactly what I'd like to have.

20:17:17
kristina
The enema retention flexible inflatable nozzle is an excellent choice if you want to massage the belly while you are taking the enema.

20:17:41
Brett H.
At first, I took at least two or three a week.  Now less because of time.

20:18:00
kristina
However, during your first fill, the retention balloon might place too much pressure within the anus, causing cramping that would be better avoided during the first fill.

20:18:06
Brett H.
That's exactly the nozzle that I have and I do massage my belly.  :-)

20:18:39
kristina
Is the acne gone or how much has it improved with the use of the regular colon cleanse?

20:18:41
Brett H.
Thought of that, but I've been fine.  I've learned to deal with the brief initial cramping.

20:18:44
nanette d
Will I be able to speak with someone in your office so that I can make one order and that one should be complete? -- easiest and most comfortable to use and clean.

20:19:09
kristina
yes, let me look at tomorrow's schedule for you

20:19:41
Brett H.
It still likes to flare up, but enemas in combination with regular saunas and a decrease in my dairy intake have severely decreased it.

20:20:14
kristina
The office is very busy tomorrow. Best times to call our between 9:15 and 9:50 and between 3 and 4. All central time.

20:20:27
kristina
Excellent, Brett. 

20:20:34
kristina
What type of sauna? How often?

20:20:46
Brett H.
I occassonally get colonics too.  What's interesting, though, is that my acne likes to flare after those.  Interesting.

20:20:53
kristina
How did you figure out the dairy effect?

20:21:01
Brett H.
Steam sauna once a week.

20:21:17
kristina
Hmmmm...any ideas why the colon hydrotherapy increases the acne?

20:22:19
Brett H.
Research online.  Many people in forums I've read cut out or greatly decrease their dairy intake, and saw improvement in their skin.  I think it's the hormones in milk that's the culprit.

20:22:21
kristina
Does anyone use the seasonal cleanse like Dave brought up? Liver cleanse? Deep tissue cleanse?

20:22:38
kristina
Have you tried raw dairy?

20:22:41
nanette d
The original Finnish sauna is great. One of the body's 4 exits for its release of toxins so I used one for years but no longer have access to one. How do you find it compares with the infrared?

20:22:42
Brett H.
I'd like to try a seasonal cleanse.  What's all involved?

20:22:58
kristina
We have a FIR sauna. I also use a Bio Mat.

20:24:46
Brett H.
I've talked to the person that owns the place that I go to for saunas.  She's tried infrared, but doesn't like them because you don't sweat.  I find it's the sweating that really helps my skin, especially now as the cold sets in.

20:25:02
nanette d
Is the FIR the infrared and what is a Bio Mat? I used a natural bristle brush as well. I bought Mt.Capra's Goat Milk Whey -- to get away from the cow type.

20:25:24
Brett H.
I've haven't tried raw dairy.  I make my own soy milk, so it doesn't matter to me.

20:26:05
kristina
The BioMat is a pad which lies on top of a massage table or your home mattress. It converts electricity through a computerized control panel into Far Infrared Rays.

20:27:43
kristina
With the mat, you can sweat A LOT!

20:28:48
kristina
You lie on it and cover up and the sweat pours off. The FIR light waves are said to penetrate 6-8 inches into the body, stimulating healing and regeneration of nerves and muscle tissues but this wouldn't work for the acne.

20:28:52
nanette d
If I could email your office, list what I've seen on your website, then add my questions for each and request the recommended types. Also, some explanation for how the other supplies are to be used, that would be great. Is that possible?

20:29:01
Brett H.
How?  Does it convert the infrared to heat?  The person I know whose tried it feels like she's being cooked on the inside.

20:29:19
kristina
We have had excellent success with our FIR sauna and assisting people to rid themselves of psoriasis.

20:29:36
Brett H.
psoriasis?

20:29:39
kristina
I sleep on it nightly. I absolutely love it.

20:30:10
Brett H.
How does the infrared help with nerves?

20:30:39
kristina
Psoriasis is a skin condition that causes skin redness and irritation. 

20:31:18
kristina
People with psoriasis tend to have thick, red skin with scales that flake off.

20:32:27
Brett H.
Any tips of other stuff I should look to help improve or eliminate my acne?

20:32:59
nanette d
If one begins with coffee enemas, then when does one start the deeper type enemas or colonics?

20:33:23
kristina
the marketing for the biomat says that it emits negative ions and transforms positive ions to negative ions in the body.

20:34:29
kristina
Also, it increases blood flow, reduces swelling, and in many ways acts on the body as a fever would by destroying unwanted micro organisms like viral cells

20:34:52
kristina
You cleanse the colon before you take the coffee enema.

20:35:45
Brett H.
Doesn't increased body temperature also destroy good cells?  Isn't that the problem with fevers?

20:36:11
Brett H.
I've tried coffee, but without success.  My body absorbed it!

20:36:46
nanette d
Is the Bio Mat one thing -- or are there several brands? Do you sell the brand that you personally use?

20:36:51
Dave
Sorry for break, computer took over to install virus scan update

20:38:14
kristina
I would consider having a look at your hormonal levels. We do a male hormone panel.  From this information, we can help you optimize your testosterone, DHEA,  androstenedione, dihydrotestosterone, estrone and progesterone levels.

20:38:58
Brett H.
How do I do that?  Is it expensive?

20:39:00
kristina
We do offer the BioMat. It is a new product for us so it isn't currently available via the internet but when you call you can ask us about it.

20:39:06
kristina
It is one mat. 

20:39:17
Deb S
Hi 

20:39:19
kristina
The brand we recommend is from Richway.

20:39:24
kristina
Hi Deb

20:40:31
Deb S
Am I the only one on?

20:40:51
Brett H.
Nope.  Hi Deb!  :-)

20:40:59
Deb S
Hi Brett

20:41:43
kristina
I don't believe that fevers also kill &quot;good&quot; cells.

20:41:59
kristina
Nope, there are lots of us

20:42:15
Brett H.
Ok.  I thought I heard that a long time ago.

20:42:23
rick a
hi, my first time on, just following along

20:42:59
kristina
Welcome, Rick. It is great to have you here.

20:43:07
Deb S
If I am following protocol for enemas, why can't I hold them for more than 3 minutes?

20:43:21
kristina
Do you take enemas in series?

20:43:35
kristina
What enema solution do you use?

20:43:37
Deb S
Yes, first water/salt or oils then the coffee

20:44:01
kristina
Do you take one enema and then coffee or two and then coffee?

20:44:10
Deb S
one and then coffee

20:44:13
kristina
Do you have any inflammation in your colon that you are aware of?

20:44:30
Deb S
No, and what would that feel like?

20:44:39
kristina
Call the office and talk to DeeDee about the Male Hormone Panel.

20:45:47
kristina
pain, constipation, diarrhea, but not being able to hold an enema solution is sometimes an indication of colon inflammation.

20:46:09
kristina
So, you can't hold the first enema or the coffee enema for more than 3 minutes?

20:46:15
Deb S
what can I do to help that or is it something I am doing/eating?

20:46:32
Deb S
No neither one for more than 3 minutes

20:47:16
kristina
First suggestion that I have to improve the time that you can hold the coffee enema, because one doesn't really need to hold the cleansing enemas beyond filling the entire colon, is to add in a second cleansing enema before the third and final coffee enema

20:47:44
kristina
Could be something you are eating. Have a look at my ten day diet posted on my website.

20:48:01
Deb S
alright

20:48:17
Dave
Maybe also taking them too fast?

20:48:28
Brett H.
When is a good time to call?

20:48:35
Deb S
I am trying to get in for a colonic with you.

20:49:03
kristina
Also, we can look at your gut health and your gut immunity through our Adrenal Stress Index test.

20:49:25
Brett H.
Sorry to butt in, but how long do you take to give yourself an enema?  I usually give myself at least an hour.

20:49:30
kristina
If you call and we don't answer, we almost always call back the same day.

20:49:39
Deb S
Let's do that when I come in. I have already called and will discuss this in person then.

20:50:03
Deb S
you have been busy I'm sure. I'll wait.

20:50:04
kristina
Tomorrow the best times to call are between 9:15-9:30 and 3-4

20:50:13
Brett H.
Sorry, that question was for Deb.

20:50:27
Deb S
okay, good

20:50:51
Deb S
to brett, as long as it takes. I really pamper myself at this time.

20:50:54
Joseph
maybe start with a bulb to clean yourself out first, deb, then a trickle in 1.5 to 2 quart enema

20:51:02
kristina
And, the times was to Brett.

20:51:15
kristina
Deb, just let DeeDee know you want to work with me. I will make time for you.

20:51:23
Brett H.
Unfortunately, I'm at work during those times.  What about weekends?

20:51:34
Deb S
thanks and good night all!

20:51:36
kristina
You also might try taking your enemas in a hot bath.

20:51:49
Deb S
in the bath

20:51:55
nanette d
WHAT is the bulb? Just another thing -- maybe I mixed up a bulb with a pump? HOW and why are those used?

20:51:57
Brett H.
Wow!  The hour is almost gone already?

20:52:00
kristina
How about sending me an email, Brett, and I will send you all the details.

20:52:18
Brett H.
Ok.  That's a good idea.

20:52:25
kristina
Bulb syringe is a small container for filling only the rectal area.

20:52:46
Joseph
yes, about only 8 ounces of fluid

20:53:34
kristina
The smooth flow syringes are used as in line pumps to more effectively move water through the colon during a colon cleanse and are a part of the hosing system.

20:54:58
nanette d
Golly, I do hope I'll get some guidance rather than learning from my experience. I'd like to get by with no mistakes. 

20:55:24
kristina
There are many enema equipment choices but it all comes down to a container for the water, a delivery line, a clamp and a nozzle.

20:55:33
kristina
we will gladly help you.

20:56:07
kristina
There are two movies on You Tube but one of them has been tagged as sexual content so it is harder to see it. I'd like to figure out how to get it untagged but I haven't yet figured that out.

20:56:27
Brett H.
Email is sent.  It's sad that you guys are have so much trouble with spam.

20:56:36
nanette d
I really did look at everything and read each and every testimonial.

20:56:57
kristina
Also, have you had a look at our website, www.enemabag.com, as it has easy-to-follow enema equipment information.

20:57:23
Brett H.
What movies are you talking about?

20:57:35
nanette d
Can you send me an email to respond to? Or where do I find your email address or if you want I can put mine here.

20:58:01
Brett H.
Go to the contact page on www.optimalhealthnetwork.com

20:58:04
kristina
Nanette, if you want to send me your questions in an email, maybe I can write up a simple guide for first time users if I find your questions are well addressed

20:58:16
kristina
Coffee enema videos on youtube.

20:58:22
kristina
look up my name on youtube

20:58:36
Brett H.
Cool.  The same ones available on your website?

20:58:40
kristina
Good night all. Thanks so much for joining me tonight.

20:59:05
kristina
I will look forward to our next contact.

20:59:13
nanette d
I started with the youtube. perfect. I was convinced. Then your website served to confirm my confidence. Thank you.

20:59:17
Dave
Next chat?

20:59:27
kristina
you are very welcome.

20:59:31
Brett H.
Thanks for the help.  Hope I can attend next time.

21:00:09

4th Wed in November at noon, November 25th

21:00:25
Dave
Tnx.

21:01:03
Brett H.
Bummer.  Can't make it.  Oh well.  I look forward to your email, Kristina.  Good night all!  :-)

21:01:35
