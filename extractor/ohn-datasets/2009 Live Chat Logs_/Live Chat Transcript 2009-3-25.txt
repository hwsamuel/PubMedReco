hi

13:02:47&nbsp;
alanh
I have a question about depressed adrenal stress

13:03:05&nbsp;
kristina
Go ahead with your questions and comments

13:04:21&nbsp;
kristina
I am glad that you are here because it is just the adrenal glands that I wanted to talk about today.

13:04:40&nbsp;
kim g
can we ask questions about other subjects also?

13:04:41&nbsp;
kristina
First of all, when we think about the adrenal glands, we need to keep the entire endocrine system in mind:

13:05:22&nbsp;
alanh
I was diagnosed with depressed adrenal stress an am taking Eleuthro, Licorice and Min-chex. My diet is a healthy one but are there any particular foods, etc, that may help this problem?

13:05:34&nbsp;
kristina
The pituitary, the pineal, the thyroid, the parathyroids, the thymus, the pancreas, the adrenals, and the ovaries and the testes are all key in optimizing adrenal health.

13:05:48&nbsp;
kristina
Absolutely ask whatever is on your mind.

13:05:53&nbsp;
kristin j
my question is about using your colonic board and not getting anything out.

13:06:06&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, Alan.

13:06:18&nbsp;
kristina
Can you give me a rough draft of what you currently eat?

13:06:56&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Hi everyone! Pretty rare I can make it at this time!

13:08:05&nbsp;
kristina
when working on a protocol to heal the adrenal glands, we need to eat often, as often as every two hours. Small meals are best. 

13:09:05&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Hi Mike K! I'm doing well. I'm getting ready to go to Carmel Ca next week!!

13:09:29&nbsp;
kim g
kristina, i was told not to do enemas (healing from severe eczema) due to the fact that it strips your body of good bacteria. I do a probiotic implant but is that enough?

13:09:35&nbsp;
kristina
Just a bit of a side note here, before the chat started I was on the phone with my friend Mike who is working for the Nurse's Union in Washington D.C on the Employee Free Choice Act

13:09:54&nbsp;
kristina
Just as we were hanging up so that I could type, President Obama drove by. That was fun.

13:09:59&nbsp;
alanh
yes. Fresh steak and raw salad for breakfast. This salad has broccoli, carrots, avocadas, tomatoes and kale. Usually an apple for dessert. I try to eat every three hours if possible. Lunch contains a smaller portion of protein and some type of salad. 

13:10:20&nbsp;
kristina
How often do your bowels move, Kim?

13:10:32&nbsp;
kim g
well, not sure now since i have been fasting

13:10:40&nbsp;
kristina
Also, if I don't address one of your posts, do post again as sometimes I do lose a thread.

13:10:42&nbsp;
kim g
but probably 1-2 times per day

13:11:14&nbsp;
alanh
My dinner is much like lunch. I use 3 tablespoons of olive oil and a tablespoon of coconut oil each day

13:11:15&nbsp;
kim g
hard to say since i have been doing enemas reguarly

13:11:32&nbsp;
kristina
Kim, what is your goal in doing enemas? What is your history with colon cleansing?

13:12:05&nbsp;
watsum
Hi - Is it a good idea to mix a coffee enema with some Bifidonate - ? 

13:12:05&nbsp;
kim g
well, i am trying to detox so i am fasting and was warned by many other people to do enemas while fasting so as to not reabsorb toxins

13:12:43&nbsp;
kristina
Protein is also key for healing the adrenals. High quality protein sources - organic, grass fed, raw - need to be eaten throughout the day. Always eat some protein and fat with a carbohydrate. Never eat a carbohydrate only meal.

13:13:08&nbsp;
kristina
Great on the fats, Alan. Do you use raw dairy products?

13:13:10&nbsp;
Sandi B
How often is it safe to take enemas?

13:13:58&nbsp;
alanh
I am unable to get these products locally. The nearest place is 150 miles away

13:13:59&nbsp;
kim g
not sure if i should just take some psyllium powder to move my bowels while fasting

13:14:04&nbsp;
kristina
Enemas do not tend to strip the body of good bacteria.

13:14:33&nbsp;
Sandi B
Who here takes enemas?

13:14:38&nbsp;
kristina
No, I wouldn't use the coffee and the bifidonate together.

13:14:41&nbsp;
kim g
is all raw as effective as fasting

13:14:47&nbsp;
kristina
Use the coffee and then use the bifidonate.

13:15:24&nbsp;
Mike K
Sandi B  I Do

13:15:30&nbsp;
kim g
me too

13:15:37&nbsp;
kristin j
My question was, that with the colonic board I purchased from you, i have not been able to get enough water in me to get enough stuff out.  thanks

13:15:46&nbsp;
kristina
For some, it is safe to take daily enemas and for others it is not. Can you tell me more about your individual situation?

13:15:50&nbsp;
kristina
Also, you can go to http://www.enemabag.com/how_often_to_take_enemas.html

13:16:07&nbsp;
kristina
to learn more about how often it is safe to take enemas.

13:16:18&nbsp;
kristina
That is far, Alan.

13:16:23&nbsp;
alanh
Another problem I am trying to solve is that I stopped chewing tobacco, after 40 years, about a month ago. I now feel extremely tired all the time. Is there a solution?

13:16:31&nbsp;
Sandi B
do you take enemas, Kristina?

13:16:42&nbsp;
kristina
Alan, have you tried daily coffee enemas?

13:17:01&nbsp;
watsum
Thanks Kristina - Can the Bifidonate be mixed with plain water and about how often should Bifidonate be used - ? - ? 

13:17:11&nbsp;
kristina
I wrote in my last chat how the coffee enemas work to carry out the toxins from tobacco usage.

13:17:45&nbsp;
Lisa P.
I think on a forum like this, we all here do enemas to improve our health.

13:17:48&nbsp;
kristina
You can access those chat logs here.

13:17:52&nbsp;
alanh
Yes, this seems to help some, but I am still staying tired. I took a series this morning and I feel like I need a nap now

13:17:59&nbsp;
kim g
how fast should someone see results with one daily coffee enema they did not seem to help me but maybe i did not do them for a long enough period

13:18:59&nbsp;
Katy
Hello and Happy Birthday Kris

13:19:30&nbsp;
kristina
Kristin, with a colon board, you still need to take water into the colon slowly so that the colon can hold 2-4 quarts of water before you allow a release. Also, if the colon isn't emptying out with just a water solution, try peppermint essential oil.

13:19:48&nbsp;
kristina
and sea salt

13:20:21&nbsp;
kristina
Alan, what are you eating for the rest of the day? I believe we left off at lunch?

13:21:06&nbsp;
kristin j
thank you.  do i hold it all that water?  and for how long?

13:22:30&nbsp;
michael b
hello, and a wonderful spring to all you fellow chatters 

13:22:31&nbsp;
kristina
I started using the colon cleanse about 12 years ago. Over these years, I have taken many, many enemas. Currently, I take enemas when I feel that I need them but for now I am not on a daily or weekly schedule as I have been in other years.

13:22:49&nbsp;
kristina
Can you nap, Alan?

13:23:04&nbsp;
alanh
Lunch is some type of meat and a raw salad. Dinner is usually a few pieces of cheese and a salad. Dinner usually is small because I'm not hungry

13:23:14&nbsp;
kristina
Napping, as time consuming as it can be, is one of the most therapeutic things we can do.

13:23:21&nbsp;
kristin j
2nd additional question:  do you like enemas better than the colonic board?

13:24:01&nbsp;
kristina
However, if you feel that the enema is more irritating then I would want to see a hair analysis to assist you.

13:24:10&nbsp;
kristina
more information on hair analysis

13:24:13&nbsp;
alanh
Yes I'm retired and I have no trouble napping. I can do my projects at any time

13:24:13&nbsp;
Sandi B
Kim and Mike, how often do you take enemas?

13:24:45&nbsp;
kim g
i have been taking one daily

13:24:56&nbsp;
kim g
not sure how big the bag is but i do 2 bagfuls

13:25:09&nbsp;
Mike K
Sandi B - as often as I feel I need to, which is sometimes daily

13:25:11&nbsp;
kristina
Once you have the 2-4 quarts of colon cleanse solution in  your colon, you don't so much need to hold the solution

13:25:23&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, I do prefer enemas to the colon board.

13:25:45&nbsp;
kim g
i can't seem to get the whole bag in at once

13:25:47&nbsp;
kristin j
Oh my.  Now I must ask you why, please.

13:25:49&nbsp;
kim g
i am kind of tiny

13:25:57&nbsp;
Sandi B
kim - what type bag do you use?

13:26:25&nbsp;
kristina
are folks okay with questions from other members, if not, just let them know

13:26:50&nbsp;
michael b
Kristina, thanks for the tip on worst pills / best pills book.

13:27:06&nbsp;
kristina
you are welcome. have you had a look at it?

13:27:21&nbsp;
kim g
sandy b - 1.5 quarts i think

13:27:36&nbsp;
kristina
Great, Alan.

13:27:49&nbsp;
kim g
how fast should someone see results with one daily coffee enema? they did not seem to help me but maybe i did not do them for a long enough period

13:27:56&nbsp;
kristina
My mom, who had the stroke in February and who also hasn't smoked since February, needs to sleep lots.

13:28:18&nbsp;
kristina
I don't think she needs all that sleep just to help her with the recovery from her stroke. 

13:28:27&nbsp;
kim g
good for her for stopping the cigarettes

13:28:51&nbsp;
kristina
It is very hard work for the body to clear out the effects of long-time tobacco usage.

13:28:58&nbsp;
kim g
i am sure

13:29:08&nbsp;
kristina
I am indeed proud of you for taking that excellent step to optimize your health.

13:29:10&nbsp;
Lisa P.
I'm so glad your Mom stopped smoking!!! I should think rest is good for her.

13:29:20&nbsp;
kristina
I believe I have lost a thread or two......???

13:29:32&nbsp;
kim g
how fast should someone see results with one daily coffee enema? they did not seem to help me but maybe i did not do them for a long enough period

13:29:39&nbsp;
kristin j
please tell me why you prefer enemas over the board. 

13:29:46&nbsp;
kristina
Kim, what results are you looking for?

13:29:54&nbsp;
kim g
i have severe eczema

13:30:03&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, it is a HUGE deal that she gave up smoking.

13:30:06&nbsp;
kim g
i am eating almost perfectly and have been for sooooo long!!!

13:30:09&nbsp;
michael b
never heard of it till today, i'm off to my independent book store to order it.

13:30:11&nbsp;
kim g
it is crazy

13:30:25&nbsp;
kristina
Do you use a sauna, especially an FIR sauna, Kim?

13:30:29&nbsp;
kim g
no

13:30:36&nbsp;
kim g
no sauna

13:30:44&nbsp;
Sandi B
Kim - what position do you use for your enemas?

13:31:11&nbsp;
kim g
i just lie down on the floor on my back recently i find i can hold more on my left side 

13:31:13&nbsp;
kristina
We have had numerous people use our FIR sauna for eczema, with profound results.

13:31:34&nbsp;
kim g
also today for the first time i massaged my stomach counterclockwise- seemed to help some

13:31:36&nbsp;
alanh
I used the chewing tobacco to substitute for food and energy. I could go for days without eating or sleeping. This was especially useful on my job where I worked 80 + hours a week. 

13:31:38&nbsp;
Katy
Kris, what kind of health issues might a person whose mother smoked during pregnanacy expect?

13:31:50&nbsp;
kim g
was hoping the coffee enema would help me heal

13:31:55&nbsp;
kristina
I also have information on herb and drug interactions for those who are interested.

13:31:57&nbsp;
kim g
but it hasn't 

13:32:18&nbsp;
kim g
that is why i was wondering if i didn't do it long enough

13:32:20&nbsp;
Sandi B
kim - do you use only coffee enemas?

13:32:32&nbsp;
kim g
only did one coffee enema per day for about a week 

13:32:53&nbsp;
Sandi B
kim, what else have you used?

13:32:55&nbsp;
kristin j
please tell me why you prefer the enema over the board. wish i had known that before i bought the board from you!

13:33:09&nbsp;
kristina
For instance, for those of you who are using any kind of fiber product and taking any supplements or pharmaceuticals, you want to take the fiber product at least two hours before or after your pills. 

13:33:20&nbsp;
kim g
sandi b - no actually right now just using water enemas

13:33:22&nbsp;
kristina
this is tricky, especially for those of us who are eating every couple of hours.

13:33:42&nbsp;
kim g
i am fasting right now and want to make sure i don't reabsorb the toxins

13:33:47&nbsp;
Sandi B
kim - plain water?

13:33:55&nbsp;
kim g
yes distilled water

13:34:22&nbsp;
kim g
i am very miserable - look and feel like a burn victim

13:34:26&nbsp;
Sandi B
kim - what equipment do you use?

13:34:34&nbsp;
kim g
i have a 1.5 quart bag

13:34:43&nbsp;
kim g
at least i think that is the one i have

13:35:02&nbsp;
Sandi B
kim - where did you buy it?

13:35:12&nbsp;
kim g
optimal health network

13:35:17&nbsp;
kim g
of course :-)

13:35:30&nbsp;
kim g
it is red

13:35:35&nbsp;
kristina
For those of us whose mothers smoked while we were in utero, we can expect to need to put extra resource into supporting our minds, our nerve health and our digestive health.

13:35:38&nbsp;
kim g
i bought a clear one but the end is too big 

13:35:50&nbsp;
kim g
so i was going to buy another end to go on it so i can use that bag

13:36:19&nbsp;
Katy
that is true for me Kris

13:36:21&nbsp;
kim g
kris - how long do you recommend doing daily coffee enemas before you get results?

13:36:33&nbsp;
Sandi B
kim - do you use vaseline?

13:36:38&nbsp;
kim g
no

13:36:52&nbsp;
kim g
i use KY - prob not the best but it sure helps

13:37:12&nbsp;
kristin j
please tell me why you prefer the enema to the board, kristina.

13:37:14&nbsp;
Sandi B
ok

13:37:18&nbsp;
kristina
thank you

13:37:20&nbsp;
michael b
kim, you should be adding celtic salt to all of your enema solutions

13:37:21&nbsp;
kim g
i know gerson used coffee enemas for his cancer protocol so i know they are good to do 

13:37:31&nbsp;
kim g
is just natural sea salt okay

13:37:42&nbsp;
kristina
Why I prefer the enema to the board....

13:37:56&nbsp;
kim g
michael - what does the celtic sea salt do exactly?

13:37:58&nbsp;
kristina
I don't think the enema is for everyone. I do think that the colon board works wonders for some people.

13:38:35&nbsp;
kristina
With the enemas, it is easier to take in the 2-4 quarts of water into the colon at one time.

13:38:42&nbsp;
kim g
is natural sea salt okay or do you have to use celtic sea salt?

13:38:46&nbsp;
kristina
You can lie anywhere you want with the enemas.

13:38:49&nbsp;
kim g
and why sea salt?

13:39:14&nbsp;
kristina
You can use a retention nozzle with the enemas.

13:39:23&nbsp;
kristina
You can use an inline pump with the enemas

13:39:29&nbsp;
Mike K
kim g because it has natural minerals that the body needs

13:39:36&nbsp;
kim g
okay

13:39:39&nbsp;
kristina
The enema equipment is easy to store.

13:39:44&nbsp;
kim g
is natural sea salt okay mike k?

13:40:00&nbsp;
Mike K
kim g yes

13:40:03&nbsp;
kim g
and how much

13:40:11&nbsp;
kristina
But, you have access to more water with the colon board. If you use the colon board as if you are taking an enema series, I believe they work better. Meaning that you take in

13:40:22&nbsp;
Mike K
kim g - IE is 1 tsp. per quart

13:40:24&nbsp;
kristina
the 2-4 quarts of water before you begin to release any water

13:40:37&nbsp;
kim g
okay thanks mike k!

13:40:39&nbsp;
kristina
Most sea salts are fine.

13:40:49&nbsp;
kristin j
thank you!  

13:40:51&nbsp;
kim g
sound good!

13:41:18&nbsp;
kim g
sorry don't mean to sound like a broken record, kris, but how long should i do coffee enemas?

13:41:32&nbsp;
kristina
Distilled water can be an excellent therapeutic choice for both drinking and enemas, for a short period of time only.

13:41:35&nbsp;
kim g
i before i can see results

13:41:46&nbsp;
Katy
are there any sea salts that are not good?

13:42:01&nbsp;
kristina
Do you mean how long do you hold the coffee enema or how many times do you take a coffee enema?

13:42:06&nbsp;
Katy
Like the very white ones that may be precessed

13:42:21&nbsp;
kim g
no, i did daily coffee enemas for a week with no results

13:42:23&nbsp;
kristina
And, if I haven't answered a questions it is because I missed it so ask and ask again, always.

13:42:34&nbsp;
kim g
is that enough time to see if it will help

13:42:47&nbsp;
kim g
i have heard good things about them but they did not help me

13:42:55&nbsp;
michael b
kim, it helps balance PH, and deal with water depletion. 

13:42:56&nbsp;
kim g
but i only did one per day for a week

13:43:01&nbsp;
Katy
:D 

13:43:13&nbsp;
kim g
okay thanks michael b.

13:43:42&nbsp;
kristina
very good question....that would be an excellent research project that I would love to see the results of...one issue is how much sodium chloride is in the salt

13:44:37&nbsp;
Katy
are low quality sea salts mostly sodium chloride?

13:44:42&nbsp;
kim g
my sea salt has 98.32% sodium chloride

13:45:04&nbsp;
kristina
Adulterated commercial mass market salt is very poor quality and is actually a poison. This is because it has been refined in a kiln at extremely high temperatures in order to harvest the salt's minerals for industry. What is left over is a purified chemical known as sodium chloride which was never intended to be used for human consumption. Many additional chemicals such as anti-caking agents, flowing agents and dextrose are added to the sodium chloride and this concoction known as &quot;salt&quot; can indeed create health problems, especially high blood pressure.

13:45:25&nbsp;
kim g
it says it contains 50+ trace minerals, including iodine

13:45:58&nbsp;
Katy
what brand Kim??

13:46:08&nbsp;
kim g
redmond real salt

13:46:10&nbsp;
kristina
Here is another excerpt about sea salt: all sea salts, even if from the most pristine waters, contain various organic materials such as dead fish, fish waste etc. Muramoto maintained that this dead biological matter and waste products are very toxic for the human body. In order to avoid this concentration of foul organic material sensei resurrected an ingenious ancient Japanese method for cleaning sea salt to remove these impurities. No other sea salt on the market has been cleaned in this manner. All the sea salts available for sale are sun dried and then ground. Many have a gray tint that signifies the presence of limestone. Try boiling your sea salt and notice the scum that has accumulated on top which comes from the decayed fish and other sea animals. The salt bed where our sea salt is harvested is an amazing ancient volcanic crater located on the deserted coast of Baja, California. This crater is approximately 6 feet below sea level and is located about 50 yards from the Pacific Ocean behind a mountain. Because the sea water filters through the volcanic crater, the resulting salt contains rare source trace minerals such as cobalt which is essential for the synthesis of vitamin B 12. 

13:46:12&nbsp;
kim g
all natural sea salt

13:46:51&nbsp;
kristina
No, not for eczema, a week of coffee enemas most likely won't give the results you are looking for.

13:49:12&nbsp;
kristina
Celtic Sea Salt&reg; Brand - The Original Brand - is authentic, unprocessed whole salt from one of the most pristine coastal regions of France. Since 1976, Celtic Sea Salt&reg; Brand has been harvested by the paludiers (salt farmers) of Brittany using a farming method that preserves the purity and balance of ocean minerals.  Celtic Sea Salt&reg; Brand is doctor recommended

13:49:26&nbsp;
kristina
You also need to look out for heavy metals in sea salt

13:49:44&nbsp;
paul
Hi, I had a question about coffee enemas?

13:49:47&nbsp;
kristina
Celtic sea salt: In our most recent analysis all these elements were either nondetectable (Arsenic, Cadmium, Mercury) or were well under the published safe limits specified by Codex (Lead – present at levels no higher than .000076% while the Codex limit is .000200%). There are no limits specified for Nickel (present at levels no higher than .000004%).

13:49:52&nbsp;
kristina
ask away

13:50:12&nbsp;
paul
How does it affect good gut bacteria?

13:50:43&nbsp;
michael b
and it is great for cooking, tastes better too

13:51:13&nbsp;
Katy
Does salt kill some good bacteria in the colon?

13:51:29&nbsp;
Katy
even good sea salt?

13:51:40&nbsp;
kristina
First of all, I don't think that anyone really knows exactly how putting coffee into the colon effects the bacteria in the colon.

13:52:04&nbsp;
kristina
This is true of salt, too.

13:52:21&nbsp;
paul
So, is it a good idea to do post probiotic implants?

13:53:31&nbsp;
kristina
For what it is worth, The Nestle Research Center recently conducted a study on coffee’s role in gut health. Researchers found instant coffee consumed in moderation may increase Bifidobacterium spp. in the gut.

13:54:12&nbsp;
kim g
is 98.32% sodium chloride okay to use?

13:54:12&nbsp;
kristina
Consuming three cups of instant coffee a day for three weeks resulted in increased populations of Bifidobacterium, a healthy “probiotic” bacteria. The researchers stated that it is not currently known which of the components of coffee could be responsible for the effect, but they noted that both fiber and chlorogenic acids may be metabolized by the gut microbiota.

13:54:26&nbsp;
kim g
i mean is that particular salt okay to use

13:54:41&nbsp;
paul
The reason I ask is because I have been doing  alot  of FIR sauna and sometimes follow up with the coffee, as it it really helps as Sherry Rogers suggested in her books

13:54:45&nbsp;
Katy
Hum, I wish it were chocolate that increase Bifodo. :D :D 

13:55:16&nbsp;
kristina
Kim, I am not certain. Will you email the question and I will research it for you.

13:55:24&nbsp;
kim g
sure

13:55:26&nbsp;
kim g
thanks

13:55:33&nbsp;
kristina
you are welcome.

13:55:41&nbsp;
kim g
so three cups of coffee in an enema or by mouth

13:55:55&nbsp;
kim g
it increases the good bacteria

13:56:38&nbsp;
paul
What about sweet dairy whey?

13:56:40&nbsp;
kristina
It is a VERY good idea to do the probiotic implants. Always use just bifidus or a formula rich in bifidus.

13:56:50&nbsp;
kristina
