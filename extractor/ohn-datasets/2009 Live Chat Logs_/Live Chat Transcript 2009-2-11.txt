Hello folks. I will post a topic or two soon. In the meantime, I am very pleased you are all here and let me know what you want to talk about.

20:01:05&nbsp;
KelleyK
I have chronic constipation due to my antidepressant

20:01:27&nbsp;
KelleyK
and am wondering if it is safe to take daily large volume enemas

20:01:28&nbsp;
Gary W
last week i suddenly got a horrible stomach ache

20:01:38&nbsp;
Gary W
and i felt horribly bloated

20:01:43&nbsp;
Dave
Hi all

20:01:48&nbsp;
Gary W
hi dave

20:02:03&nbsp;
Gary W
hi kelley

20:02:09&nbsp;
Gary W
hi kristina

20:02:12&nbsp;
kristina
Kelley, it is likely very safe to take a daily large volume enema. I do write about safety issues on www.enemabag.com, which is an excellent place for you to explore.

20:02:19&nbsp;
KelleyK
to retrain my colon.  I recently bought the 4-qt. flowmaster black kit

20:02:30&nbsp;
KelleyK
I have read your entire site, I think Kristina and found it all very helpful

20:02:41&nbsp;
Gary W
so we can handle 4 quarts?

20:02:54&nbsp;
KelleyK
I just don't want to become dependent

20:02:59&nbsp;
Gary W
hi lisa

20:03:08&nbsp;
KelleyK
Gary, yes I was able to.  I am a 36 year old healthy female

20:03:17&nbsp;
kristina
It would be best to monitor your electrolyte levels using the Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis, if you are going to take daily enemas for an extended period of time. 

20:03:33&nbsp;
KelleyK
Kris, I just honestly can't spend any more money at this point.

20:03:38&nbsp;
Gary W
how many do you need to do until your colon really starts to clean out?

20:03:38&nbsp;
kristina
Hi Lisa. Hi Dave

20:03:43&nbsp;
skykingh
skykingh This is my first time on this chat

20:03:51&nbsp;
Lisa P
Kristina, I hope your Mom is doing well!

20:04:07&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, most people, if they take the enema solution into the colon slowly, can handle 4 quarts.

20:04:12&nbsp;
KelleyK
I had 10 colonics by a pro but that didn't fix my constipation.  As soon as they were over, I was constipated again....

20:04:16&nbsp;
Gary W
can we take that test at home and send it in for analysis?

20:04:40&nbsp;
skykingh
I visited your facility in July and my health has been really changed around

20:04:44&nbsp;
kristina
However, some people don't need to take the full 4 quarts in order to clear out the entire colon, which is the goal of the 4 quart enema.

20:04:49&nbsp;
KelleyK
Gary, you can do it if you watch Kristina's video

20:04:56&nbsp;
Gary W
ok

20:05:02&nbsp;
KelleyK
It tells you exactly how.

20:05:05&nbsp;
Gary W
ok

20:05:14&nbsp;
KelleyK
Plus her website directions are available too

20:05:27&nbsp;
kristina
In the 9 years that I have been working in the colon cleanse field, I have not met anyone who has become dependent on enemas.

20:05:37&nbsp;
Gary W
should a person use the long tube that goes in approx 4 feet?

20:05:40&nbsp;
KelleyK
But don't expect the drugstore to have enema bags...I had to buy one at Kristina's site

20:06:03&nbsp;
Gary W
i'd never buy one anywhere else

20:06:04&nbsp;
KelleyK
Thank you Kristina, I see we are several people all over the place right now trying to get advice!

20:06:15&nbsp;
Gary W
i want to know the bag is safe

20:06:16&nbsp;
KelleyK
Gary, :)

20:06:36&nbsp;
kristina
The dependency myth was started and is propagated by the pharmaceutical industry which wants us to use drugs and not the simple, cost effective and safe enema. 

20:06:36&nbsp;
Gary W
yes kelleyk?

20:06:46&nbsp;
Gary W
amen

20:07:00&nbsp;
KelleyK
Kris, is it normal that doing daily enemas means now I have almost no hard stool coming out, just discolored water and some candida?

20:07:05&nbsp;
Gary W
i don't ever want to take drugs if i can help it

20:07:05&nbsp;
kristina
I understand about the money thing. Just make sure that you feel better after the enemas and not drained or sick. 

20:07:38&nbsp;
kristina
If you start feeling drained or sick after enemas, then we will need to shift something. Also, use sea salt in your food and in your enemas.

20:07:38&nbsp;
KelleyK
I have noticed that I am getting a low-grade headache daily since starting daily enemas, but that's it...is that normal maybe from toxins being released?

20:07:54&nbsp;
Gary W
since i got sick last week i feel like my colon is plugged

20:07:59&nbsp;
kristina
I may lose questions or comments as we go along so do post again

20:08:00&nbsp;
KelleyK
I am using sea salt in my enemas, 1 tsp. per quart

20:08:08&nbsp;
Gary W
did something break loose?

20:08:33&nbsp;
Gary W
and i feel nauseous all the time

20:08:38&nbsp;
KelleyK
I'm also drinking more water and taking probiotics, digestive enzymes, etc.

20:09:03&nbsp;
KelleyK
Gary, you sound blocked up...I know, I've been there a lot!

20:09:04&nbsp;
Gary W
i feel like my body is full of poisons - even my eyes hurt

20:09:14&nbsp;
kristina
Gary, it depends on your history. Some people just need one good enema to clean themselves out as long as the colon seems to be emptying daily on its own. 

20:09:33&nbsp;
Gary W
i used to go with no problem everyday

20:09:58&nbsp;
kristina
If it doesn't seem to be emptying fully on its own, a series once a day for one week to three months has been recommended followed up by an enema series once a week or so.

20:10:05&nbsp;
Gary W
the last 4 days even with cascara sagrada i have troubles

20:10:11&nbsp;
KelleyK
I can't get the copy &amp; paste to work darnit!

20:10:14&nbsp;
Dave
Gary, had a consult with a doc, or colonoscopy, etc?

20:10:26&nbsp;
kristina
Long tube that is four feet?

20:10:27&nbsp;
Gary W
no... not yet

20:10:32&nbsp;
kristina
Not necessarily.

20:10:41&nbsp;
KelleyK
I will wait until Gary is done...

20:10:59&nbsp;
Gary W
i want to go on vacation and not feel horrible

20:11:05&nbsp;
skykingh
I have nerve damage in my feet and coffee enemas several times a week really seems to work. Can I safely continue using them for the long term? This pain seems to be worse in the winter

20:11:06&nbsp;
kristina
I have missed some of the posts as the page cuts off after so many posts. I like all the activity though.

20:11:21&nbsp;
Gary W
good

20:11:34&nbsp;
Gary W
i think what you are doing is great kristina

20:11:49&nbsp;
kristina
Well, you can go on vacation and not feel horrible. Where do we start?

20:11:55&nbsp;
kristina
Before this last week, how was your health?

20:11:56&nbsp;
Gary W
i am so thankful you have fought the system

20:12:12&nbsp;
Gary W
what should i do kristina?

20:12:15&nbsp;
KelleyK
Gary, please give others a chance to get help from kristina too

20:12:30&nbsp;
Gary W
it was pretty good, but i have been a little overweight

20:12:36&nbsp;
Gary W
i eat healthy

20:12:41&nbsp;
Gary W
and i walk

20:12:49&nbsp;
kristina
It sounds like the protocol you are using works well for your body, skykingh, yes?

20:12:52&nbsp;
Gary W
but i do snack on junk food to

20:13:21&nbsp;
Gary W
and i am convinced i have lots of junk in my colon

20:13:31&nbsp;
kristina
Gary, do you have the flu or some virus?

20:13:49&nbsp;
Gary W
that's what i originally thought it was last week

20:13:50&nbsp;
skykingh
It seems to work great. I have tried simple pain medicine but it does not work long

20:13:54&nbsp;
kristina
Please go ahead, Kelley, 

20:14:06&nbsp;
kristina
and the enemas work better than the pain medication?

20:14:25&nbsp;
Gary W
but i started vomiting and in the night i vomited stuff that was black

20:14:29&nbsp;
skykingh
yes it seems to 

20:14:35&nbsp;
KelleyK
Kristina, long story short - I have chronic constipation and hardly ever have a BM on my own.  I bought the Flowmaster kit and want to know if it is realistic to do daily enemas, large volume, and for how long to help retrain my colon?

20:15:05&nbsp;
kristina
It is said that coffee enemas were discovered by nurses in hospitals that didn't have access to pain medication and they put coffee in the patients enemas and saw a dramatic decrease in the pain being reported.

20:15:13&nbsp;
kristina
How much coffee do you use in your enemas?

20:15:23&nbsp;
kristina
How intense is your pain?

20:15:31&nbsp;
Gary W
who?

20:15:45&nbsp;
kristina
Daily enemas are a life saver for many people

20:15:46&nbsp;
Gary W
i have never had an enama in my life

20:15:49&nbsp;
KelleyK
I think I have a layer of gunk build up from using Metamucil for a long time without enough water intake....

20:16:06&nbsp;
Gary W
time to start i think

20:16:17&nbsp;
kristina
Gary, an enema sounds like a great place to start.

20:16:32&nbsp;
Gary W
should i get the 4 qt clear bag?

20:16:35&nbsp;
kristina
skykingh

20:16:36&nbsp;
KelleyK
But how long can you do it daily without any harm to the colon?  When do I need to stop and see if my body will work better on its own?

20:16:38&nbsp;
skykingh
my pain is intense, so bad I can't walk at times. I use your one cup per quart plan several times a week

20:16:53&nbsp;
kristina
and then how bad is the pain?

20:17:07&nbsp;
Gary W
i'm single, so i have to be able to do it myself

20:17:15&nbsp;
kristina
The 4 quart silicone enema bag is our highest quality enema bag. It is also our most expensive enema bag.

20:17:28&nbsp;
Gary W
but it should last forever, right?

20:17:32&nbsp;
kristina
If one is going to take regular enemas for years to come, I do recommend the 4 quart silicone enema bag.

20:17:33&nbsp;
skykingh
The intense pain is gone. My feet still bother me bu that is it

20:17:34&nbsp;
Gary W
a good investment

20:18:02&nbsp;
kristina
However, if you aren't sure then one of the Easy Enemas

20:18:19&nbsp;
KelleyK
Is it normal for no solid matter to be coming out when doing daily enemas?  Because that is what is happening to me...just discolored water.

20:18:25&nbsp;
kristina
or even the 2.5 quart vinyl bag

20:18:44&nbsp;
kristina
or the fountain bag

20:19:20&nbsp;
kristina
We do have an Enema Equipment Buying Guide on EnemaBag.com

20:19:58&nbsp;
michael b
greetings to all at the chat, may winter not be to severe to all here.

20:20:00&nbsp;
kristina
I personally and professionally know people who have been taking daily enemas for years and are in excellent health.

20:20:40&nbsp;
Gary W
i think Dr Bernard Jensen was a huge supporter of enamas

20:20:48&nbsp;
Gary W
enemas*

20:20:51&nbsp;
Dave
I have bought one-piece &quot;disposable&quot; bags on OHN and am happy with them.

20:20:54&nbsp;
KelleyK
Just looking for an answer on the no solid stuff coming out and is that normal?  Also are the headaches normal?

20:21:44&nbsp;
kristina
However, each person is different so as you take those day-to-day enemas, you will ideally need to monitor your mineral levels and make sure you do feel better. And, of course, optimize your gut health in other ways through healthy eating, probiotics, implants, good sleep, managing stress and possible vitamin and mineral and glandular supplementation.

20:22:10&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, the silicone 4 quart bag ought to last forever.

20:22:20&nbsp;
KelleyK
I do take a daily vitamin and nightly mineral supplement, probiotics, great sleep, flaxseed

20:22:36&nbsp;
Gary W
can we take that analysis test at home and send it to you for evaluation?

20:23:14&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, if you talk to people who have trained under the influence of Bernard Jensen, they will tell you to use daily enemas for a long time. I once had a naturopathic doctor tell me that EVERYONE needed to take a daily colonic for 6-12 months.

20:23:24&nbsp;
razor
Does anyone get cramps from using goat's milk soap?

20:23:39&nbsp;
kristina
I no longer believe that to be true but it does show his influence as she studied directly with Bernard Jensen.

20:23:51&nbsp;
KelleyK
I get cramping that I have to breathe through, I think it's from gas in the colon

20:24:09&nbsp;
Gary W
wow kelley

20:24:16&nbsp;
Gary W
ouch!

20:24:54&nbsp;
KelleyK
The cramps aren't too bad, though Gary.  I read somewhere to &quot;pant&quot; like a dog when you get a cramp and it helps move things past the cramp!

20:25:09&nbsp;
Gary W
last week i thought i was going to explode

20:25:26&nbsp;
kristina
Ideally, you would be seeing solid stool. If you don't see solid stool then we can tell that your bowel transit time is extremely slow. Also, you will want to supplement with some B Vitamins and a full spectrum probiotic such as our OrthoBiotic

20:26:04&nbsp;
Gary W
is your sale still on Kristina?

20:26:05&nbsp;
kristina
as the body isn't having the time it needs to absorb needed factors in the second half of the colon.

20:26:10&nbsp;
KelleyK
I currently have Jarro Dophilos (sp), which a colon therapist told me was a good probiotic

20:26:17&nbsp;
Gary W
it shows on the website home page

20:26:41&nbsp;
KelleyK
Hmmmm.... well then I'm not sure what to do Kris because these daily enemas aren't putting out any solid stool

20:26:41&nbsp;
michael b
Lisa, the weather reports say it gonna be rainy in texas.

20:26:54&nbsp;
kristina
We have a monthly sale that last 3-5 days. Our last sale was Jan 24-28. Our next sale will be about one month after that sale.

20:27:17&nbsp;
Gary W
so i missed it then

20:27:44&nbsp;
Gary W
did you see my question about the analysis kristina?

20:27:51&nbsp;
Lisa P
Michael, we had some storms yesterday, but now it's beautiful!

20:28:27&nbsp;
kristina
yes, you cut your hair at  home and send it in. The $65 fee includes the testing, the test results and 15 minutes of a consultation, which is almost always what one needs to get started, especially since I don't rigidly time the consult.

20:28:59&nbsp;
Gary W
can i call tomorow and get that?

20:29:15&nbsp;
Gary W
i know i can!

20:29:40&nbsp;
Gary W
and i can get the enama bag and holder etc

20:29:48&nbsp;
Gary W
enema*

20:30:06&nbsp;
KelleyK
Kris, would it be easier for me to call tomorrow and talk to someone about my specific situation?  Can I do that to get some help specific to my problems?

20:30:29&nbsp;
kristina
Jarro-Dophilus is a probiotic that includes: Probiotic Bacteria   4.4 Billion Organisms   * L. rhamnosus R0011 (15.4%)  680 Million    L. casei R0215 (15.4%)  680 Million    L. plantarum R1012 (7.7%)  340 Million    L. acidophilus R0052 (15.4%)  680 Million    B. longum BB536 (morinaga strain) (15.4%)  680 Million    B. breve R0070 (7.7%)  340 Million    Pediococcus acidilactici R1001 (15.3%)  670 Million    Lactococcus diacetylactis R0100 (7.6%)  330 Million   

20:31:36&nbsp;
KelleyK
Yes, I take the Jarro-Dophilus once or more daily as directed.

20:31:47&nbsp;
kristina
As is stated on their website:There are several properties that are required from strains of lactic acid bacteria if these are to result in an efficient probiotic. No single strain can easily fulfill all these requirements. A mixture of species ? like that found in Jarro-Dophilus EPS, is usually most suitable for supplementation. The most desirable properties of a good probiotic are:  -compatibility among the strains -ability to survive passage through the digestive tract -stable under normal gastric conditions -resistant to bile salts -adherence to intestinal mucosa -colonization of the human intestinal tract -safety with regard to human use -production of antimicrobial substances -antagonism against harmful bacteria -stability during storage under normal conditions

20:32:05&nbsp;
bethm
When I get a under the weather, my anus burns much like a cold burns around your nose. Any suggestions.  

20:32:32&nbsp;
skykingh
How long does it usually take you to get the results of the hair test and saliva test. I completed it and put it in the mail today

20:32:42&nbsp;
KelleyK
So are you saying Jarro-Dophilus is good or bad?

20:33:33&nbsp;
kristina
In addition, I have found that if your goal is to bring about a thriving population of the healthy bacteria, you will also want an organism that helps to weed out the unhealthy bacteria such as Saccharomyces boulardii

20:35:15&nbsp;
KelleyK
It's crazy in here.  Kris, asking again - would it be easier for me to call tomorrow and talk to someone about my specific situation? Can I do that to get some help specific to my problems?

20:35:30&nbsp;
razor
do you think supplements are needed if you only take weekly to bi-weekly enemas?

20:35:46&nbsp;
kristina
Saccharomyces boulardii is a tropical strain of yeast that unhealthy intestinal organisms bind to. S. boulardii and then are eliminated from the body during the next bowel movement

20:36:24&nbsp;
kristina
One can always call our office. If we don't answer we will call you back. You can also email me personally at kristina@optimalhealthnetwork.com anytime.

20:37:34&nbsp;
michael b
Kristina, china chlorella makes me throw up in large doses, for a binding agent, can i subsitute activated charcoal? how much?  

20:37:54&nbsp;
kristina
We have so much to learn about how to optimize the gut flora. It is now know that the average human body, consists of about 10,000,000,000,000 (ten trillion) cells, has about ten times that number of microorganisms in the gut. There's an estimate of about 500 different bacterial species in the intestine. The metabolic activity performed by these bacteria is equal to that of a virtual organ making the gut bacteria termed as a &quot;forgotten&quot; organ.

20:37:56&nbsp;
Gary W
thank you kristina... i will order my stuff tomorrow

20:38:15&nbsp;
kristina
You could also try calling tonight after the chat, if you have time.

20:38:35&nbsp;
kristina
Hi Michael, you can try charcoal.

20:38:37&nbsp;
KelleyK
I could definitely call tonight!  

20:38:52&nbsp;
KelleyK
Just call the posted phone number at 8:00?

20:39:09&nbsp;
kristina
give it a try. I can't promise but I will try 

20:39:36&nbsp;
KelleyK
Okay.  Thank you very much for your time and help.

20:39:50&nbsp;
kristina
But I have found better results with Chlorophyll Complex from Standard Process. 

20:40:05&nbsp;
KelleyK
I will stop and let others get some help now.  Sorry to all for being loud and persistent!

20:40:15&nbsp;
kristina
I believe it works well because it contains Tillandsia usneoides

20:40:21&nbsp;
Gary W
good luck kelley

20:40:51&nbsp;
KelleyK
Good luck to you too Gary. You'll get past this blip, I'm sure

20:41:00&nbsp;
Gary W
i know i will

20:41:05&nbsp;
Lisa P
Sorry, I got bumped off. Did the same happen to you Dave?

20:41:07&nbsp;
Gary W
so will you

20:41:14&nbsp;
kristina
or Spanish Moss

20:41:39&nbsp;
bethm
When I get under the weather, my anus burns much like a cold burns around your nose. Any suggestions?

20:41:39&nbsp;
kristina
It is great to have so much interest. Thank you.

20:41:49&nbsp;
skykingh
I hope when you get my results from the hair test and saliva test that I can cut back on the OHC Supplements. It is getting very expensive

20:42:13&nbsp;
kristina
Do you have hemorrhoids?

20:43:02&nbsp;
bethm
not to my knowledge, but I noticed a little blood when wiping

20:43:45&nbsp;
kristina
Super Salve is an inexpensive salve that I would have on  hand.

20:43:59&nbsp;
kristina
If you have fresh blood when wiping, it is likely you have hemorroids.

20:44:01&nbsp;
Dave
Yes Lisa.

20:44:16&nbsp;
kristina
If you start using the super salve daily, those ought to go away.

20:44:53&nbsp;
bethm
i have super salve.  do you suggest enema at this time.  i've got minor flue symptoms like feeling cold, headache;

20:45:23&nbsp;
kristina
Enemas work well for those symptoms.

20:45:49&nbsp;
bethm
i also had started on this thisalyn cleanse.  i don't know if that is making things worse

20:45:54&nbsp;
25552
is it possible to heal a hemorroid

20:47:16&nbsp;
kristina
The dosage with activated charcoal in adults is 520-975 mg after each meal and up to 5 g per day.

20:47:40&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, it is possible to heal hemorroids

20:48:15&nbsp;
25552
please tell me how

20:49:11&nbsp;
michael b
Bethm, are you in all misery of winter, and taking that in consideration?

20:49:36&nbsp;
Katy C
Hello Kristina and all. Sorry I'm so late but good to catch the end of chat.

20:50:15&nbsp;
kristina
Make sure the bowels are moving easily on a daily basis, nourish the tissues of the anal area with super salve daily,

20:50:38&nbsp;
Lisa P
Kristina, I hope you can take a little time to update us on how your Mom is doing!

20:50:53&nbsp;
25552
ok thank you

20:51:33&nbsp;
kristina
use the olive oil, aloe vera and MSM implant one time per week.

20:52:09&nbsp;
kristina
Thanks for asking, Lisa. My mom had a mild hemorrhagic stroke last Tuesday.

20:52:28&nbsp;
kristina
She spent last week in the ICU at the University of Wisconsin Hospital.

20:53:16&nbsp;
kristina
She is now at home. She has full use of her arms and legs. She can now swallow. She sleeps most of the time and she is, to say the least, sad.

20:53:55&nbsp;
kristina
She hasn't smoked all week, which is heroic on her part, since she has smoked since she was 19 and she is now 64. 

20:54:15&nbsp;
kristina
She has a tough time ahead of her but I am fully confident that she can grow and heal through this.

20:54:20&nbsp;
Lisa P
What a relief she didn't have any damage! Please give her my love.

20:54:43&nbsp;
kristina
We need to learn more about how to heal her vascular system as it appears she has pretty extensive vascular disease.

20:55:07&nbsp;
kristina
We did almost lose her.

20:55:09&nbsp;
Lisa P
She's still young, that helps!

20:55:16&nbsp;
kristina
Very young.

20:56:24&nbsp;
kristina
a hemorrhagic stroke is caused by a blood vessel in the brain that breaks and bleeds into the brain. About 20 percent of strokes are hemorrhagic. 

20:56:33&nbsp;

Cut off second time.

I didn't know the signs of a stroke so here they are for all of you:

20:56:54&nbsp;
kristina
The symptoms of stroke are distinct because they happen quickly:      * Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm, or leg (especially on one side of the body)     * Sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding speech     * Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes     * Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination     * Sudden severe headache with no known cause 

20:57:30&nbsp;

Every minute counts when someone is having a stroke. The longer blood flow is cut off to the brain, the greater the damage. Immediate treatment can save people's lives and enhance their chances for successful recovery.   

20:57:46&nbsp;

If you believe someone is having a stroke ? if he or she suddenly loses the ability to speak, or move an arm or leg on one side, or experiences facial paralysis on one side ? call 911 immediately.

My mom spent the day at home, thinking she was &quot;just&quot; sick. 

20:58:12&nbsp;
Lisa P
Were you with her when it happened?

20:58:17&nbsp;
kristina
I had asked her if she needed any support, but as usual she said no.

20:58:30&nbsp;
kristina
I was at work. She was supposed to come in and help that day.

20:59:08&nbsp;
kristina
She called and talked to me for quite some time. I knew her voice was different but I hadn't any prior experience with strokes so I had no idea.

20:59:49&nbsp;
kristina
And, she had no idea. Finally, Rayna, my 7 year old daughter heard her voice and said we must go over there right away. As soon as I saw her face, I knew she had had a stroke. 

21:00:10&nbsp;
kristina
She had never looked in the mirror and I don't know if she would of seen it even if she had.
