Welcome. We start in 5 minutes. You can post anything in the meantime, but I am going to start posting some information about our work with a variety of hormonal imbalance situations.

12:56:02

Though our work with Dr. Janet Lang of Restorative Endocrinology, we are now able to offer a full spectrum service for hormonal imbalances. Here are a list of some of possible scenarios we can work with:

Ok.  I have been daily coffee enemas while I'm healing from adrenal fatigue, mono, hormonal and nutritional imbalances, leaky gut, and candida overgrowth.  I just read your post about the how-to's of giving yourself an enema that works. Looking forward to it.

Thanks to your site, i've found several hydrotherapists here that will do enemas

13:00:40

as well as colonics

13:00:43
kristina
That is great, Thundershorts. Where is this? Let them know that people continually ask us about other therapists that will give enemas, so if they contact me, I can let others know.

13:00:53

How is your healing process coming along, Jo? What else are you doing?

13:02:12
pamjmcgrath
I'm new to enemas and purchased the coffee enema kit from you.  I have tried it once, with limited success.  I only did about 3.5 quarts of a regular enema first.  Should i do more?  I use water, sea salt and lavender EO.

13:02:24
kristina
Yes, if you are experienced at giving yourself an enema, you are going to be more skilled at giving others enemas.

13:02:54
kristina
Taking 3.5 quarts of water is a lot. Why do you say you had limited success?

13:03:17
pamjmcgrath
I could only hold the coffee for about 5 minutes

13:03:30
kristina
I forgot to send out a live chat announcement outside of the newsletter. Seems those announcements work well. I am glad that the 3 of you are here!

13:03:34
Jo
My healing is slow. however I have released the bulk of my candida overgrowth with the help of capryllic acid and a low glycemic diet. The enemas really help me feel better, esp. after an epsom bath. My favorite time of day! I'm excited to try your method.

13:03:58
kristina
You don't need to take that much coffee into the colon in order to get the therapeutic effects of the coffee enema.

13:04:13
kristina
My most recent newsletter that came out yesterday talks about this in detail.

Is anyone else in southern CA?

13:06:48
Jo
I'm in northern CA

13:06:53
kristina
Yes! Yes and yes again! 

13:06:58
Doug W.
I'm in Pa

13:07:39
kristina
Yes, you can heal. I myself had a similar set of health problems and I have healed and we have worked with many very difficult cases with adrenal fatigue, hormonal imbalances, etc.

13:08:12
Jo
that's so helpful to hear! do you have an article on those details?

13:08:14
kristina
I like those Californians. My son is working to get into a college in southern CA. If he does, I hope to visit lots.

13:08:59
kristina
The information is all throughout the site. I will think about specific articles as we go along here.

13:09:10
kristina
My book, Ten Days to Optimal Health, is also a good source.

13:09:37
Dave
Just a tale, or are colonics/enemas fairly popular in S. California vs. other places?

13:09:39
kristina
Our testimonials are also another great place to look.

13:10:09
kristina
I do need more stories on the site, though.

13:10:15
kristina
Welcome, Jon!

13:10:20
Jo
Yes, in CA there are more folks doing alternative health, so there's more choices and more support. thanks for the info Kristina!  Yes, there's a colonic place in my town, 5 min. away, and I go to a place that does gravity colonics, about 15 min. away

13:11:15
Jo
but I'm SO excited about your latest newsletter's info about how to do more efficient enemas that are done at HOME and are free, compared to colonics.

13:11:36
Jon
May I ask a question about enemas?

13:11:43
Dave
Enema offerings like OHC probably scare there, I would guess.

13:11:58
Doug W.
Do you know of any colonics in eastern states?

13:12:15
thundershorts
it seems that a lot of colon hydrotherapists discouage enemas as they think they are bad for business

13:12:34
kristina
Yes, it is great to have access to colon hydrotherapists and to use their services and you can clear out the entire colon as effectively at home

yes

Liver Detox to Optimize Hormonal Health

13:14:34
Jon
Kristina, I have your 2 quart bucket system, and I hear you always saying to take in 3 or even 4 quarts of water for an enema, but about 95% of the time I can only get 1/2 or 3/4 of a quart in before I have to release it... do you have any tips?

13:14:57

13:16:59

Do you take the enema solution into your colon slowly?

13:17:05
Jo
I had that experience of overdose on bio identical. took me months of work with an acupuncturist and massage therapist to release them. Now, I have extremely low progesterone and my naturopath has me back on the bio identicals for just a short time.

13:18:08
Jon
I think I do, but I guess I could always try even slower. 

13:18:15

welcome back doug w

13:18:22
kristina
We need to consider all of the following for a successful liver detox:

13:18:52
kristina
Nutrients to engage Phases I and II liver detoxification 

13:18:54
thundershorts
welcome michael b

13:19:08
kristina
proper bile flow to carry the toxins out of the liver

13:19:28
kristina
otherwise you can just rearrange the toxins in the liver

13:19:50
Jo
do the coffee enemas help to remove the bile from the liver?  Especially since I have no gallbladder?

13:19:55
kristina
How about putting 2-6 T of water into the colon every 30-60 seconds?

13:20:03
kristina
Also, for many, the sea salt really helps.

13:20:54
kristina
back to liver detox considerations:

13:21:14
kristina
Sufficient fiber to bind the toxins in the intestines, otherwise they can be reabsorbed.

13:21:23
kristina
good bowel function and bowel flora

13:21:31
kristina
plenty of quality water

13:21:32
Jon
how can we properly blend in the peppermint essential oil with the water since it always seems to sit on top of the water?

13:22:33
kristina
For supplements, we use LivCo to engage and co-ordinate Phase I and II liver detox. We also use Livaplex for overall liver support. It contains the phytonutrients needed to drive phase I and II liver detox. Some of the peppermint will always sit at the top.

13:24:19
michael b
i read where you are off to guatemala - you won't need studded tires or down booties there.

13:24:22
kristina
Just stir the water well and a portion of the peppermint will be dispersed throughout the water.

13:24:33
kristina
thank goodness

13:24:42
kristina
yes, we are going to Guatemala. 

13:24:43
Jon
thank you

13:25:05
kristina
For a bit, I thought we might not go as there is a lot of crime there due to poverty and oppressive governments,

13:25:34
kristina
Jo, if you read through my live chats, you will find a lot of information there, too.

13:25:46
kristina

13:26:06
Jo
Ok, thanks Kristina!

13:26:59
pamjmcgrath
Be sure to add your peppermint oil to the sea salt BEFORE dispersing the salt/oil mixture into the water.

13:27:28
kristina
Yes, the coffee enemas assist the liver with bile production and flow. Bile production is one of the most vital functions of the liver and it is necessary for the appropriate absorption of nutrients from the intestine.

13:27:54
Jon
I just started to do the enema twice a week. I am always wondering if it is just my stool coming out and that maybe what I am doing is useless. How can I know for sure that I am benefiting from the enema? (Jon's wife this time) 

13:28:01
Jo
I love getting information. thanks 

13:30:42
kristina
We also recommend Cholacol

13:30:44
kristina
Cholacol provides a concentrated source of bile salts that will support the healthy metabolism and absorption of dietary fat when the gallbladder has been surgically removed.

13:31:24
kristina
Great idea, Pamjmcgrath.

13:31:39
kristina
What ends up in the toilet when you release the enema solution?

13:32:56
kristina
Hi Jon's wife!

13:32:57
kristina
More on Cholacol

13:33:59
Jon
Lots of brown liquid, definitely some undigested food and some stool. I often get loose stool so it does tend to look similar to normal except for a lot of brown liquid.

13:34:34
kristina
This is all good!

13:34:45
kristina
Do you feel differently from taking the enemas?

13:35:14
kristina
Do your bowels move on the usual schedule even though you are taking the two times weekly enemas?

13:35:24
kristina
How often do your bowels move when you don't take the enemas?

13:35:46
kristina
Have I missed anything?

13:35:49
michael b
you and who else?

13:36:41
kristina
What type of bio identical hormones, cream or sublingual?

13:37:05
Jo
cream progestereone

13:37:16
kristina
And, are you being tested using a multiple sample saliva test?

13:37:49
kristina
When using the creams one needs to be tested at least every 3 months.

13:38:12
Jo
I've been tested for hormones several times with the saliva test. most recently, my naturopath did a blood test.  however, my prog. is always low! maybe due to the adrenal fatigue.

13:38:19
Jon
Yes sometimes really tired and other times refreshed and lighter like I feel that I might start benefiting from the food that I eat by absorbing the nutrients better. I definitely do eliminate every day.

13:38:46
Jon
But I think I do have inflammation because it is often loose stool.

13:39:02
Jo
Kristina, does candida overgrowth die-off cause constipation?

13:39:13
kristina
also be careful about touching others with the area of the body the cream is being put on, as topical hormone preparations are often &quot;shared&quot; via skin-to-skin contact which can cause all sorts of issues with partners, kids, pets...

13:39:30
Jo
yes, I knew that.

13:39:34
kristina
candida overgrowth die-off can cause constipation

13:40:15
Jo
since starting the capyrillic acid about a month ago, I have not had any bm's without doing an enema.  too constipated. so I do it every day for now.

13:40:15
kristina
are you cycling or not cycling?

13:40:35
Jo
cycling with medium blood flow and some small clots

13:41:12
kristina
My daughters, Rayna and Johannah and a friend named Jonah

13:41:49
kristina
sounds like inflammation. Do you have any other symptoms?

13:42:13
kristina
And it sounds as if you are eliminating additional wastes with the enemas than if you weren't taking them,  yeah?

13:42:59
Jo
not really.  just the diagnosis of leaky gut and candida.  and yes, I am sure I'm eliminating additional wastes.

13:43:44
Jo
Kristina, have you heard of the Gerson therapy?  and of Ann Wigmore?

13:43:57
kristina
It is possible that your body is &quot;stealing&quot; your progesterone to make cortisol to deal with stress and/or adrenal exhaustion?

13:44:00
Jo
they've used coffee enemas for themselves and patients

13:44:09
kristina
yes, I have, Jo

13:44:20
Jo
yes, I think the body is stealing the prog.

13:44:35
Jon
Yes, it is hard to say  but I am still doing the enemas just because I think that I might start noticing the benfits in the long run. Does that make sense?

13:44:51
kristina
so, we need to work on the adrenal glands in order to optimize the progesterone levels?

13:44:55
Jon
something tells me that just getting water inside my colon is good.

13:45:00
kristina
yes, Jon's wife!

13:45:23
Jo
yes I'm taking isocort

13:46:05
kristina
Progesterone is a steroid hormone produced in the ovaries and adrenal glands.

13:46:26
kristina
Progesterone is also produced by the brain and peripheral nerves and possibly other locations.

13:47:22
Jon
I have a very good diet but the only thing that I am now addressing is overeating, a lifelong habit for me that  I see can definitely contributes to my inflammation. Can enemas help with that?

13:47:56
Jon
I eat lots of cultured vegetables and kefir from young coconut.

13:47:59
kristina
For some, enemas help with overeating but blood sugar regulation is the most effective tool.

13:48:04
kristina
Eat small meals often. 

13:48:13
kristina
Always eat protein and fat with each meal.

13:48:17
kristina
To learn more, go to:

13:48:39
kristina
#1 Health Tip: Eat every 2 to 2½ hours throughout the day, each and every day.

13:49:50
kristina
Also, we work with the Ayurvedic herb, Gymnema.

13:49:57
kristina
Gymnema maintains healthy blood sugar levels when combined with a balanced diet.

13:50:20
Jon
Sometimes I also think it is emotional issues that I need to address

13:50:40
kristina
Most people find that by taking one or two rounds (bottles) of this herb, they lose their sweet and carb cravings.

13:50:42
Dave
Speaking of overeating, especially tomorrow, are colonics and enema series in special demand at OHC, elsewhere? I had one therapist say that.

13:50:48
Jon
I eat no sugar , no fruits, and even no grains at the moment.

13:50:55
kristina
This is also key, for all of us!

13:51:06
michael b
it seems progesterone is used for just about everything - is that always good? do you sell Gymnema?

13:51:25
kristina
We are closed on Thanksgiving.

13:51:38
Jo
Jon, your diet sounds a lot like mine!  I'm wanting to start coconut kefirs. i do green smoothies and lots of veggies.

13:52:13
kristina
Yes, we do sell Gymnema. One needs to call us up as we don't offer it on the website due to Standard Process policy of always starting on these supplements only with a consult first.

13:52:30
Dave
I meant after the holiday.

13:52:31
Jon
Me too! 

13:52:39
Jo
Kristina, I'm having a hard time trying to add the grass-fed protein (meat!) to my diet!  I do eggs though.

13:52:39
kristina
Yes, optimal progesterone levels are key to good health.

13:52:48
kristina
However, all of our hormones function in a family.

13:53:00
kristina
Hormones are not the same as supplements.

13:53:10
kristina
By giving hormones, we can imbalance the rest of the family.

13:53:41
Jo
thanks everybody for this chat!  I needed some inspiration today. it's been a long road of healing.

13:53:58
Jon
Thank you Krisitina for all your help. I know I asked a lot of questions:)  (jon's wife)

13:54:07
michael b
what you mean, is it all a plot to live better?

13:54:08
kristina
for instance, in the case of Jo, if her progesterone is being &quot;stolen&quot; to make cortisol then she will have more trouble in the long run due to things like tissue breakdown, adrenal fatigue, etc.

13:54:16
Jo
just knowing other folks are doing coffee enemas and experiencing healing helps me!

13:54:21
