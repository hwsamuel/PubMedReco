One topic I am going to talk about today is the coffee enema.

20:00:51&nbsp;
Cathy
Hello. I just looked at the Hair Analysis Ratio Worksheet and am wondering if that is what one gets as a result of hair analysis test? 

20:01:40&nbsp;
kristina
Can you each tell me if you use coffee enemas? How often? How much coffee do you use? Do you cleanse your colon first? What type of coffee do you use? 

20:01:42&nbsp;
Dave
As I said in e-mail, subject of bifudis probiotic would be a good topic. Both local therapists endorse, and do themselves.

20:01:58&nbsp;
kristina
Great question, Cathy.

20:02:01&nbsp;
kristina
Yes and no.

20:02:26&nbsp;
Cathy
please explain

20:02:38&nbsp;
kristina
The HTMA worksheet is what we use to analyze the ratios on one's hair analysis results.

20:03:13&nbsp;
Cathy
So my result sheet is compared against that sheet?

20:03:32&nbsp;
Lisa P.
I do coffee enemas only once in a while. Maybe I should do one since I can't shake off this cold I have. I think I must have a fever. Really bad.

20:04:05&nbsp;
kristina
The results on the actual HTMA show mineral levels, toxic metal levels and compare the ratios of some of the minerals.

20:04:41&nbsp;
Lisa P.
When I do a coffee enema, I do about a quart and hold it for 15 minutes. I use the OHN coffee!

20:04:48&nbsp;
Cathy
thanks. looks much more informative than the last hair analysis I had

20:04:57&nbsp;
kristina
These ratios give us information about one's thyroid health, adrenal health, ability to handle carbohydrates, protein utilization, hormone health...

20:07:08&nbsp;
Cathy
I used to do coffee enemas (ce) but now I get very toxic and angry the day after one so I am going to try taking bentonite after a ce and see if that helps me not to absorb the toxins I'm assuming are dumping but not exiting well enough. 

20:07:15&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, Lisa, I have just posted on the home page about the usefulness of the coffee enema during this time of year. I recommend one per week.

20:07:50&nbsp;
michael b
i have tried only your OHN coffee, using 1 cup of coffee to 1 quart of water

20:07:55&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, I have found that the HTMA is an excellent and inexpensive tool to work with a person's individualized biochemistry.

20:07:57&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Thanks Kris! I'll look at it.

20:08:49&nbsp;
Lisa P.
I also use one cup of coffee in one quart of water.

20:09:27&nbsp;
Cathy
Now that I see how it can be used I will likely be calling to order HTMA

20:09:41&nbsp;
Dave
I also use OHN but not often enough. View cold season, agree it's time for more.

20:09:52&nbsp;
Lisa P.
I never used any other kind of coffee for an enema. Just OHN's coffee, and that works very well.

20:10:44&nbsp;
kristina
Great, Cathy. You can also order the HTMA online.

20:11:14&nbsp;
Dave
In childhood, enemas seemed to come mostly in winter. Is it the same pattern in  your colonic clients too, Kris?

20:11:22&nbsp;
kristina
Here is a link to our enema coffee.

20:12:02&nbsp;
kristina
No, Dave, we don't have more clients in the winter than we do in the summer.

20:12:43&nbsp;
kristina
Also, Cathy, have I answered all your questions about the HTMA?

20:12:48&nbsp;
Cathy
Kris, I use OHN coffee too. Used to use 1 tbl. in 4cups but now even a 1/4tsp causes problems. What do you think of using bentonite to absorb toxins dumped after coffee enema?

20:13:30&nbsp;
Cathy
Kris, all the questions I can think of right now, thank you.

20:14:03&nbsp;
kristina
We have developed our enema coffee to increase its therapeutic content.

20:14:06&nbsp;
Dave
Good you're good year round. One therapist here sees pickup in Thanksgiving/New year's period. 

20:15:49&nbsp;
kristina
The veins of the anus are very close to the surface of the inner colon. The caffeine is therefore absorbed quickly into the portal vein system.

20:16:09&nbsp;
michael b
have wondered if more than 1 quart, 2 or 3 of this mixture should be taken, and retained for 12 to 15 minutes, after a previous cleansing series

20:16:16&nbsp;
Dave
So I take it that it need not be instilled high.

20:17:03&nbsp;
kristina
Caffeine, theophylline and theobromine, elements in the coffee, combine to stimulate the relaxation of smooth muscles causing dilatation of blood vessels and bile ducts.

20:17:54&nbsp;
kristina
The enzymes in coffee, palmitates, assist the liver to carry away the toxins in bile acid.

20:18:04&nbsp;
Lisa P.
I have taken a two quart coffee enema before, but holding more than that, I couldn't manage.

20:19:17&nbsp;
kristina
additional coffee enema materials

20:19:36&nbsp;
kristina
and more about the coffee enema on EnemaBag.com

20:20:24&nbsp;
kristina
Also, my video &quot;Cleansing, Coffee Enemas and Colon Tubes&quot; is very useful.

20:21:16&nbsp;
Lisa P.
That's a good video!

20:21:22&nbsp;
kristina
and, I am now on youtube: Coffee Enema Video Clip 1

20:21:41&nbsp;
kristina
and Coffee Enema Video Clip 2

20:22:09&nbsp;
Cathy
is there a way to know if my ileocecal valve is stuck open and is that a problem to be corrected? If a life history of constipation can cause it then I likely do have that issue. great, I will check out your videos.

20:22:35&nbsp;
kristina
What problems do you have from taking the coffee enemas?

20:22:58&nbsp;
Lisa P.
I'll have to see that on youtube! You should also put up your piano playing!!

20:23:17&nbsp;
Cathy
If you mean me (Cathy), I get very angry the next day.

20:24:04&nbsp;
kristina
Thanks, Lisa.

20:24:10&nbsp;
kristina
Are you on You Tube?

20:24:30&nbsp;
kristina
Do you intake caffeine in any other way?

20:24:47&nbsp;
Cathy
No.

20:25:05&nbsp;
Lisa P.
No, but I'm thinking of putting something up!

20:25:47&nbsp;
kristina
One doesn't need to take much coffee at all. It is important not to feel "buzzed" after a coffee enema.

20:26:04&nbsp;
kristina
Do you feel angry the next day after a water enema?

20:26:11&nbsp;
Cathy
No

20:26:55&nbsp;
Dave
If ready for another topic, this one: therapists advocate emptying powder from two bifudis capsules into a Fleet-type bottle, filling with ionized, alkalined water (Essentia at Whole Foods) and implanting for 20 minutes. Sound right?

20:27:17&nbsp;
kristina
It sounds like you have weak adrenal glands. Do you think that is possible? Do you find yourself irritable if you don't eat every few hours or if you don't eat enough protein throughout the day? 

20:27:27&nbsp;
kristina
Certainly the HTMA would give us this information.

20:28:04&nbsp;
Cathy
Yes, adrenal issues have seemed to be an issue. Yes on the HTMA. Thanks. 

20:28:34&nbsp;
michael b
I drink 1 cup in the am.your coffee tastes great. 

20:29:55&nbsp;
kristina
Dave, I, too recommend this treatment. Certainly one has many choices for what type of enema equipment they use to do the implant. I recommend Bifidonate Large Intestine Support.

20:30:24&nbsp;
kristina
We have an implant syringe.

20:31:14&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, I drink the enema coffee, too. It is extremely tasty, isn't it? I think it is fun to give to people, too, because it gets the conversation going about coffee enemas and the colon cleanse.

20:31:27&nbsp;
Dave
Thanks, and i agree OHN coffee is good orally too, lol.

20:32:11&nbsp;
Cathy
When do I have access to the links of this chat, when does this get archived?

20:32:35&nbsp;
Lisa P.
I never tried the OHN coffee orally. Just through the culo!

20:32:52&nbsp;
kristina
Cathy, do stay away from using coffee in your enema for now, until you have recovered your adrenal glands. 

20:32:56&nbsp;
Dave
Good question, Cathy. Me too.

20:33:16&nbsp;
Cathy
Thank you

20:34:25&nbsp;
Cathy
I have started taking L-tyrosine with B-6 recently and that seems to be helping energy and brain and so hopefully adrenals too.

20:34:25&nbsp;
kristina
Usually the next day. The link is on right side of the home page: Archive: Live Chat Logs.

20:35:55&nbsp;
michael b
I still drink coffee to wake up in the morning.

20:37:27&nbsp;
Cathy
I was eating a small piece of organic dark chocolate for that (wake up) until my gallbladder told me to stop it!

20:38:14&nbsp;
kristina
Coffee enemas are also being used as a holistic treatment for cancer. A main proponent of the coffee enema for cancer is New York medical doctor Nicholas Gonzalez.

20:38:43&nbsp;
kristina
Having strong adrenal glands is the best way to support the body to wake up feeling refreshed.

20:39:24&nbsp;
kristina
Certainly, for most, drinking small amounts of coffee during the day can be therapeutic. There is a lot of research that shows that coffee consumption is beneficial against colon cancer.

20:39:50&nbsp;
kristina
However, if you wake up feeling tired, there is recovery and regeneration work to do.

20:40:21&nbsp;
kristina
Michael, I would be honored to work with you using the hair analysis. It has been a long time since we have had a chance to work together.

20:40:40&nbsp;
kristina
The effectiveness of Gonzalez's regimen is being studied by the by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM).

20:41:37&nbsp;
Cathy
Is gallbladder area feeling tight/tender a sign of sludge? I had ultrasound and no stones showed up but I hear that only calcium shows up and cholesterol could still be packing the gallbladder.  

20:42:10&nbsp;
Cathy
I've heard that the cancer clinics in Mexico use lots of ce's as part of treatment.

20:42:25&nbsp;
kristina
The second link is information about the coffee enema treatment used by Gonzalez from the National Cancer Institute

20:42:56&nbsp;
michael b
this is why i like getting to these chats - you always have new stuff!  

20:43:13&nbsp;
kristina
Thanks, Michael. I sure do like having you here.

20:43:27&nbsp;
Cathy
The chat is helping me to feel motivated to work with you Kris.

20:43:51&nbsp;
kristina
The Gonzalez regimen trial was a 7-year clinical study that compared the effectiveness of standard treatment with that of the Gonzalez regimen in treating patients who had pancreatic cancer that could not be removed by surgery 

20:43:56&nbsp;
Dave
I know some celebs (Steve McQueen for example) went the coffee enema route but too late as a last step. Who knows, maybe earlier would have worked.

20:44:58&nbsp;
kristina
L-tyrosine can be converted by neurons in the brain and in the adrenal medulla of the adrenal glands to dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and epinephrine hormones which are depleted by stress, overwork, and certain drugs. By replenishing norepinephrine in the brain, mental energy levels are enhanced and a feeling of contentment often occurs.

20:45:42&nbsp;
Cathy
ahhh, I do feel less stressed since taking L-Tyro

20:46:20&nbsp;
michael b
Steve McQueen was in merchant marine, lots of asbestos in the ships.

20:46:50&nbsp;
kristina
If the gallbladder area is tight/tender it can be because you are impacted. It can be due to a slow transit time. 

20:47:42&nbsp;
kristina
Awesome, Cathy!

20:48:24&nbsp;
Cathy
Sounds possible to me too. I wish I could see inside my colon without colonoscopy*) *) :D 

20:49:16&nbsp;
michael b
these chats seem to go by so quickly, so everybody have a great 2009!

20:49:32&nbsp;
Dave
Nice to know government is looking at coffee enemas, other alternatives. Enemas not exactly a current establishment favorite, as we know.

20:49:49&nbsp;
Cathy
You too Michael

20:50:55&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Because we will close in a few minutes, I want a chance to say happy holidays to everyone!!

20:51:08&nbsp;
kristina
During certain times, in order to  aid the liver in its enormous job of detoxifying your body, you may need to take coffee enemas as often as one to two  times daily.

20:51:42&nbsp;
kristina
The movie we  have produced, &quot;Cleansing, Coffee Enemas  and Colon Tubes,&quot; teaches  how to remove toxins  from your body, too.

20:52:13&nbsp;
kristina
Colon cleansing, and particularly coffee enemas, increase the flow of bile out of your body. Thus, if you are  quitting smoking, take coffee enemas, after your cleansing  enemas, one to seven times per week. Once the nicotine is  out of the body, all physical withdrawal will cease.

20:52:20&nbsp;
Dave
Cathy, they do have "virtual colonoscopy" that doesn't involve insertion, but the prep is the same.

20:52:46&nbsp;
Cathy
Thanks. I look forward to be able to do more ce's. Is there any thing else I can do for adrenals?

20:53:19&nbsp;
kristina
Our next Live Chat will be on Wednesday, January 14th, at 7pm. I will very much look forward to it and to interacting with each of you in the meantime.

20:53:50&nbsp;
Cathy
Thanks Dave. It's the prep that concerns me. I'm chemically hypersensitive and the laxative, I hear, makes many people sick. 

20:54:35&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, you can clear out the entire colon in order to prep for the colonoscopy using in home enemas. You would need to take the enema series, which I detail on www.enemabag.com.

20:55:02&nbsp;
kristina
With the coffee enema, it is always best to take at least 2 enemas before you take the coffee enema. 

20:55:02&nbsp;
Cathy
Lots of good links to check out. 

20:55:11&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Cathy, I hope you will be back next month. I like having you here. You ask some very good questions!

20:55:56&nbsp;
Cathy
Thank you. I plan to be here. This is great inspiration.

20:56:20&nbsp;
michael b
is there much absorbing done in other parts of the colon,other first inches,and  is that also positive?

20:56:29&nbsp;
kristina
With the coffee enema, hold the solution for a full twelve to fifteen minutes  in order to allow the coffee to do its work of stimulating the  liver. For more information on the health-giving benefits of  coffee enemas, you can also refer to the Implant Recipes in my book, Kristina Amelong's Ten Days to Optimal Health.

20:56:48&nbsp;
Dave
Next chat date? And happy and healthy times at the holidays meantime.

20:57:24&nbsp;
Lisa P.
January 14th! See you then!

20:57:45&nbsp;
kristina
There are many positions that can be used when receiving an enema.  1) Lying on the right side knees bent up; 2) Lying on the left side knees bent up; 3) Head down and backside up; 4) On your back

20:58:36&nbsp;
michael b
how is arlo?

20:59:11&nbsp;
Cathy
Something I wasn't doing that I need to, is to do the water enemas ahead of the ce.

20:59:30&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Kris has a dog named arlo, and my son's name is arlo!!

21:00:17&nbsp;
kristina
The blood vessels of the rectum and anus absorb the coffee so you simply don't need the coffee solution to go higher than this. There is no harm in the enema coffee solution going higher into the colon.

21:00:29&nbsp;
kristina
Good-Bye to all.

21:00:46&nbsp;
kristina
Arlo, my dog, is great!

21:01:03&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Have a happy new year!!

21:01:07&nbsp;
michael b
today's riddle? hope both arlos are great

21:01:26&nbsp;
Lisa P.
My Arlo is great too! lol!

21:01:41&nbsp;
Dave
yes Cathy, you need to be cleaned and emptied out as well as possible first to help absorption, retention.

21:01:49&nbsp;
kristina
See you next year!

21:01:53&nbsp;
Cathy
Good-Bye and thank you and Merry Christmas to all and a Happy New Year.

21:02:05&nbsp;
Cathy
Thanks for all the sharing.

21:02:24&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Ciao!!

21:02:30&nbsp;

happy winter solstice
