Please let me know if anyone has any questions or concerns or comments about their health, about colon cleansing, about using enemas, about our new stool analysis.

20:03:29&nbsp;
kristina
One of the main topics tonight is probiotics.

20:03:37&nbsp;
kristina
Do any of you take probiotics daily?

20:03:42&nbsp;
kristina
Why?

20:04:00&nbsp;
ltrail
Hello, 

20:04:06&nbsp;
kristina
Hello.

20:04:19&nbsp;
ltrail
Hi Kristina

20:04:23&nbsp;
Dave
Since travel and its complications to our colons is typical, I have suggested we share on this topic with advice from Kristina.

20:04:26&nbsp;
Lisa P.
I want to tell you all something about an enema I took last night. It might take me some time to type it, but I'll start doing it.

20:04:40&nbsp;
kristina
Or why not?

20:04:57&nbsp;
Mike K
What kind of tests do you perform on the stool samples?

20:05:04&nbsp;
ealincoln
I would love to hear about travel & colon health.  I can't seem to go when I'm away from home

20:05:51&nbsp;
ltrail
I agree.  Traveling makes it difficult

20:06:13&nbsp;
kristina
Take a look at OHN's testing services to see what the stool analysis tests for.

20:06:19&nbsp;
Lisa P.
One of the reasons I want to tell you about this is because of how great the OHN goatmilk soap is.

20:06:59&nbsp;
ealincoln
I tried the goatmilk soap but it caused a lot of cramping.  Is that normal?

20:07:10&nbsp;
kristina
Generally, it tests for candida, parasites, c. difficile, dairy, gluten, egg and soy intolerances.

20:07:31&nbsp;
ltrail
Kristina.  I am very concerned about loss of potassium and have been found on several occassions with low (2.9) values.  Any way to test this personally?

20:08:00&nbsp;
kristina
No, it isn't common for the goat milk soap to cause cramping. Do you have cramping when you use other enema solutions?

20:08:14&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Last night I was in so much pain. My stomach felt very tight, and I knew I couldn't go on like that. It was after midnight, so no matter how late it was, I knew I needed to do an enema.

20:08:20&nbsp;
Dave
Very relevant topic for many, even if you only go one time zone and a few hundred miles.

20:08:43&nbsp;
ealincoln
No.  But generally I only use plain water or add peppermint oil.  Then I do a coffee enema and hold for 15 minutes.

20:08:47&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, we use the Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis to test for potassium

20:10:22&nbsp;
Lisa P.
I was too tired to do an enema series, so I needed something strong, so that one enema would work. I used the goatmilk soap. Yes, I did cramp, but this time I couldn't blame it on the soap. It was my condition. Just one, two quart enema did a world of good

20:11:41&nbsp;
kristina
The hair analysis also tests for magnesium, zinc, sodium, calcium, copper and more. I have found it incredibly useful in my practice. In October, I am attending an advanced HTMA seminar through Dr. Janet Lang.

20:11:54&nbsp;
ealincoln
Lisa, what benefit did the goatmilk soap do over plain water, do you think?

20:13:11&nbsp;
ltrail
I'm a person on the fringe of diabetes and monitor blood sugar values with a monitor.  I wish there was such an instrument to test potassium, magnesium, zinc, etc.  lol

20:13:15&nbsp;
Lisa P.
I got very much cleaned out from the goatmilk soap. Nothing else could have done such a good job. After the enema, I was able to sleep well. I guess Kristina can explain it better than I why this soap works so well. All I know it works! 

20:13:20&nbsp;
kristina
When testing for minerals, it is also important to look at the ratios of the minerals to each other. A skilled practitioner knows how to examine the ideal mineral ratios for the healthy individual and how they vary. 

20:14:06&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, that would be fabulous, to have such an instrument available to the individual. 

20:14:32&nbsp;
Lisa P.
I bought the soap back when Kristina still had her goats. Thanks Kristina and her goats!!

20:14:34&nbsp;
kristina
Luckily the lab tests are very affordable. The total cost is $59, which includes the consultation time.

20:14:47&nbsp;
Tim1
What happens if you retain a coffee ennama for more than 15 minutes?

20:14:52&nbsp;
kristina
Okay, travel and bowel function.

20:14:57&nbsp;
Dave
There might be someting good about the traditional 2-quart soapsuds enema, the medical standard in childhood despite popular opinion now.

20:15:33&nbsp;
ealincoln
I don't think anything happens per se after 15 minutes but 15 mins is a minimum

20:15:39&nbsp;
kristina
First of all, if you know that your bowels don't work well while traveling, prepare.

20:16:13&nbsp;
kristina
Starting one to two weeks before you take the trip, start taking a probiotic.

20:16:28&nbsp;
ealincoln
I use it to clean my liver.  I'm receiving chemo therapy and use the coffee to help with nausea and other side effects

20:16:40&nbsp;
kristina
While on the trip, take 1/2 again to double the dosage of probiotic.

20:16:48&nbsp;
kristina
Continue this for at least a week after you arrive home.

20:17:37&nbsp;
ealincoln
Do you recommend a particular probiotic?

20:18:12&nbsp;
kristina
Many probiotics require refrigeration. For this reason, and many others, I have choosen to feature Ortho Biotic.

20:18:42&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Enemas alone work well for me before a big trip. A month before my trip, I try to do an enema once a week. Two weeks before I leave, I do more. I use mostly peppermint and sea salt.

20:18:50&nbsp;
ltrail
Because I usually do a series of enemas about once weekly, I make sure that I have plenty of potassium-supplying foods (bananas, potatoes, orange juice) daily.  I don't know how John Kellogg survived having a daily enema. lol

20:19:16&nbsp;
ealincoln
Do enemas deplete potassium???

20:19:47&nbsp;
kristina
It has been traditionally thought that if a probiotic product was not refrigerated, it was not a good product.  That may be the case for products in the past, however, Ortho Biotic uses a new sealant technology that allows the probiotics to remain viable without refrigeration so that the potency is guaranteed at the time of expiration by manufacturing the product at an overage.  Ortho Biotic guarantees 20 billion cfu?s at the time of expiration (12 months) and Ortho Molecular manufactures the product at 36-37 billion cfu?s to compensate for the slow loss in viability.  This allows more flexibility and confidence when taking the product.  After all, when do people benefit most from taking probiotics?  When they are traveling abroad and many times don?t have the option of refrigerating their product.

20:19:58&nbsp;
ltrail
yes they can because they imitate a runny bowl

20:20:17&nbsp;
kristina
Enemas can deplete potassium.

20:20:43&nbsp;
kristina
They don't necessarily deplete potassium.

20:20:46&nbsp;
Dave
Something with bifudis goes to the colon (lower intestine) where the probiotic is needed most for elimination, I have found.

20:21:18&nbsp;
kristina
For travel, I do recommend that people bring an enema bag.

20:21:20&nbsp;
Tim1
How much liquid can you use for the coffee retention enema?

20:21:53&nbsp;
Lisa P.
I always take a bulb when I travel.

20:22:02&nbsp;
ealincoln
about 1 quart which is 1 cup of enema coffee and 3-4 cups water

20:22:18&nbsp;
ltrail
Once I confessed to a novice doctor that I took enemas and felt better afterward.  The doctor was horrified.  Then said that I should avoid having an enema less than 72 hours frequency.   So I do that.  I since changed doctors also.

20:22:28&nbsp;
kristina
Retaining a coffee enema for longer than fifteen minutes is not harmful to most people.

20:23:13&nbsp;
ealincoln
I have been doing daily enema series w/ coffee at the end every day since starting chemotherapy.  It's the only way I poop!!!  The drugs they give me are very constipating.

20:23:19&nbsp;
kristina
There are no studies on coffee enemas and retention times so it is hard to know what "happens". I think the body will release the coffee solution when it is done with it.

20:23:46&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Kristina, does the coffee just stop working after 15 minutes? That's what I always thought.

20:23:50&nbsp;
kristina
For the coffee enema, I recommend no more than 1 quart of water and coffee mixture.

20:23:53&nbsp;
ealincoln
and I don't want to take MORE drugs in order to have a bowel movement

20:24:04&nbsp;
ltrail
So now, when my doctor has me do blood work every three months for diabetes, my potassium level is also there too.  Haven't had the low level in a long time because I have stretched out my time for enemas to about a week.

20:24:39&nbsp;
Dave
An enema bag while traveling is fine with a partner, maybe a little more complicated if solo and facility not bag-friendly. Certainly a good enema series on return is recommended anyway.

20:24:41&nbsp;
ltrail
and I eat potassium-rich foods

20:25:09&nbsp;
kristina
The other main reason that I have choosen to promote Ortho Biotic, of all the probiotics on the market, is because it contains Saccharomyces boulardii.

20:25:25&nbsp;
kristina
S. boulardii is a brewer's yeast. It has been approved in Germany for the treatment of chronic acne, boils, acute and traveler?s diarrhea

20:25:35&nbsp;
ltrail
Recently my wife and I took a trip to Hungary, Austria, and Switzerland.  The "Cadillac" (silicone 4-qt) went with me.

20:26:06&nbsp;
kristina
S. boulardii stimulates PPAR-gamma expression and reduces response of human colon cells to pro-inflammatory cytokines. Reference: Lee SK, et al. Saccharomyces boulardii activates expression of peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-gamma in HT-29 cells. Korean J Gastroenterol. 2005; 45(5):328-334.

20:26:18&nbsp;
ltrail
I'm sure that baggage handlers had a great time with my bag

20:26:38&nbsp;
kristina
What is a probiotic? Over 300 different strains of bacteria compete for the environment within the lower gastrointestinal tract. Strains that promote health (probiotic), as well as those that cause disturbances compete for space and nutrients. When there is a healthy balance (eubiosis), few symptoms exist. On the other hand, dysbiosis occurs when fewer than normal probiotic organisms and an over abundance of potentially harmful bacteria, yeast or parasitic organisms prevail. Dysbiosis often results in a number of gastrointestinal symptoms.

20:26:38&nbsp;
ealincoln
You should have seen the baggage handlers try to figure out a breast pump!!

20:27:03&nbsp;
Lisa P.
I go the Rick Steves way, and travel very light. That's why I only take the bulb. It works well for me during a trip. I get so cleaned out before I leave!

20:27:09&nbsp;
kristina
DYSBIOSIS:  Events that often trigger dysbiosis include: ? Antiobiotic use ? Foods contaminated with parasites and bacteria ? Abdominal irradiation ? Use of NSAIDs and other drugs ? Foods that lead to gut inflammation

20:27:22&nbsp;
ealincoln
How long should one take a probiotic after having been on an antibiotic?

20:27:26&nbsp;
Dave
Cleaning up: Enema bag with partner while traveling is fine, etc.

20:27:31&nbsp;
kristina
BENEFITS:

20:27:39&nbsp;
kristina
Alters pH environment.

20:27:50&nbsp;
kristina
Active secretion of anti-microbial and anti-yeast components that inhibit non-beneficial organisms.

20:27:59&nbsp;
kristina
increased mucosal immunity

20:28:06&nbsp;
kristina
Increased immune cell phagocytosis

20:28:07&nbsp;
Dave
Multi-bulbs Lisa?

20:28:13&nbsp;
kristina
Increased NK cell activity after ingesting L. rhamnosus

20:28:41&nbsp;
ealincoln
I've been on antibiotics 4 times in 5 months because of immuno compromise from the chemo.  How much probiotic should I take and for how long?

20:28:44&nbsp;
kristina

20:29:13&nbsp;
kristina
Ealincoln

20:29:21&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Yes Dave, I sometimes do three or four bulbs of peppermint & sea salt.

20:29:21&nbsp;
ealincoln
yes?

20:29:47&nbsp;
kristina
It depends on why the person took the antibiotic, what the overall health situation of the person is, the economics of the person and more.

20:30:00&nbsp;
ealincoln
OK

20:30:09&nbsp;
kristina
At this point in my studies, I would say for at least a 3 month period.

20:30:35&nbsp;
ealincoln
OK

20:30:55&nbsp;
kristina
However, one a day for the rest of your life might be a better choice. If you re-read the benefits of probiotics, you can see why.

20:31:07&nbsp;
ealincoln
No argument from me

20:32:36&nbsp;
Dave
That's equal to a quart if you use 8-oz bulb, so good lower cleanout I assume. 

20:32:52&nbsp;
ealincoln
Do you have any suggestion for reducing the cramping when using the goatmilk soap?

20:33:08&nbsp;
kristina
Look for these probiotic strains, Lactobacillus acidophilus: ? Protects human epithelial cells from invasion of E. coli. ? Decreases bacterial enzymes implicated in colon carcinogenesis. ? L. acidophilus, fed by means of a fermented milk product, was shown to increase phagocytic and lymphocytic activity in mice. Lactobacillus paracasei: ? L. acidophilus in combination with L. paracasei reduce diarrheal duration and vomiting in children (6-24 months) suffering from persistent diarrhea .

20:33:10&nbsp;
Tim1
What is the optimum time to retain 4 quarts of epsom salts and water?

20:33:30&nbsp;
kristina
Bifidobacterium bifidum: ? B. bifidum has a high tolerance against stomach acids. ? B. bifidum can effectively inhibit E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Bifidobacterium lactis: ? In an in vitro study, Bifidobacterium strains were able to inhibit gastrointestinal pathogen adhesion on and/or invasion in human intestinal cells. ? Studies show that B. lactis may help prevent allergies in infants.

20:34:02&nbsp;
ltrail
ealincoln:  I think each person's situation is so very different.  Your medicines cause you to have much constipation so I understand your need of daily enemas.  I'm sure that your doctor evaluates your potassium level along with all the other values.

20:34:32&nbsp;
kristina
Lactobacillus plantarum: ? L. plantarum has a protective effect by down regulating IL-8 secretion (a pro-inflammatory cytokine). ? A double-blind placebo controlled study containing 60 people with IBS, showed L. plantarum reduced flatulence and maintained a better overall GI function than in the placebo group. Reference: Danisco. Lactobacillus plantarum Lp-115 probiotic identity card.

20:34:36&nbsp;
ealincoln
Yes.  So far potassium hasn't been a problem.

20:35:09&nbsp;
kristina
Have you tried the chamomile and clary sage goat's milk soap?

20:35:10&nbsp;
ltrail
I've taken enemas on my own since I was 8 years and now 64.  Long, long story

20:35:47&nbsp;
michael b
after hernia surgery, and general anesthesia, i used chamomile and sage soap when i got home in an enema, and everything seems to staighten out, but i took only 5 of the 40 pain pills. i take primal defense probiotic twice a day, that i get from you

20:35:50&nbsp;
ealincoln
I'm not sure which "flavor" of the goatsmilk soap I bought.  :  )

20:36:01&nbsp;
kristina
I don't recommend using epsom salts with an enema but rather a full spectrum of minerals with a sea salt like Celtic Sea salt.

20:36:36&nbsp;
ealincoln
ltrail, you must be an expert enema-ist

20:36:53&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Celtic Sea Salt is what I use. It's expensive, but worth it.

20:36:55&nbsp;
ltrail
Yes, I suppose that I could write a book

20:37:03&nbsp;
ealincoln
I'd read it!

20:37:39&nbsp;
ealincoln
Does the sea salt restore something in the colon or does it stimulate the colon to cleanse or both???

20:37:44&nbsp;
kristina
Both

20:37:51&nbsp;
Tim1
When you dissolve the sea salt in the water what is the stuff that looks like sand that is in the bottom of the glass bowl?

20:38:07&nbsp;
ealincoln
What is the salt to water ratio?

20:38:07&nbsp;
kristina
can you all comment on how long you hold your enema solution?

20:38:25&nbsp;
Vin
Hold it for about 10 minutes

20:38:35&nbsp;
kristina
I usually recommend that the enema solution is taken in to the body slowly so that one can take 2-4 quarts of water.

20:38:42&nbsp;
Lisa P.
I try 10 minutes.

20:38:47&nbsp;
ltrail
In a nut shell, I have other needs that are not met.  I had a mother with MS, a nurse, but she felt her disease might be contagious and did not provide close personal bonding and attention.  Later, because of MS, she couldn't.  So I yearn for nurturing.

20:39:15&nbsp;
ltrail
A nurse's administration of an enema is such a fulfillment

20:39:17&nbsp;
kristina
Once the solution is in the body, I recommend that you sit on the toilet and release. This process usually takes 5-15 minutes.

20:39:47&nbsp;
ealincoln
No matter how slowly I do my enema, I can't get more than 2 quarts of water in.

20:40:12&nbsp;
Vin
Kristina, what is your recommendation on holding a solution?  Does it vary on the solution?

20:41:07&nbsp;
Lisa P.
I guess it depends if it's an implant or a cleansing enema.

20:41:26&nbsp;
Vin
Cleansing

20:41:34&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, it does vary.

20:41:46&nbsp;
kristina
Have you tried the sea salt, ealincoln?

20:41:59&nbsp;
Dave
Many were given first enemas in our "vintage," but did not re-discover until needs years later reintroduced them, ltrail. All very valid medical reasons.

20:42:10&nbsp;
Vin
elaborate if you would please.

20:42:29&nbsp;
ealincoln
No, not yet.  

20:42:44&nbsp;
kristina
Have you viewed the downloadable movies, Large Volume and Small Volume Enemas?

20:42:55&nbsp;
ealincoln
Yes, I downloaded them both.

20:43:30&nbsp;
kristina
The sea salt almost always assists a person to take more enema solution more easily.

20:43:39&nbsp;
ealincoln
It looks like I'm doing everything correctly.

20:43:52&nbsp;
Lisa P.
If it's a cleansing enema with peppermint and seasalt, I can hold it longer. About 10 to 15 minutes. If soap, no more than 10 minutes.

20:43:52&nbsp;
ealincoln
OK.  I'll try.  What is the water/salt ratio?

20:44:01&nbsp;
kristina
Do you take no more than 1/2 cup of enema solution into your body?

20:44:24&nbsp;
Tim1
How much sea salt per quart of water?

20:44:28&nbsp;
kristina
The ratio can vary. Start with 1 teaspoon of salt for each quart of water. You may need more and you may need less.

20:44:36&nbsp;
ealincoln
OK

20:44:57&nbsp;
michael b
trail, i have a sister who has had MS FOR 19 YEARS, it is not contagious. the most common seems to be stress. 

20:45:23&nbsp;
Vin
Thanks Lisa P.  I would imagine the quantity of water in the colon will make a difference on the retention.

20:46:16&nbsp;
Lisa P.
I'm more comfortable with holding two quarts. No more than that if I'm holding it.

20:46:21&nbsp;
kristina
have i missed any questions or threads?

20:46:25&nbsp;
Vin
Typical quantity for me is 2 to 3 quarts

20:47:08&nbsp;
Tim1
What is the sand looking stuff after you dissolve the sea salt?

20:47:40&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Yes Kristina. Can you tell us why the goatmilk soap helped me so much? Why does it work better than anything else?

20:48:26&nbsp;
kristina
Truthfully, I have never noted that there is a white sand-like substance in the enema bag after using the sea salt. Anyone else noted this?

20:48:31&nbsp;
Dave
Lisa, assume cup or so and little rest is best recipe or you for good hold of a full bag? 

20:49:20&nbsp;
Lisa P.
I thought this would make a good plug for selling your soap. It really does work well when you are feeling sick like I was.

20:49:20&nbsp;
kristina
 Nothing is taken out of the Celtic Sea Salt. however Celtic Sea Salt is carefully sifted through to remove natural debris such as small stones or sand. More than 80 vital minerals are left intact!

20:49:55&nbsp;
Vin
Kristina-why does your latest soap from goats milk seem to go in well but cramping occurs more often than other soaps?

20:51:01&nbsp;
Lisa P.
It was worth going through the cramping, because after the enema, I felt so much better!

20:51:27&nbsp;
Dave
Who know what was in the Ivory swished in enema cans and bags, lol. 

20:51:30&nbsp;
Vin
Agree Lisa, but you would expect the opposite

20:52:05&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Kristina, does cramping mean that we are getting rid of more toxins??

20:52:26&nbsp;
michael b
kristina, I was told not take Ortho mega called a blood thinner. I have seen the sand spoken of, i thought that was part of the 80 minerals?

20:53:03&nbsp;
kristina
I have written extensively about how cramping can be an important part of the cleansing process.

20:53:26&nbsp;
Vin
Which doc should I read?

20:53:35&nbsp;
Dave
Breathe thru the cramps?

20:53:41&nbsp;
kristina
There is a doctor in England who insists that cramping is essential to remove the toxins of modern living like asbestos.

20:53:53&nbsp;
Vin
OK

20:53:54&nbsp;
Lisa P.
Oh, by the way, I never have seen the salt at the bottom of the bag. I shake it up well before putting it in the bag.

20:54:13&nbsp;
kristina
Because there are no studies detailing what comes out of the colon with a colon cleanse, it is hard to say for certain.

20:54:21&nbsp;
Vin
Shaking or stirring gets rid of the residue

20:54:38&nbsp;
kristina
Certainly, most people do not prefer to cramp during their colon cleanse treatment.

20:55:04&nbsp;
kristina
I have written it up on my website. Send me an email and I will direct you to the written materials.

20:55:27&nbsp;
kristina
Next live chat: October 8th at 7 pm.

20:55:27&nbsp;
Vin
Thanks.  Have to sign off.  Good discussion.

20:55:46&nbsp;
kristina
I do so appreciate all of you who shared an hour of their evenings here.
