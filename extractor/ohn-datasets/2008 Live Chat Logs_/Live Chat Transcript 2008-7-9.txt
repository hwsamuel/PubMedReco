Hi

19:53:55&nbsp;
Lisa
Hi Kris! Gosh, I've been as busy as you are these days! Nice to take this break to be a part of this chat.

19:54:08&nbsp;
Lisa
Hi Dave!!

19:54:13&nbsp;
Dave
You there kris? how did IACT in Vegas go, or what happened in Vegas stayed in Vegas, as the motto goes LOL.

19:54:58&nbsp;
Dave
Good to get back on the chat.

19:55:09&nbsp;
kristina
Hi to both of you. I am very pleased to see both of you here at the chat

19:55:26&nbsp;
kristina
Las Vegas and the I-ACT convention was excellent. 

19:55:40&nbsp;
kristina
DeeDee and I are now both board certified colon hydrotherapists.

19:56:03&nbsp;
kristina
I also got to take in a Cirque Du Soleil show, which I just loved.

19:56:24&nbsp;
Dave
Make a presentation there, or mostly to listen and learn?

19:56:28&nbsp;
Lisa
I thought you were already board certified!!

19:57:33&nbsp;
Lisa
Sorry Dave I didn't get back to your emails. I haven't been at the computer much.

19:58:13&nbsp;
kristina
Welcome to Michael.

19:58:38&nbsp;
Dave
Now they're blaming peppers as posible culprit for the botulism epidemic. Guess nothing's safe.

19:59:01&nbsp;
kristina
Welcome to Knudson and John.

19:59:22&nbsp;
kristina
Dave, can you tell me more about this botulism epidemic. I have not kept up with it.

19:59:29&nbsp;
michael b
hello everyone,i hope summer is starting out just fine for all.

19:59:41&nbsp;
kristina
Hello Mike!

19:59:49&nbsp;
Mike K
Hi

20:01:03&nbsp;
Dave
It's the one that started a few weeks ago with tomatoes from FL or Mexico suspected. Now it's other foods, and 1,000 cases reported. Carol here said she had it.

20:01:48&nbsp;
nibroc
WELCOME ALL

20:01:55&nbsp;
kristina
Thank you. Welcome to you.

20:02:06&nbsp;
Lisa
I hope Carole will join us today, to let us know how she's feeling!

20:02:22&nbsp;
nibroc
WHAT IS OUR FIRST TOPIC

20:02:32&nbsp;
kristina
Please do go ahead with your questions, comments, concerns or stories related to health, the colon cleanse, enema equipment, supplements, your health program and more.

20:03:02&nbsp;
kristina
We welcome anyone to start a topic. I will start my topics also.

20:03:43&nbsp;
nibroc
Go ahead--you mentioned a new video last month-0-what are your feelings for a topic an the format

20:03:47&nbsp;
kristina
I am wondering how folks are doing with our new website?

20:04:20&nbsp;
Lisa
I'm doing just fine with the new website. It's beautiful!!

20:04:44&nbsp;
nibroc
I like the format and the layout--but why the silence amont =g the group?????

20:05:07&nbsp;
Dave
I had sedated dental surgery week ago, and antibiotics have done the usual job on GI tract. Are probiotics recommended to help with this while on antibiotics?

20:05:34&nbsp;
kristina
New videos won't be happening until the fall. We are looking into making a number of videos and welcome topics. A few topics we are considering are using a colon board, using retention nozzles, enemas and the later stages in life.

20:05:49&nbsp;
Lisa
I'm sorry to hear about that Dave! I hope you are recovering well!

20:05:57&nbsp;
guy
you do a good job with all your videos

20:06:16&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, Dave, I recommend that you start taking probiotics immediately and continue for a period of 3 months. Please call DeeDee to talk about the probiotic we would recommend for you. 

20:06:28&nbsp;
Dave
I'll survive, and thanx lisa.

20:06:49&nbsp;
kristina
Ortho Biotic is a probiotic formula that contains Saccharomyces boulardii, a proven potentiator for good bacteria that removes pathogens from the gut and enables a more effective probiotic presence while encouraging a healthy environment for vitamin uptake and immune support.

20:08:48&nbsp;
nibroc
Getting well always had its side effects

20:09:10&nbsp;
michael b
and hi to you Kristina, the state of California has over 300 forest fires raging all over the place, the air where I live is really smokey... do you have any suggestions to maintain good health in this "CHINA" like atmosphere?

20:09:54&nbsp;
Lisa
I'm under much stress. Besides having my own business, I'm taking over my son's business too! It's endless hours! I need to take more time to take care of myself. Now I feel we're in the same boat Kristina!!

20:10:12&nbsp;
kristina
When indoors, I recommend having an air conditioner running. I would also have a high-quality air filter running in  the home.

20:10:24&nbsp;
Dave
 Constipation seems to be a well-known side to antibiotics too.

20:10:39&nbsp;
Mike K
michael b I went through the ones down South last year and you really should get a gas mask. that government is handing them out for free

20:10:50&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, constipation can be a side effect of antibiotics.

20:11:15&nbsp;
Lisa
I agree Kris. The cheap filters are bad. I get the best since we run the AC on all the time in the Texas heat!

20:11:19&nbsp;
kristina
That is a hard one, Michael. Where do you live?

20:11:20&nbsp;
guy
most antibiotics increase acidity in the body

20:11:21&nbsp;
nibroc
Sorry about the pollutions---and I hope your property is not endangered---Before air conditioning--on the farm--we hung wet towels around the house to absorb dust and smoke--it does work  but modern AC is better

20:11:42&nbsp;
kristina
Also, a regular colon cleanse program will help, too. I would use coffee enemas.

20:12:20&nbsp;
knudson
kristina how often can i safely use coffee enemas?

20:13:09&nbsp;
nibroc
Also--- the 3m Filtrete air filter is much more effective than fiberglass---and this is from the guys that made them---although the modern ads are grossly overstated

20:13:20&nbsp;
knudson
kristina - should i use them with my colema board or with an enema bag - 15 minutes retention time, right?

20:14:42&nbsp;
nibroc
How did we get from air filters of coffee??

20:14:59&nbsp;
michael b
sparks, nevada, 449 miles north of las vegas, next to reno, las vegas was 112 deg.

20:15:10&nbsp;
kristina
How often you can safely use coffee enemas depends on the individual. With that said, cancer patients are being recommended to take 2-3 coffee enemas daily. If one isn't dealing with cancer, I think once a week is optimal for most unless you are working through a cleansing program or a program of detoxification like the 35-day colon cleanse program that is laid out in my book, Ten Days to Optimal Health, and our Vit-Ra-Tox Kit.

20:15:26&nbsp;
guy
kristina recommended coffee enemas to michael b

20:15:56&nbsp;
Dave
I've had pint+ of coffee (full strength) with 15-minute hold and seems to work.  

20:16:06&nbsp;
kristina
Michael, I always get confused that you are Michael B because of the b. Thank you so very much for the gift that you gave to DeeDee and me for our trip to the International Association of Colon Hydrotherapy convention.

20:16:29&nbsp;
John B
Have you ever heard of using L-glutamine for healing inflammation of the stomach and intestinal tract? I found out about this recently and some texts I have mention it.  I am using  1/2 tsp. (2.5 gm) 4x/day--seems like less mucous at cleanout enemas.

20:18:49&nbsp;
kristina
Great, Dave on the coffee enema treatment.

20:20:08&nbsp;
Dave
Naturally, a "normal" enema to clean out is better first, correct?

20:21:07&nbsp;
nibroc
Kristina---ref coffee enemas---your video states the recipe as 2oz of cold coffee to a quart of water and retain for 1015 min---I'm a first timer and would like the group opinion for a recipe---ahtns all

20:21:24&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, L glutamine is an amino acid that helps to heal the gut.

20:22:50&nbsp;
michael b
Kristina, you and Dee Dee are most welcome, hope you had a great dinner.

20:24:54&nbsp;
Dave
Noticed that new board says archives or past chats (after May 07) wil be posted. Any ETA?

20:28:06&nbsp;
John B
guy, if the alkalinity question was for me, I have been trying all sorts of things for about 4 years.  Juicing, baking soda, Buffer-pH+, etc., but nothing seems to do the trick even when staying on a primarily alkaline food diet.

20:29:08&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, clearing out the entire colon before you take the coffee enema is more beneficial to the body than just taking a coffee enema without clearing out the colon first.

20:29:45&nbsp;
kristina
I do not have an ETA on the old archives and chats. However, my goal is before the August live chat.

20:30:17&nbsp;
kristina
John, what results are you looking for that "nothing seems to be doing the trick"?

20:30:50&nbsp;
Dave
Fine, some of us have some catching up to do, lol.

20:31:59&nbsp;
kristina
Those old colon health chats and newsletters will add a lot of very useful information to our site. The are rich in colon cleanse technique, enema equipment suggestions, useful supplements and more.

20:34:04&nbsp;
kristina
John, we offer L-glutamine in two forms in our store.

20:34:28&nbsp;
kristina
L-Glutamine is the most abundant free amino acid found in the muscles of the body. It assists in maintaining the proper acid/alkaline balance in the body, and is the basis of the building blocks for the synthesis of RNA and DNA. It is an essential component to maintaining a healthy gut wall. It is the best supplement for eliminating chronic diarrhea. Glutamine has been used clinically for the treatment of ulcers.

20:34:49&nbsp;
kristina
Mucosagen is a unique formula designed for support of the intestinal lining. Mucosagen is indicated for leaky gut syndrome (a problem commonly seen with food allergies), colitis, Candida, chronic diarrhea and gastro-intestinal conditions. Mucosagen is intended to reduce inflammation, free radical load and histamine, and to support the liver while soothing and repairing the intestinal lining which has been damaged by food allergies, intestinal permeability, parasitic infections, inflammatory bowel disease, Krohn's disease or leaky gut syndrome.

20:34:54&nbsp;
Dave
Lots of other sites are lacking in real-world experiences, and true ones, so archives should be helpful to many.

20:36:55&nbsp;
John B
Kristina, most naturapaths say that the urine pH should stay in the 6.5 to 7.0, some even say to get it up to 7.2.  I am pretty consistently around 6.5; I can get it higher if I take supplements all the time.

20:36:58&nbsp;
kristina
Here are some of the speakers that were at the I-ACT convention:

20:37:00&nbsp;
kristina
Colin Tipping, "Cleansing the Emotional Body through Radical Forgiveness"

20:37:11&nbsp;
kristina

20:38:08&nbsp;
kristina
Dr. Margolis, "The Tooth & Gut Connection"

20:39:58&nbsp;
Dave
Any chance there to discuss your/Dee Dee's  enema alternative program to gauge interest?

20:41:04&nbsp;
michael b
Kristina, i add the 'b' because there are so many michaels and mikes,it looks like the trip to las vegas was GREAT. 

20:41:20&nbsp;
Lisa
It sure would be nice if DeeDee can join this chat sometimes. She's wonderful!!

20:41:23&nbsp;
nibroc
Dave--what is this

20:41:24&nbsp;
kristina
I know that testing of urine and saliva is a marker of  how daily living/nutrition patterns affect functioning of the body to either enhance or diminish health.

20:41:47&nbsp;
kristina
Urine/saliva testing of this type was first used by Dr. Carey Reams early in this century.

20:43:49&nbsp;
kristina
We are building the interest. The difficulty is that we are encouraging colon hydrotherapists to recommend enema equipment. There are many politics involved with FDA-approved equipment for the colon cleanse. Numerous people on the board do want to see me speak about my work at future conventions.

20:45:28&nbsp;
kristina
I would recommend you take Vita Gest to shift your entire body pH to be more alkaline. It is basically a pharmaceutical grade of baking soda. Here is more on the product:

20:45:30&nbsp;
kristina
The first major phase of digestion takes place in the stomach where hydrochloric acid acts upon undigested protein to split it into polypeptides. The polypeptides are then acted upon by pepsin and later, in the duodenum by proteolytic enzymes. The stomach's normal acidity is a pH of approximately 1. It must be 2 or lower in order for pepsin to activate. While the stomach is acid, protected by a thick layer of mucous, the small intestine is neutral, or slightly alkaline. Hydrochloric acid is necessary in adequate quantity for protein to digest, and more importantly, is very protective against parasites. Most parasites cannot tolerate an extremely low pH provided by hydrochloric acid.  The next stage of digestion is in the small intestine. The food mixed with acid starts arriving in the small intestine 20-30 minutes after eating. Here it must be neutralized so pancreatic enzymes are triggered and can carry out the remaining protein digestion and that of carbohydrates and fats. A healthy body neutralizes the acid.  A problem for many individuals, however, is that they don't have the alkaline reserve to neutralize the acid as it empties through the pylorus into the duodenum. Digestion is therefore inadequate and the person becomes poorly nourished while scavenger organisms in the colon are overfed. In those who do not neutralize the acid, taking VITA GEST at least thrity minutes after a meal will allow time for the acid to do its work prior to neutralizing it.  The pancreatic enzymes which enter the small intestine function best in a neutral-to-slightly alkaline pH, and VITA GEST therefore assists the remaining digestive process. The alkaline buffering response also allows the body to build alkaline reserve to impact acid-body systems.  The liver needs these bicarbonates to filter through acidic toxins. If it is deficient, toxins backup into the lymphatics and other tissues causing symptoms and ultimately disease.  Take VITA GEST 20-30 minutes after a meal or as directed by your practitioner. It supplies potassium and sodium in proportions directly related to those of the bicarbonates secreted by the body when it is functioning well.

20:47:09&nbsp;
Dave
I can see where FDA and politics are problems and some states have really hindered machine hydrotherapy. Lisa, Texas could use a lot of enema clinics as replacements, right?? 

20:47:35&nbsp;
kristina
1 capsule contains 99 mg Potassium (Bicarbonate), 99 mg Sodium (Bicarbonate), 20 mg Potassium Citrate

20:47:48&nbsp;
kristina
Natural gelatin capsules, magnesium stearate, Microcrystalline Cellulose.  Contains no wheat, soy, dairy, yeast, sugar, artificial flavorings, colorings, or additives.

20:48:03&nbsp;
Lisa
You're right about that Dave!

20:49:17&nbsp;
Dave
Not that Texans may need enemas more than others, but still ... LOL.

20:49:35&nbsp;
michael b
Kristina,your #1 tip, eating every 2 or 2.5 hours won't be easy, but is worth a try. 

20:50:07&nbsp;
kristina
Have you tried it yet, Michael? Remember that you don't need to eat much in each one of those sittings. 

20:50:35&nbsp;
kristina
that you might even end up eating less food than if you eat the 3 square meals a day.

20:50:38&nbsp;
Lisa
Dave, Texans do need Texas sized enemas however! LOL!

20:50:56&nbsp;
kristina
Also, the emphasis on breakfast is so key. 

20:51:45&nbsp;
kristina
Just this morning, a mom and daughter that I didn't know saw me eating sardines for breakfast. The mom laughed and said, "you are eating sardines for breakfast? Now I won't feel so bad about eating tuna for breakfast."

20:52:32&nbsp;
kristina
As they were walking past me as I entered my office building this morning, the daughter had a lovely sneer on her face!

20:52:58&nbsp;
Lisa
That makes sense to me Kris. That's a great food value to start off the day!

20:53:11&nbsp;
kristina
Does anyone have any questions or experiences they would like to share before we shut down the live chat in the next little bit?

20:53:34&nbsp;
Dave
McDonald's in my parts is offering chicken  and biscuits for breakfast. New to me.

20:53:44&nbsp;
kristina
Our next Live Chat will be on Wednesday, August 13th at 7pm. 

20:54:16&nbsp;
John B
Kristina or others, Bill Henderson, a cancer guru, author of Beating-Cancer-Gently, says to take cottage cheese and flax seed oil for Dr. Budwig's.  What about mucous from cottage cheese?

20:54:20&nbsp;
kristina
Easy, too. I had sardines, papaya and grilled zucchini for breakfast. It was lovely.

20:54:42&nbsp;
Lisa
Sorry I didn't have anything to offer on this chat, but I did learn a lot.

20:55:01&nbsp;
kristina
Well, I agree that pastuerized dairy is not the best food for a cancer patient. Maybe raw cottage cheese?

20:55:43&nbsp;
kristina
However, over the past few months I had been one of many health practitioners on a team of people who was working with a man with liver cancer. He used that exact diet. He died. It was tragic.

20:56:01&nbsp;
michael b
I realize i must get back to the soup from bones.if you could have the kid,the old peanut and jelly fish sandwich.

20:56:33&nbsp;
kristina
This doesn't mean the diet won't work for some.

20:56:45&nbsp;
John B
The cottage cheese I have been using is pastuerized but has live cultures and enzymes added.

20:57:50&nbsp;
kristina
My recommendations for recovering from cancer are foods like raw liver, coconut oil, vegetable juices.

20:58:30&nbsp;
kristina
The raw cottage cheese would more likely be a therapeutic food 

20:59:21&nbsp;
kristina
Of course, I would also recommend herbs like Cat's Claw, Ashwaganda, Burdock root and more.

20:59:41&nbsp;
John B
I have tried sheep liver from a local producer that doesn't use antibiotics or hormones, but I quit over concern for purity.

21:00:09&nbsp;
michael b
the time goes so fast, glad so many people made it to the chat,

21:00:11&nbsp;
kristina
And, digestive enzymes in large quantities and probiotics. I would also check adrenal health, gut immunity, for parasites, and candida.

21:00:56&nbsp;
John B
Thanks.  Been there, done that, and still doing it.

21:01:04&nbsp;
kristina
yes, it is hard to find liver that would be as clean as you might ideally want it but I wouldn't throw it out as a therapeutic food.

21:01:12&nbsp;
kristina
Do you have cancer?

21:01:54&nbsp;
Dave
Good you made time her, Lisa. amd take time for your own needs.

21:02:16&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, Lisa, do take good, sweet care of yourself.

21:02:22&nbsp;
John B
Prostate cancer - dealing with naturally since 1999.  Right kidney removed the maglinant tumor in 2003.  Doing good, just need to do better.

21:02:25&nbsp;
Lisa
I'll try Dave! Thanx for caring!

21:02:53&nbsp;
Lisa
Thank you Kris!

21:03:12&nbsp;
Dave
Nighty nite.

21:03:19&nbsp;
kristina
Well done, John! Do keep in touch. Have you tried our frankicense and myrhh soap with your enemas?

21:03:54&nbsp;
kristina
Good Night to all.

21:03:59&nbsp;
guy
good night

21:04:07&nbsp;
guy
thanks for the nice chat

21:04:07&nbsp;
Lisa
Keep doing welk John, and keep the positive thinking!!

21:04:20&nbsp;
guy
you really have a very nice web site

21:04:36&nbsp;
Lisa
I meant doing well. Typo!

21:04:47&nbsp;
michael b
and so guy says you recomend coffee enemas for me, that's healthy.

21:05:12&nbsp;
guy
coffee enemas SEEM TO BE extremely beneficial for cancer patients, yes

21:09:38&nbsp;
guy
did you know that about 46% of the medical docs have now admitted in writing that they abuse their own prescribing power to get "drugs" for themselves?

21:13:50&nbsp;
michael b
guy, john b -- kristina is most amazing, i don't see how she does so much.

21:14:06&nbsp;
guy
exactly

21:14:15&nbsp;
guy
a brilliant lady, and a caring professional

21:14:27&nbsp;
guy
I live and work in South Carolina, and enema therapy is rare here

21:14:36&nbsp;
guy
unlike where I was raised in Chicago

21:15:21&nbsp;
guy
I have found that, at age 57+ I am "more healthy" than I have been in years, FROM frequent enema administration

21:15:38&nbsp;
guy
are you guys actively using enema therapy, per kristina's advice?

21:19:17&nbsp;
michael b
guy, i ran across kristina on the computer, and was concerned about toxins and sent in a hair sample.

21:19:40&nbsp;
guy
oh yes

21:19:45&nbsp;
guy
that FASCINATES ME

21:19:50&nbsp;
guy
how did that go?

21:22:20&nbsp;
michael b
the hair sample showed an acute sodium lack, leading to possible thyroid failure.

21:22:37&nbsp;
guy
hmmmmm

21:22:42&nbsp;
guy
were you able to ACT on that?

21:24:27&nbsp;
michael b
i began changing my diet, big time, mostly not eating this and not eating that.

21:27:27&nbsp;
guy
I see

21:27:37&nbsp;
guy
how does the enema therapy fit in with what you are doing?

21:29:35&nbsp;
michael b
i then started listening to kristina about colon health and ordered her book

21:32:00&nbsp;
michael b
good night all
