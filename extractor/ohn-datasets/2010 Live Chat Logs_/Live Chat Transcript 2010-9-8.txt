well hello there. hope all is well with you and your family.

20:02:08
kristina
Thank you, Michael. Things are great. My son is off to college in North Carolina. I miss him but he is having a fabulous time. My daughter continues to study piano. Life is good. How are you?

20:02:17
kristina
Welcome, Scott. How are things with you?

20:02:48
kristina
Let me know if either of you have any questions or issues on your mind. 

20:03:23
kristina
I thought we might talk about supporting the body through this fall season and preparing for winter.

20:03:40
ScottW
Things are quite well, thank you, Kris.  The heat of middle Tennessee has broken a bit (under 100 with heat index) and I'm finely able to get outside a bit again.

20:05:15
kristina
I had no idea it was so hot in TN. The weather in WI has been more like deep fall.

20:05:29
michael b
i'm sad to see all of the flooding in guatemala.

20:05:40
kristina
Me too!

20:05:43
ScottW
Want to change houses for a month or so?

20:06:29
michael b
you wanna try pakistan?

20:08:00
kristina
I do like the heat!

20:08:44
michael b
like thomas harris said, Mother Nature is not cruel, but indifferent.

20:08:50
kristina
Michael, since there are hardly any folks here tonight, would you be willing to share your story?

20:08:57
kristina
As well as you, Scott?

20:09:01
ScottW
With the weather patterns as they've been for the past several years, I would guess that Central America and southern Mexico are in for an extended period of just this type of weather.  In my area here, we went from highs in the upper nineties/low 100's to the mid 70's in two days.  That's movement.

20:09:03
kristina
Why do you use enemas? 

20:09:09
kristina
How often do you use enemas?

20:09:26
kristina
How has the Optimal Health Network/Center helped you improve your health?

20:09:33
kristina
What do you think about our enema products?

20:09:39
kristina
How are the supplements that we offer?

20:09:45
kristina
How is our customer service?

20:09:50
ScottW
Well, I'm old enough to remember when enemas were considered a basic health tool. Received them often as a little guy. 

20:11:10
ScottW
Now I mainly use them to rid myself of bloating which seems to more regularly visit me in my advancing years.

20:12:54
kristina
You, Michael?

20:15:03
kristina
Back to supporting oneself though the fall into the winter for excellent allergy-free and flu-free health. Take Echinacea Premium, a MediHerb product daily.

20:15:19
michael b
well, I have been following the change you outlined in diet and colon cleansing  [enemas] and am still most amazed at the welcomed improvements in so many ways. 

20:15:42
kristina
Echinacea Permium is an ideal long-term support to help maintain a healthy immune system. 

20:16:18
kristina
Research shows that the alkylamides are the most important compounds for activating the immune system, thereby helping it to maintain a healthy status.

20:16:21
ScottW
As to how often I use them, the simple answer is it varies. My system has changed dramatically in the past three years, and I'm trying to figure out its new cycles.  I was used to a great sense of order, and that seems to have left. :)

20:17:12
kristina
And the reason to use MediHerb Echinacea Premium is because they guarantee a minimum of 4.1 mg of alkylamides in every tablet and 1.5 mg in each 1mL of Echinacea Permium 1:2 extract.

20:17:38
kristina
Did either of you find interest in the August newsletter?

20:17:43
kristina
I wrote about men's health.

20:17:57
michael b
are you talking about pills, liquids, or foods?

20:18:14
kristina
One can use tablets or liquid.

20:18:48
kristina
Michael, not to pick on you, but I know you have been with us a long, long time so I think there are so many, many people who would benefit from hearing just a few more details of your story.

20:19:05
ScottW
You've caught me out of that one, Kris.  It's in my to-do reading, but haven't quite got to it yet!

20:19:48
kristina
Well, Scott, let me know what you think. There are a lot of very unique tools listed in the article for men to use to optimize their health.

20:19:57
kristina
Certainly the regular enema is one of them.

20:22:16
ScottW
I've been madly trying to get the other computer onto my email to get the article while we're all still together.

20:23:36
kristina
To learn more about echinacea, go here.

20:23:59
kristina
Welcome Debbie!

20:24:13
Debbie
Hello Kristina

20:24:45
michael b
the writing about men's health is great. i'm seeing people i  used to work with dying, mostly heavy cigerette users. it has been sad. i'm so glad your mom has stopped.

20:24:47
kristina
Welcome, Bob.

20:24:48
Debbie
Since it appears we are alone, I will ask what causes the rectum to itch.

20:25:18
ScottW
Oh, I remember the article now.  I've been engaged in an exercise program for some time now to lose about 50 pounds.  I retired a year ago this month (hoorah) and the relaxation portion took over too quickly.  The exercise is also planned to lower my BP.

20:25:23
kristina
Thank you, Michael. And, I am so sorry about those loving men dying prematurely. 

20:26:26
michael b
debbie, you are not alone - just slow typers.

20:26:43
Debbie
okay the question still stands

20:28:08
michael b
could the answer be leaking, ever so slightly? 

20:28:46
ScottW
The enema portion of your question is about monthly.  It seems to offer more of an &quot;inside out&quot; massage that really relaxes.

20:29:39
Debbie
Is anyone there?

20:30:12
ScottW
Hi, Deb. We're still here.  Seems to be a long lag time tonight.

20:31:29
kristina
sorry, technical difficulties.

20:32:02
kristina
Hemorrhoids, bacteria, stool

20:32:10
kristina
anal tearing

20:32:35
Debbie
No hemorrhoids and stools are like pond muck at times

20:33:02
kristina
diet

20:33:06
kristina
sweating

20:33:15
kristina
diabetes

20:33:24
kristina
recent antibiotic use

20:33:34
Debbie
none of the above

20:33:47
kristina
perfume, soap, dye in one's soap

20:33:52
Debbie
good diet from my garden and your biotics

20:34:02
Debbie
I wash with castile soap

20:34:09
michael b
Kristina, I would never have thought enemas could make the whole body feel so much better all over. I would never guessed such.

20:34:28
kristina
caffeine, chocolate, beer, nuts, dairy products, spicy foods

20:34:37
Debbie
Still nothing

20:34:41
kristina
cancer, in rare cases

20:35:14
Debbie
My pancreas is hurting, but no cancer thoughts

20:35:19
kristina
pinworm, yeast, genital warts

20:35:34
Debbie
no genital warts ever

20:35:52
kristina
I would use Super Salve from us and if this doesn't work then I would use our stool analysis.

20:36:01
Debbie
okay, if it is pinworm or yeast, then what?

20:36:18
Debbie
I do use your super salve

20:37:18
michael b
debbie, do you have a dull and boring diet?

20:37:46
Debbie
Can coffee enemas take the minerals out and cause severe leg and foot cramps?

20:38:01
Debbie
My diet may be boring but it is varied.

20:38:42
kristina
the Super Salve hasn't stopped the itching? how long has it been going on? Does it hurt?

20:38:51
michael b
and you made it to the chat.

20:38:54
kristina
Do you have any other symptoms of ill health?

20:39:01
kristina
Might you have diabetes? D

20:39:10
Debbie
It does not hurt just a lot of itching and I notice it most while sleeping.

20:39:11
kristina
How much sugary stuff do you eat?

20:39:29
Debbie
Very little sugar this summer mostly vegetables from garden

20:39:55
kristina
Most parasites, like pinworm, tend to be more active at night.

20:40:44
Debbie
My health stinks. I go from one specialist to the next. Can't focus or stay awake in daytime. My body fuctions shut down. No one knows what is wrong.

20:40:58
kristina
pinworm itches more at night because that is when the female worms are most active and crawl out of the anus to deposit their eggs.

20:41:01
Debbie
If pinworms then what??? PLEASE

20:41:23
kristina
There are more than 40 million cases of pinworm in the US alone each year.

20:41:39
Debbie
Okay but that is not a solution.

20:42:09
kristina
Do you have someone in the house with you?

20:42:18
Debbie
Not at the moment.

20:42:40
kristina
Pinworm can be seen with a flashlight at night when it itches.

20:43:03
Debbie
Okay so when I itch I should get out a flash light??

20:43:20
michael b
no pets?

20:43:35
kristina
You can also use scotch tape on a tongue depressor or a popsiscle stick to &quot;catch&quot; the pinworm

20:43:44
Debbie
If so then what can I do? I think I have been out of balance for a long time. Even if I eat well.

20:44:05
Debbie
A bunny in a cage, but this was before her.

20:44:31
kristina
daily enemas have been known to flush out pinworm.

20:45:02
Debbie
If they deposit their eggs where do they do this? On the sheets? And I do enemas every day.

20:46:02
kristina
Take a look at our services. We would tend to start you off with a Hair Analysis and an Adrenal Stress Index Test.

20:46:24
Debbie
I have done that.

20:46:42
kristina
Enemas daily...yes.

20:46:45
michael b
what if you have a strong beer or two before bed? this is no joke.

20:46:48
Debbie
Yes.

20:47:06
Debbie
No beer, but red wine would be nice.

20:47:11
kristina
Eggs on the anal area... yes, all the sheets need to be cleaned.

20:47:27
Debbie
How would I know?

20:47:42
kristina
see them

20:48:00
kristina
otherwise, you can take albendazole or mebendazole for the pinworms.

20:48:07
Debbie
I have never seen anything. Maybe I don't know what to look for, or it is something else?

20:48:19
Debbie
Where do I get that from?

20:48:28
kristina
launder all bedding and clothing to destroy any eggs every 3-7 days for three weeks

20:48:40
kristina
wash underwear and pajamas daily for two weeks

20:49:48
kristina
you need someone else to look or try to &quot;catch&quot; them with the tape or the eggs so that you can get it tested.

20:50:08
Debbie
I HAVE NO ONE

20:50:12
kristina
You would need to go to doctor if you don't see them and want to test for them and to get pharmaceuticals

20:51:13
michael b
would this be in a stool sample?

20:51:25
kristina
A natural antibiotic that can kill pinworm is Grapefruit Seed Extract.

20:51:28
kristina
We do carry that.

20:51:43
Debbie
How would that be taken because I do have that.

20:51:44
kristina
This is what I would try first, along with the daily enema.

20:51:55
kristina
Take 2-3 drops, 3-4 times daily.

20:52:07
kristina
Put in juice or coconut milk or rice milk.

20:52:44
Debbie
Alright, any implant of it

20:55:35
kristina
not heard of that. Use it orally first and then let me know.

20:56:12
Robbie
what should she use in the enema?

20:56:36
kristina
Ok, next live chat September 22nd at noon.

20:56:40
Debbie
thank you - I am going to do my coffee now. I will call you - thanks everyone!

20:56:49
kristina
you are so very welcome.

20:56:49
Dan B
I noticed you have a new protocol for the coffee enema.  I have been doing them for probably 3 years from one a week to once a month.  Is the new protocol more effective?

20:57:08
kristina
Yes, the new protocol is very effective.

20:57:26
kristina
I need to sign off now. I hope to hear from you all soon. Thanks so much for coming.

20:58:00
ScottW
Thank you, Kris.  Have a good evening.  Bye, all.

20:58:06
michael b
give arlo our best.
