Hi Scott, just you and I for now. I will begin to start some threads of alternative health discussion. You can go ahead with what is on your mind at any time.

20:03:57
ScottW
Well, Kris, I'm still drying out.  I live directly in the area that flooded so badly in Nashville, TN, last week.  I'm on a hill and was saved the most from the water but the roads are all washed out.  Makes for some quiet days.  How's Madison?

20:04:18
kristina
First, I want to announce that I am working on new written material for both www.enemabag.com and www.optimalhealthnetwork.com.

20:04:51
TomE
good evening

20:05:24
kristina
The first of this material is an article entitled, &quot;Colon Cleanse: Protect yourself from colon cancer, improve your energy, reduce fatigue, and promote weight loss&quot;

20:05:51
IowaAlan
That's what I need.

20:06:30
kristina
The article  can be viewed here 

20:06:34
TomE
do you feel a regular colon cleanse will reduce the risk of polyps?

20:07:37
kristina
Tell us more about that, Scott. I hadn't heard about your flood until DeeDee told me yesterday. She has family and friends there that have completely lost their homes.

20:07:48
kristina
Hi Tom.

20:08:11
kristina
What do you need, IowaAlan?

20:08:48
kristina
Yes, I do feel that regular and therapeutic colon cleansing will reduce the risk of polyps.

20:09:41
IowaAlan
I think your new colon clense will be great for me.

20:09:51
ScottW
In Nashville itself damage is currently listed at $1.5 billion and rising.  My county, Hickman, reportedly lost about 3800 structures, two major roads, and seven bridges.  Rain normally moves easterly across the area, but last week it stalled. 

20:10:33
kristina
The rain just stopped where you all live; then it proceeded to rain and rain and rain?

20:10:35
TomE
you were busy Wed when I stopped by to pick up my supplies.   I plan to try my new 1 gal. bucket out this week.

20:11:01
ScottW
We had  about seventeen inches of rain in 48 hours.  Now I know how Noah felt.

20:11:02
IowaAlan
I am taking enemas 3 times a week but still moving slow and very hard stool...This is due to narcotics use for back pain.

20:12:22
TomE
How much castile soap should be used per quart?

20:13:16
kristina
Even though I have worked in the colon cleanse field for all these years, I hadn't really found an herbal colon cleanse formula that I thought could really do the needed job of assisting the body to both cleanse the colon and support the liver. This new Ortho Core Restore is working clinically for my clients who are both healthy and who are chronically ill. 

20:13:37
kristina
Detoxification often wipes people out. 

20:13:41
TomE
Taking a sea salt and water enema first greatly helped, following with the soapy enema. Have done this twice with good success in still being able to insert colon tube.

20:15:22
kristina
Alan, have you tried taking an enema each day? 

20:15:32
TomE
Really like the new 60-inch colon tube with the double side nozzles. seems to really improve insertion ease and flow.

20:15:54
kristina
And, yes, would you be able to take a week and work through the Core Restore Colon Cleanse kit?

20:16:22
IowaAlan
No I have not yet.

20:16:26
kristina
It is best if you can fast for two days, take the shake twice a day, along with the supplements.

20:17:13
kristina
Use 1 teaspoon of castile soap for each quart of water.

20:17:42
TomE
thanks - will try that, although with your help the goat's milk may be just fine.

20:17:42
kristina
Detoxification often wipes people out who have low immune function is what I meant to say. too many thoughts going on all at once.

20:18:06
kristina
Good to hear, Tom, that you like the new 60-inch colon tube.

20:18:50
Vinceb
Goat's milk works great.  Need to watch the concentration.  What is a good mix?

20:19:18
DrAlbert
Hello all...

20:19:24
IowaAlan
Would soap make it easier for my body to move stool?

20:19:33
kristina
Hello Dr. Albert.

20:19:40
DrAlbert
Hi, Kristina.

20:20:44
DrAlbert
Hi, Dave.

20:20:48
TomE
soap helps during the enema series for sure.

20:20:50
kristina
Sit the made-for-enema goat milk soap in a bowl of water. Let the bar sit in the water for 1-5 minutes before you take it out and then add that solution to 2-4 quarts of water in your enema bag.

20:21:03
Dave
Hi, sorry to be late.

20:21:37
Vinceb
How much solution in the bowl to start with?

20:21:50
TomE
I just place it in my 1-gallon bag for the time and then remove it.

20:21:57
kristina
Yes, the soap helps the colon tob move out stool; it works wonders for a thorough colon cleanse.

20:22:10
kristina
Welcome, Dave.

20:22:21
kristina
1-2 cups of water.

20:22:29
Vinceb
Thanks Kristina

20:22:30
kristina
That is fine, too, Tom.

20:23:47
Dave
I think enemas can get too soapy, but Kristina's recipe sounds easy to take.

20:24:16
kristina
The goal of the Core Restore Colon Cleanse program: 1. Remove the incoming burden of toxins, 2. Restore efficient processing and elimination of toxins, 3. Revitalize the body's own natural detoxification function.

20:24:27
IowaAlan
which would work better for me - castile or goat's milk?

20:24:42
TomE
I had trouble taking the soap enema first, but Kristina's advice to start with sea salt and water for the first series, followed by soapy second serie,s made a major improvement for me.

20:24:46
kristina
My mom, who had the stroke a year ago February, is currently on her second day of the fast of the colon cleanse.

20:24:58
IowaAlan
And should I use soap every day?

20:25:10
kristina
I am so proud of her. She has even given up her daily coffee, which is a big deal for her.

20:25:16
Dave
What about  Ivory? Too harsh? once was very popular for enemas.

20:25:27
kristina
Since her stroke she has recovered her health nicely.

20:25:42
kristina
However, over the past few months she started having terrible heartburn. 

20:26:24
Dave
Are enemas/colonics part of the fast regimen, as I recall?

20:26:28
kristina
I had tried a few things with her to no avail. She had tried to resolve it with her acupuncturist. On Mother's Day, when I was at her house, I noticed that her number of prescription medications was rising!

20:26:38
TomE
I really like the goat's milk soap now that the series switch fixed my issues with difficulty with getting colon tube back in well when I started with soapy first.

20:26:43
kristina
She was on 3 prescription medications for the heartburn. Yikes!

20:26:56
kristina
Yes, enemas can get too soapy.

20:27:15
kristina
Goat's milk soap would be better for you, Alan.

20:27:23
kristina
No Ivory.

20:27:49
TomE
Goat's milk also seems to add more lubricity to the colon as well . 

20:27:58
kristina
They can be part of the fast but they don't have to be; it all depends on how well your bowels are moving with the product.

20:28:02
Vinceb
I've notice that the initial temperatiure of the water with goat's milk does make a difference on how soapy it gets.  Any recommendations on the temp of the water when mixing the solution?

20:28:42
TomE
I have been working with 102-104 deg water.

20:28:58
kristina
If you empty your bowels twice daily, then you don't need to take the enema or colonic. If you don't, then I do recommend a daily water colon cleanse.

20:30:48
Vinceb
Ok Tom.  When you first start with a cup or two to make up the soapy solution, is that the temperature?

20:30:50
TomE
I typically only empty once a day but fairly regular to that.

20:31:27
TomE
Yes, again I just do it in my bag for about 5 minutes at rest.

20:31:54
TomE
I usually work with 3 quarts of water in bag.

20:32:27
TomE
Normally just get a light color of white milky looking water with that.

20:32:30
kristina
  Sorry - had to take a quick phone call. I made a website recently for my daughter's school and I am looking to launch it on Friday, so I am working on last-minute details. So...where are we?

20:33:00
Vinceb
Soap concentration to start...Thanks Tom.

20:33:01
kristina
100 to 102 degrees, about.

20:33:37
TomE
Kristina, if you were to shave off some goat's milk, would you suggest the same teaspoon to a quart for goat's milk?

20:33:58
kristina
In the April newsletter, I posted an article all about stool and what to look for in a daily bowel movement.

20:34:07
TomE
I noted that shaving off flakes and dissolving is another method.

20:34:29
kristina
Roughly.

20:34:31
kristina
and  yes.

20:35:01
kristina
So, I called my mom tonight, to check in with how she was doing. She is finishing up day two and she has no heartburn!

20:35:35
kristina
Of course, the real test will come when she begins to eat food again, but I think we can figure this one out.

20:35:41
Vinceb
Good to hear.

20:36:12
kristina
What was amazing was that she didn't have a headache.

20:36:18
kristina
She drinks a good pot of coffee a day. 

20:36:30
Vinceb
Need to sign off.  Later.

20:36:36
Dave
Re chart, sadly I am usually 12-3 because of meds. Weekly enema a good addition to herbal laxative?

20:36:43
kristina
bye, vince.

20:37:02
Dave
1-3

20:37:50
kristina
A weekly enema is usually useful for everyone.

20:38:00
kristina
What herbal laxative are you talking about?

20:39:22
kristina
The detox herbs in the PhytoCore supplement in the Core Restore Kit really do their job to support the body's natural liver cleansing functions. 

20:39:22
Dave
Nature's Sunshine LBSII, recommended by local therapist.

20:42:23
kristina
Also, we cannot underestimate the importance of the nutrients for phase 2 liver detoxification: n-acetyl-L-Cysteine, along with glycine and taurine. 

20:43:17
kristina
Are you using the Nature's Sunshine LBSII daily and over many months?

20:46:19
kristina
Dave, there are excellent, supportive herbs in the product: licorice root, ginger, oregon grape root and red clover flowers. However, there are herbs in this formula that act on the colon in such a way to reduce its functioning: buckthorn bark and turkey rhubarb.

20:47:26
IowaAlan
OK, I know that getting a colon up as far as possible is the best. Mine came from Kristina's website. It is a larger scale 48-in. I can get about 3 feet in. Is there any special feeling that lets one know that it is up as far as it can go?

20:47:56
Dave
For several months, but not on a daily schedule, but as needed, and also to get system restarted after a colonic. I'll do an enema as last resort but maybe it should get higher priority.

20:48:12
kristina
Often, with prescription medication, the colon backs up because of the load on the liver. I would start with a week of the Core Restore and then switch over to a daily supplement that supports liver and digestive health which would include ingredients such as ox bile, pancreatin, dehydrocholic acid, and black radish.

20:48:52
kristina
We often have these ingredients in a supplement called GB-3. If you called the Optimal Health Center (DeeDee), she could help you with this.

20:49:42
kristina
Alan, you mean a colon tube, yeah?

20:49:50
IowaAlan
Yes I do.

20:50:29
kristina
Next Live Chat: May 26th at 12 noon.

20:50:59
DrAlbert
Nice to see you are still very active in this field, Kristina.

20:51:02
kristina
we offer these ingredients...

20:51:22
kristina
Thanks, Dr. Albert. Have you been following my work for a while?

20:51:25
DrAlbert
Do you have any plans for new videos?

20:51:47
DrAlbert
Yes, you and I exchanged emails when you were coming to California.

20:51:59
DrAlbert
I wanted you to meet my friend Dr. Teresa.

20:52:09
kristina
Yes, I am in collaboration with someone on some new colon cleanse and enema videos, but I am not sure of the timeline at this point.

20:52:52
kristina
The amount of creative energy that is brewing in my business at this time is pretty tremendous. It is fun and a bit daunting. The joys of being self-employed!

20:53:06
kristina
Ah, yes.

20:53:22
DrAlbert
Would appreciate keeping posted.... and have you found any new literature on using colonic and enemas in the treatment of preteen ADD or ADHD?

20:53:28
kristina
And, my son is not going to CA for college but rather he is going to college in North Carolina!

20:53:40
DrAlbert
Keep up the good work.

20:53:44
kristina
Thank you.

20:54:06
kristina
I have not found any new literature. Have you?

20:54:35
DrAlbert
Not recently... but I've had some moms ask me about that, even if I AM retired now.

20:54:37
kristina
Just today I found some literature on using colonics for clearing the colon as one's colonoscopy prep. I was delighted.

20:54:48
kristina
Where do they find you to ask you?

20:55:12
DrAlbert
Oh, it's a small town here, mostly &quot;word of mouth&quot;

20:55:18
kristina
I do think that preteen ADD and ADHD can be treated naturally.

20:55:31
DrAlbert
But I try to be helpful if I can.

20:55:38
kristina
That is great.

20:55:57
kristina
How did you develop your interest in colon cleansing?

20:56:28
Dave
Saw ADD-enemas somewhere on internet but don't know if a scientific finding. Would require cooperation of course.

20:56:47
kristina
Yes, indeed, Dave.

20:56:56
kristina
I am going to close the Live Chat now.

20:57:07
kristina
I appreciate you all for joining me tonight.

20:57:10
ScottW
Must leave now, Kris.  Please tell DeeDee to keep offering moral support to her friends.  This whole situation down here can really take its toll on your mind.  See you later.

20:57:11
Dave
Bye.

20:57:21
DrAlbert
I once was associated with a doctor in LA who developed a line of oxygen enhancement compounds... Met Teresa, who was willing to experiment.   We used a Nellcore Oximeter to measure blood oxygen levels.

20:57:27
kristina
I imagine, Scott.

20:57:39
kristina
Thanks for spending time here. My prayers are with all of you!

20:57:43
DrAlbert
That was over 15 year ago.. 

20:57:45
DrAlbert
Thanks... 

20:57:51
DrAlbert
Be well!

20:57:53
DrAlbert
bye

20:58:20

Might you check out the page on enemabag.com on using colon tubes?
