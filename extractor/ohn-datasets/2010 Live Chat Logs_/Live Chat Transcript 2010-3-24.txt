Welcome, Chris!

13:03:52
Chris W
Hello Kristina, and good morning.

13:03:55
kristina
One of the topics for today is detoxification. Why do we detoxify? What are some of the ways that we can detoxify? Recipes for detoxification... and more.

13:04:03
kristina
Do you have anything on your mind today?

13:04:32
Chris W
I'm slow at typing, fyi, lol

13:04:50
kristina
that is fine; take your time.

13:05:29
kristina
Both of my kids, 8 and 18, are working on a typing program game. Funny that you brought this up; it makes me appreciate their efforts more!

13:05:57
Chris W
I hadn't planned on asking anything really, was planning on observing and learning, since I am still new to the detoxing process.

13:06:45
kristina
do you mind sharing since, so far, you are the only one here? For instance, what are you doing? Why are you doing it? Are you experiencing any benefits?

13:08:05
Chris W
That's good. I try to practice now and then, but when and if I try to type fast, I always revert back to watching the keys and using the wrong method, ie one or two fingers.

13:08:56
Chris W
Sure

13:09:17
kristina
A benefit of detoxification that I wish to highlight today is that when one partakes of a detoxification program, a purification of the liver, kidneys, and blood can occur.

13:10:29
kristina
I know from my work healing from a chronic illness that I need to continually pay special attention to keeping my liver and kidneys functioning well. 

13:12:16
Chris W
I guess I kind of stumbled on this type of cleansing just by accident and I did have one really good experience with it about a month ago, and it has been good a good experience the few other times as well.

13:13:59
kristina
There are so many ways a body can be overloaded, tending toward chronic inflammation and digestive and hormonal imbalances. It is the liver, kidneys, and blood that do the invaluable work of continually clearing the body so it can remain in balance.

13:14:03
kristina
Welcome folks!

13:14:18
Chris W
and yes, I think the first or second time I did it a month ago and had such a wonderful day that followed, it was because of the liver liking what I had done.

13:14:25
kristina
Please chime in whenever you wish. So far, we are a light crowd and I would love to hear from you!

13:14:34
michael b
a most wonderful wednesday to all at this chat

13:14:57
kristina
Hi Michael!

13:15:03
Chris W
Hello to all

13:15:13
kristina
What are you doing to take care of yourself these days, Michael?

13:17:00
kristina
Other advantages of detoxification include immune system stimulation, enhancing the hormonal system, and reducing or eliminating dependencies on substances such as sugar, caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol.

13:17:51
kristina
I don't know about you all, but I find the first couple days of a fast to be quite difficult. 

13:18:37
kristina
In part due to this, but also because sharing cleansing is useful in so many ways, there is a group of us beginning a detoxification program on April 5th. 

13:18:48
kristina
Either of you considering joining us?

13:18:57
Chris W
speaking of coincidences, that's about what I was going to mention next, that I am trying to quit smoking and to cut out most if not all my caffeine intake.

13:19:16
kristina
Welcome back, Najones.

13:19:39
najones
kind of new - -just observing

13:19:45
michael b
Kristina, i'm still most amazed at all the new &quot;ortho core support&quot; items you come up with. i guess i should consider same?

13:20:49
Chris W
I would like to, but as I am still in the learning stage, I probably won't be, but I appreciate your asking.

13:21:17
michael b
is this what you are talking about on april 5th ?

13:22:03
kristina
Yes, Michael, it is the Core Restore Program that I am referring to!

13:23:48
kristina
I do recommend that you consider it. This is why I asked what are you doing these days with your health.

13:24:33
Chris W
I am convinced enough that this cleansing process is so helpful to me that I feel it is helping me get my mind wrapped around the idea of stopping smoking.

13:24:34
kristina
I know how tough it can be to kick a long-time habit.

13:24:42
kristina
Wow!

13:25:00
kristina
That is simply amazing! I as so proud of you and pleased for you!

13:26:00
michael b
I will order those items you have listed today. Are there instructions included?

13:28:02
kristina
Yes, the instructions are in the Core Restore Kit. Will you join us in the process on April 5th?

13:28:11
Chris W
Well thank you. I meant to mention in the last post that I had purchased one of the colon cleansing kits becuase of the benefits I have already received with just using plain water, and so I am wanting to try or use the coffee and when I can afford to, the other products.

13:28:17
kristina
How long do you think you will partake in the process?

13:28:42
kristina
For myself, I am thinking 7 days but some folks are continuing for 21-28 days.

13:29:22
kristina
I may join them but I am not sure... Yahoo to your process, Chris!

13:30:58
kristina
Are either of you on Facebook yet?

13:31:49
Chris W
:D  thank you, I am very pleased about finding you and your website. Like I say, I am still learning, but am very happy about discovering this process, even if it was by accident. lol

13:32:16
kristina
Facebook is a great place to check in throughout this fabulous process of taking care of our bodies, trying new things, figuring out what to eat, how much coffee to use in our coffee enema, what type of enema nozzle to use, and more.

13:32:28
kristina
Or maybe not an accident!

13:32:39
kristina
How did you find the Optimal Health Network website?

13:32:55
kristina
Michael, how many years have you been around?

13:33:42
Chris W
True, could be by design or what have you. karma?? something.

13:35:23
kristina
were you simply searching on the internet?

13:36:47
kristina
What was the search term you used?

13:36:57
michael b
this the first time I have been able to get through to the chat for the two months. finally got things fixed. I have looked at Facebook, but don't have a current picture, and don't have knowledge of how to do it. it has been more than four years since I have known of you.

13:38:44
Chris W
Yes, I am still using an old operating system and so I haven't tried to get onto facebook as I am afraid it wouldn't work properly.

13:40:04
Dave
Hi, sorry I'm late.

13:40:27
michael b
Chris W, smoking killed both my father and brother. it is real dead end. 

13:40:43
Chris W
Hi Dave, newbie here.

13:40:53
kristina
Welcome, Dave!

13:41:12
Dave
Welcome from a vet of several years, chris.

13:41:52
kristina
Yes, as far as the Live Chat issues, I have a new computer and I couldn't log on using Firefox. I finally learned that there is just a bug with some computers when using some browsers. So, now I use Safari on my Mac and all is well.

13:41:59
kristina
Sorry it took me so long to figure that out!

13:42:09
kristina
No, not at all.

13:42:13
Chris W
Yes, michael, my dad died from it too and a few other relatives as well.

13:42:38
kristina
My mom almost died from smoking. She had a stroke in February of 2009.

13:42:52
kristina
She has largely quit smoking since then, which is indeed a miracle.

13:43:05
kristina
And she is doing quiet well.

13:43:19
Chris W
Great

13:43:23
kristina
One key element in her healing process is that I got her a puppy.

13:43:42
Chris W
That will help.

13:43:54
michael b
I hear Macs are less prone to bugs.

13:43:57
kristina
She loves the dog and isn't so lonely any longer and has a daily rhythm of getting outside and visiting with her neighbors.

13:44:14
Dave
Catching up from a trip. Are we discussing spring cleanse, other topics? Glad I gave up smoking decades ago.

13:45:59
Chris W
I lost my best dog in october of 09. He was three months shy of being 14. I miss him very much, but I still have another, but she is getting old too, but I know they can be very helpful to the spirit.

13:46:38
michael b
a dog smaller than Arlo?

13:47:51
kristina
Yes, I got my mom a Cairn Terrier - devil of a little dog!

13:47:55
Chris W
Glad to hear it, Dave.

13:48:08
Chris W
lol

13:48:32
Chris W
Sounds like my Dachshund

13:48:36
kristina
Dave, as you can read in the March newsletter, I have invited people to join me in a Liver Detoxification program starting on April 5th.

13:49:05
kristina
Michael here says he will join us as will Dee Dee and one of the massage therapists in my office. There are many others who are interested.

13:49:06
Dave
I'll look into it.

13:49:18
kristina
We will be using Ortho Molecular's Core Restore Kit.

13:49:32
michael b
Kristina, would you like to talk a bit more about the ortho core restore?

13:49:35
kristina
Take a look at the newsletter and if you are interested, give Dee Dee a call or just order it online.

13:49:43
kristina
The instructions are included in the kit. 

13:49:54
kristina
The kit itself is enough product for a 7-day cleanse.

13:50:46
Chris W
Are you all in Wisconsin?

13:51:20
Dave
Supplemented with enemas, colonics too I'd assume?

13:51:35
michael b
does this pretty much cover everything you do for 7 days?

13:52:02
kristina
A key element in the Core Restore products is that they support phase II detoxification by providing protein, fiber, and nutrients to help eliminate toxins.

13:53:24
kristina
The ingredients - n-acetyl cysteine, glycine, taurine, lipoic acid, green tea, ellagic acid and the vegetable blend - enhance the six phase II detoxification pathways.

13:53:54
kristina
I am in Wisconsin.

13:54:25
kristina
The one kit covers everything, except the food for the last 5 days and the enemas that you need for the 7 days.

13:55:07
kristina
Next times we all chat, my son ought to know what college he is going to. It is a very exciting time!

13:55:36
Dave
Going locally or away?

13:56:24
michael b
this sounds worth a try, so I WILL BE GLAD TO DO THIS.

13:56:38
kristina
Our next Live Chat will be at 7pm on April 14th.

13:57:05
Chris W
Ok, so is this kind of a retreat where everyone is getting together or kind of an online community get-together?

13:57:35
kristina
Do know that our 5-day, newsletter subscriber sale started yesterday and continues through Saturday and contains a coupon for 15% off of any products we offer online?

13:57:47
Dave
Should have results of liver cleanse then?

13:58:06
kristina
We won't all be in the same place, but we can support each other through e-mails, facebook, and calls. 

13:58:26
Chris W
I see

13:58:44
kristina
Yes, we will be welll on our way with our detoxification program on April 14th, won't we. Yikes!

13:59:07
michael b
i am most happy I got through to this chat. I have missed you guys.

13:59:17
kristina
See you all!

13:59:22
Dave

13:59:34
Chris W
