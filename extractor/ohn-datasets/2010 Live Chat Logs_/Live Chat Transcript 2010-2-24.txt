Hello all! I am so pleased to finally have resolved all the technical difficulties for myself with this live chat. 

12:59:15
kristina
The good part about the process is now I am more able to help others with technical difficulties. 

12:59:22
kristina
Welcome to today's live chat.

12:59:26
nma_frank
hello

12:59:30
Jo
Hi

12:59:35
kristina
Please chime in with questions, comments, concerns as you wish.

12:59:51
Mr M
Greetings all

13:00:14

hello all

13:00:34
Walt K
Hi everybody.

13:00:37
Mr M
Kris--what is your topic today?

13:02:04
kristina
I had proposed a beginning discussion of spring cleansing.

13:02:43
kristina
I also want to make sure that folks know about the new work we just put up on EnemaBag.com regarding enema use and enema mythology in the Mesoamerican cultures.

13:03:01
Dave
Dave here

13:03:12
kristina
And, we have a new Vitamin D safe tanning bed at the Optimal Health Center.

13:03:17
kristina
Hey all!

13:03:39
kristina
What topics of discussion interest you all?

13:03:43
Jo
I'll jump in with a question about coffee enemas.  Is it helpful to consume a high fiber drink following them, so the bile and residue that is released from the liver isn't reabsorbed? Is that an issue?

13:04:10
kristina
Yes, it is an issue.

13:04:25
kristina
For some, a high fiber drink might do the trick.

13:04:36
JPB
Hi, Kris... An ABC news special on Vitamin D two days ago - good timing!

13:04:38
Dave
Hi all. Mayan use of enemas is totally new to me and probably to most others. Brought up thinking enemas were a European-American treatment.

13:04:45
kristina
However, others will need to use support for both the liver and the gallbladder. A-F Betafood contains beet juice which is a good source of betaine. Betaine has been shown to be an effective lipotrophic agent. Lipotrophic agents promote the transportation and use of fats, helping to prevent the accumulation of fat in the liver.

13:04:48
Mr M
Good question -- another site recommends that the coffee enema be repeated after 4 hours -- Opinions please

13:04:55
barbara g
what is involved in your spring cleansing ? 

13:05:12
Jo
what type of liver and gallbladder support is needed?

13:05:36
Walt K
Kristina, is there another method of avoiding reabsorption than with fiber?

13:06:28
Jo
what about if I juiced some beets?  I have a juicer.

13:07:30
kristina
Yes, juiced beets are also an excellent addition to a coffee enema protocol.

13:07:45
kristina
Hey, JP!

13:07:55
nma_frank
drinking them or give an enema with juiced beets?

13:07:59
Jo
So, is the timing of this important?

13:08:45
kristina
Yes, the news  across the board about the importance of Vitamin D is that it is crucial to support the body throughout the year with regular sunshine or tanning in order to optimize immune function.

13:09:00
JPB
Hi!  Great to be here!!

13:09:17
kristina
Drink the beet juice mixture and then 3-4 hours later, take the coffee enema.

13:09:29
nma_frank
ok thank you.

13:09:31
kristina
No, drink the beet juice mixture.

13:09:55
kristina
You will also want to add carrot and lemon and possibly some cilantro and/or parsley.

13:10:23
Jo
great ideas!  I've done some of those juices.  Would it be advisable to avoid food during those 3-4 hours?

13:10:40
kristina
Beets also contain betalains.

13:11:09
kristina
These are the pigments in beets that are generally protective to the liver and the colon.

13:11:29
kristina
You can also just grate a beet and enjoy with a bit of olive oil, lemon juice and sea salt.

13:11:38
antonhealth
how come green tea isn't used in enemas? Doesn't it also have detoxing effects on the liver? Or are the SPECIFIC compounds in the coffee what's important?

13:11:43
kristina
Or, you can use AF Betafood.

13:12:16
nma_frank
a question concerning the use of soapsuds enemas. I'm a firm believer in at least a weekly 2 enema series using just soapsuds enemas with no rinses. do you believe that rinses are necessary or not necessary?

13:12:33
kristina
Spring Cleanse - I start with juicing every other day and adding in chlorophyll daily.

13:13:07
kristina
From there, at the Optimal Health Center, we are working with a cleansing program from Ortho Molecular called Core Support. 

13:13:12
Jo
what are the effects of this for you Kristina?

13:13:35
kristina
Core Support provides phase II detoxification support.

13:14:25
kristina
The ingredients included in Core Support were chosen because they support one of the six phase II detoxification pathways.  N-Acetyl Cysteine along with glycine and taurine, are well known amino acids for their role in supporting the liver.  Antioxidants like lipoic acid, green tea, ellagic acid, and the vegetable antioxidant blend provide a synergistic approach to liver support and detoxification.

13:14:42
kristina
Do you mean why do I partake of a spring cleanse and how do I feel afterwards?

13:15:08
Jo
yes! :D 

13:16:46
kristina
A spring detoxification program helps restore healthy digestive system function by removal of harmful toxins and enhances nutrient absorption, which helps my long-troubled digestive tract and makes me feel energized.

13:17:20
Jo
that's great to have more energy!

13:17:36
kristina
I do think it is important to rinse the colon after a soapsuds enema.

13:18:04
Jo
Do you consider the goat milk soap that you sell a soapsuds enema?

13:18:06
JPB
In my humble opinion, I strongly agree on the subject of rinsing.

13:18:18
kristina
It is also crucial to only use a soap of ingredients that you would also eat, like our made-for-enema goat milk soaps.

13:19:21
ScottW
Speaking of coffee, the last time we talked (before the troubles), I had asked you about retaining caffeine after an enema.  I know you didn't know the answer, but do you have sources or a direction for information on this?  Caffeine is a critical item for

13:19:33
ScottW
me because of heart troubles.

13:19:39
nma_frank
isn't everything expelled with a soapsuds enema? What does the rinse accomplish? i don't usually rinse, and in 62 years of enema taking, have never had a problem from not rinsing. I do have some of your GMS, and do use that often. also use Ivory.

13:19:51
kristina
Just want to make sure that you all know we just began our newsletter sale today. As a newsletter subscriber, you receive 15% off all items in our store when you order from us online.

13:19:57
Dave
On spring cleansing: So it's a combination of nutrition and enemas/colonics? Some may neglect the nutrition part.

13:20:04
Jo
Can you address the issue of tap water vs. spring water for enemas?  I am concerned that the use of tap water with fluoride and other harmful  ingredients may be stripping my body of the good bacteria, just like it does in the water.  what do you think?

13:20:48
kristina
Ingredients in Ivory soap: The Ivory soap bar (classic) had contained: sodium tallowate, sodium cocoate or sodium palm kernelate, water, sodium chloride, sodium silicate, magnesium sulfate, and fragrance

13:21:55
nma_frank
i understand the ingredients; what is left when you expel?

13:22:19
nma_frank
can't be much of anything with either soap.

13:22:22
kristina
Scott, you are wondering about how much caffeine is absorbed into the body from a coffee enema?

13:23:23
ScottW
Yes.  The benefits sound good, but it's the aftereffects that concern me.

13:23:43
antonhealth
I also have been wondering about that.

13:24:29
kristina
The most important factor when using soap in the enemas is to use a soap that doesn't have any ingredients in it that could interact with the body in a harmful way, like our therapeutic soaps. 

13:24:45
Mr M
Regarding the need for rinse enemas after soapsuds -- Early hospital enemas always had lots of Ivory soap and were effective -- but the gut burned after the treatment -- and the nurses didn't offer a rinse out -- Rinse enemas are essential

13:24:58
kristina
Yes, nutrition is absolutely a key part of any cleansing program.

13:25:22
kristina
Even if you eat poorly most of the time, it is crucial to optimize your diet for a period of time before you cleanse.

13:25:51
kristina
Do not jump into any cleansing program without a therapeutic diet in place first.

13:26:45
kristina
Scott, can you tell me what happens to you? My first hunch is to tell you to use only a very small amount of coffee, say 1 tablespoon to one cup of brewed coffee.

13:27:24
Dave
Ivory somehow got ingrained in the culture as what to put in an enema. Even recommended by name in home care books.

13:27:32
JPB
&quot;A very little soap goes a long way when it comes to enemas and in the absence of impaction quite often soaps and chemical stimulants are unnecessary.&quot; (excerpted from Basic In-Home Colon Cleansing)

13:27:42
kristina
Regarding the soap, I truly don't know what is left when you expel it. Let's use the experience of taking a shower. 

13:27:55
kristina
We rinse the soap off our bodies.

13:28:12
kristina
Thanks, JP

13:28:32
nma_frank
i appreciate your answers. Thank you.

13:28:39
kristina
you are very welcome.

13:28:43
kristina
This is why I am here.

13:29:36

Other ingredients in our Core Support Spring Cleanse program:  Why These Natural Ingredients? Phytocore was created as part of The Core Restore BT Kit.  Phytocore supports phase I and phase II detoxification by providing phytonutrients to help eliminate toxins and stimulate the liver during a 7-28 day detoxification program. Silymarin may be one of the most well known liver supporting agents in alternative medicine.  Silymarin has a strong history of use for its role in protecting the liver from medications and environmental contaminants.  Silymarin, along with curcumin and radish root increase phase II enzyme activity in the liver while artichoke, yellow dock, and dandelion root act as gentle choleretic agents.   

13:29:42
ScottW
Blood pressure is the problem.  My provider cut my intake drastically when high blood pressure showed up (two cups a day) and was very clear that 2 cups a day were all that I was permitted from all sources.

13:31:19
kristina
Here is a bit more about Ivory from Wikipedia: Ivory soap had been more caustic in comparison to some milder bars such as Dove, a non-soap synthetic detergent bar. Plus, some consumer investigations had found that Ivory's antimicrobial activity was better than other skin soaps, even those containing antibacterials such as triclosan.[citation needed] A postulate for this effectiveness is the ability of the soap to lyse bacteria efficiently, and to rinse cleanly. The drawback to the soap was its drying effect on the skin, as it had easily dissolved natural oils. Of all the commercial soaps, Ivory has been considered the best by holistic health people, but was criticized for what it did not contain, glycerin. One reason was that glycerin was expensive and would raise the cost of the bars, which had the value of being about the least expensive soap available for people of modest means.

13:32:06
kristina
Have you tried coffee enemas?

13:32:46
ScottW
No, been afraid to.

13:33:01
Dave
Didn't castile largely replace Ivory in hospitals and homes for enemas?

13:33:27
kristina
I believe so.

13:33:46
kristina
We offer Dr. Bronner's Castile Soap also.

13:34:02
Dave
I know some still use Ivory, if only for nostalgia's sake.

13:34:26
kristina
Here is a bit about what type of tanning bed you want to look for. I now recommend that most people use a tanning bed optimized for Vitamin D in the winter.

13:34:59
nma_frank
i use it because i love the smell, it feels good, and, like the GMS, it does a great job of cleaning.

13:35:09
Dave
Not me, the Ivory went in our enema can!

13:35:37
km
I am new. What time of the day is best to do enema? How often? distilled water only is good? I do it to solve constipation.

13:35:40
kristina
However, while UVB rays account for the health benefits of sunshine, tanning salons are more interested in UVA rays. This is because overexposure to UVB rays, which affect the surface layers of skin, quickly causes sunburns. On the other hand, UVA rays are responsible for the golden-brown tan sought after by most salon patrons. As a result, most tanning salons calibrate their tanning beds to emit approximately 95 percent UVA rays. This calibration maximizes the tanning effects of the machine and minimizes the risk of burning. Unfortunately, it also minimizes the amount of vitamin D that can be metabolized relative to the exposure to damaging ultraviolet rays. In other words, you want your tanning bed calibrated to maximize the amount of vitamin D that your body can metabolze relative to the exposure to damaging ultraviolet rays.

13:36:04
kristina
Welcome, KM.

13:36:39
km
I try to solve constipation. Enema will do it?

13:36:40
kristina
When one takes an enema depends on so many factors. 

13:37:05
kristina
I tend to think the morning, upon rising, is the best time to take an enema.

13:37:15
kristina
However, this won't be true for everyone.

13:37:30
kristina
Some people just aren't going to find the time to take an enema first thing in the morning.

13:37:48
km
Before bed time is OK?

13:38:06
kristina
the number one factor to taking an enema is that it comes at a time when you can relax and take an enema series.

13:39:04
kristina
Have you checked out our informational enema resources on EnemaBag.com?

13:39:17
kristina
Yes, taking an enema before bedtime is just fine.

13:39:24
nma_frank
weather raising the cane here... sorry power took a hit.

13:39:27

I purchased the cleansing board kit and others. I have to learn how to do it.  I will check that information

13:39:31
kristina
Enemas will help to resolve constipation.

13:39:47
km
thank you

13:39:52
kristina
yikes

13:39:57
Dave
I know enema when needed was/is taken in a.m., about the time a BM would occur. Disturbs bodily schedule less I think.

13:40:09
km
how much water to begin with?

13:40:10
kristina
anyone else have any thoughts on time of day?

13:40:59
nma_frank
i prefer mornings because i'm alone at that time and can take my enemas peacefully.

13:41:05
Mr M
I find the early morning enema series allow plenty of time to drain and recover

13:41:07
kristina
Take the water into your body slowly; take as much water as your body will allow - you will be able to take 1 quart to 3 quarts of water into your colon on the first fill.

13:41:32
kristina
I don't recommend distilled water.

13:41:38
antonhealth
I love mornings, but also found that afternoon, well after lunch and before dinner is nice - it restores energy and vitality mid-day when people tend to crash

13:41:40
km
thank you. i will use distilled water. ok?

13:42:33
kristina
Distilled water is devoid of minerals; if you use it, add sea salt.

13:42:40
RC
hello  - how long before a meal or after a meal should we take an enema?

13:42:51
kristina
You do want a pure  water to take into the body with your colon cleanse.

13:43:49
kristina
Hello

13:43:54
km
How about drink water in bottle we purchase from store?

13:44:18
kristina
There are so many water sources available, and so many issues with water.

13:44:27
kristina
What water do you drink?

13:44:43
kristina
The issue with store bought water is the fact that it mostly stored in plastic bottles

13:44:55
kristina
do you have a filtration system from which you drink water at home?

13:45:06
km
purified water reverse osmosis installed in our house.

13:45:58
kristina
I wouldn't eat a meal and then take a colon cleanse. You can certainly eat right after you cleanse your colon.

13:46:11
kristina
Use that water, KM

13:47:09
RC
ok how long after a meal like 2 hours?

13:47:22
kristina
about the time a BM would naturally occur; disturbs the bodily schedule less

13:47:30
kristina
I completely agree with this

13:47:37
km
thank you. I will log out., and read the conversation later. Thank you very much.

13:47:40

yes, 2 hours is great.

Hi Alison!

13:51:38
kristina
I was just on Facebook, looking for a link that  you had sent and I see that you announced this live chat! Thanks and hello

13:51:54

I recommend everyone check out Alison's writings, too.

13:52:18
kristina
Who naps?

13:52:25
kristina
Naps are therapeutic!

13:52:34
kristina
Yesterday, I had a twenty-minute nap.

13:52:40
Dave
Mainly as a quick and effective remedy from childhood, but on a schedule of colonics as well now. i think that may be fairly typical for those into the practice.

13:52:47
antonhealth
Hi Kristina - good stuff to pass along!

13:52:52
kristina
Most days, I don't nap at all but today during my body work session, I rested deeply.

13:52:59
kristina
Thank you.

13:54:12
kristina
For those of you who are doing the coffee enemas, please do make sure that you are using an organic coffee. Also, the work with the beets is going to improve the biological benefits of taking regular coffee enemas.

13:55:38
kristina
The main underfunctioning gallbladder symptom is acute or intermittent pain in the abdomen. Indigestion, gas, a feeling of fullness after meals, constipation, and nausea are the other usual symptoms. Other gall bladder symptoms include intolerance to fats, dizziness, jaundice, anemia, acne, and other lesions. The main cause of gall-bladder disorders is overnutrition resulting from excessive intake of refined carbohydrates, especially sugar.

13:57:05
kristina
The coffee enemas work, in part, by stimulating the gallbladder to dump more bile into the digestive tract. However, if the gallbladder is congested, the coffee enemas won't work properly.

13:58:40
kristina
Now, that I am writing about this, I think I will have this topic be the feature article in next month's newsletter: Supporting the Liver and the Gallbladder for the Greatest Gains of the Coffee Enema.
