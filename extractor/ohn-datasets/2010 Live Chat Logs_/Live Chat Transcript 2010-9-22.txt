Welcome everyone! Today you will be talking to me - Dee Dee instead of Kristina.  She had to take her daughter Rayna to an appointment today, so here I am.  This is my first official live chat (though I &quot;chat&quot; with many of you on the phone every day) so bear with me.

13:04:03
michael b
is this ms. delkamp?

13:04:05
Dee Dee
I will also need to duck out early today, because I have a client coming in, but anything we do not get to today, please e-mail me directly at deedee@[ourdomain].com and I will answer all questions.

13:04:17
Dee Dee
Hi Michael, the one and only

13:05:02
Dee Dee
Hi Jo D

13:05:11
Jo D
Hi Dee Dee

13:05:32
Dee Dee
I hope everyone will be able to log in today.  I already got a phone call from someone having troubles.

13:05:44
michael b
Well it is the autumnal equinox today, so there.

13:05:54
Dee Dee
Does anyone have anthing they want to talk about?

13:06:46
Dee Dee
Tell me more about autumnal equinox.

13:07:23
Jo D
No specific questions, just looking for support with coffee enemas. I'm doing chelation for some heavy metals right now.

13:07:32
michael b
What happened to ms. amelong?

13:07:59
Dee Dee
As I am getting older (I am reminded again this Saturday as I turn 45), I realize how having great health is so important.

13:08:31
Dee Dee
Jo D, what are you doing for detox right now, and what heavy metals are you working on?

13:08:32
Jo D
Happy birthday to you! :) 

13:08:57
Dee Dee
Jo D, have you done coffee enemas before? 

13:09:08
michael b
45, you are still just a puppy.

13:09:20
Dee Dee
Thank you! 

13:09:54
Jo D
I am taking EDTA suppositories for lead chelation.  Yes, I've done coffee enemas. Right now, I use my intuition when I think I need a coffee enema. It's turning out to be about 2X a week, but am wondering if I should do it more often with the chelation.

13:11:40
Dee Dee
Yes, you can try doing coffee enemas more regularly during chelation to help support your liver during that time.  If daily seems too much, just listen to your body and do less if you get too many side effects.

13:12:08
Jo D
What side effects have you seen with EDTA?

13:12:43
Jo D
or do you mean side effects with the coffee enema?

13:13:44
Dee Dee
We do not work with EDTA [Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid]

13:14:47
Dee Dee
but I have read that it is very poorly absorbed by the rectum (7%) and may be damaging to the mucosal lining.

13:15:25
Dee Dee
Side effects of too quick a detox (coffee enemas) can be flu-like symptoms, headaches, etc.

13:15:43
Dee Dee
Hi James! 

13:16:13
Jo D
Oh dear, that's not very encouraging about the EDTA, but my N.D. said that EDTA oral would not be good for digestion reasons.

13:17:27
Dee Dee
I would have to look into the EDTA more thoroughly to really be able to give you more info.  Have you had any irritation from it at this point?

13:17:47
michael b
I read Tom's of Maine toothpaste has been sold to Colgate, but now contains sodium lauryl sulfate - not good. Does OHN recommend  any toothpastes? 

13:17:52
Jo D
No I haven't.

13:18:16
Dee Dee
Jo, have you had a hair tissue mineral analysis test by us yet?  I would strongly encourage this.

13:18:24
james H
Have you noticed that enemas are increasing in popularity?

13:18:40
Jo D
Thank you, Dee Dee. I will definitely consider that.

13:18:58
Jo D
Yes, i've noticed more and more publicity about enemas too.

13:19:24
Dee Dee
We don't really recommend a brand.  I used to use Shaklee's, but I think they are discontinuing it.  I will try and remember the other brand name I have used which I think is still good.

13:20:35
Dee Dee
Enemas are definitely becoming more accepted and well-known.  Is it because people are looking into more natural health practices and are sick of taking medications?  what do you think?

13:21:53
Jo D
Yes I agree!  In the circle of the raw food movement, they talk a lot about colon hydrotherapy, and the importance of detox. Some have mentioned coffee enemas too, and the Gerson therapy is widely discussed there too for cancer patients.

13:22:17
Dee Dee
The other toothpaste I have used is Burt's Bees.

13:23:29
Dee Dee
Jo, very true.  Our friend Matt Monarch (know very well in the raw food world) promotes enemas and colon cleansing.

13:24:12
Jo D
I didn't know you knew him! I just met Matt and Angela in Oakland, CA, at their lecture a few weeks ago. Wonderful couple.

13:24:18
james H
I listened to Dr.Oz a couple weeks ago and he said and demonstrated with a prop that many people are carrying 3 days accumulation of waste in their colons. He recommended more fiber and eating prunes, but no mention of enemas.

13:24:46
Jo D
Ha ha, Dr. Oz. That's because people would be too grossed out on national TV.  Too bad for them.

13:24:48
Dee Dee
I use coffee implants a lot here with my clients, and almost everyone seems to have some benefits from them.

13:25:27
Jo D
Ok, I gotta go. Thanks for the support, everyone! Have a good equinox today.

13:25:32
michael b
Burt's - thanks. Young Living sells some toothpaste with oil of thieves.

13:25:52
Dee Dee
I am sure that they don't want to talk about enemas on TV! The network would probably not let him, even if he believes in them.

13:26:39
Dee Dee
There is some hope though.  A client of mine is an MD PhD and he is spreading the word.  He is a true believer in the healing power of the enema.

13:26:47
Dee Dee
Bye Jo

13:26:56
michael b
Jo D, keep up the good fight.

13:27:26
james H
That is a shame. Keep up the good work.

13:27:26
Dee Dee
Yes, Young Living Thieves is great!  I actually have some of that at home too.

13:29:16
james H
Mom believed enemas speeded up the healing process.

13:29:47
michael b
Network TV is afraid of everything, mostly low ratings.

13:30:07
Dee Dee
Kristina and I will be talking to other colon therapists in the upper midwest soon during a conference to help them to understand about in-home cleansing and health care so that they can also support their clients that way, like we do.

13:30:13
Dee Dee
Hopefully that will go well.

13:30:47
Dee Dee
We then may be able to go nationwide with the info.

13:30:54
michael b
Where are you going?

13:31:11
Dee Dee
We will be in Minnesota.

13:32:40
Dee Dee
Because of my birthday coming up and after listening to a webinar on cellular vitality, it made me think more about how our body continuously tries to regenerate itself and what we can do to assist that process.

13:32:54
michael b
Oh ya, you betchem. Have fun as well.

13:34:18
Dee Dee
We will.

13:35:08
michael b
If you are really lucky, maybe you will hear the state bird, the common loon.

13:35:39
Dee Dee
The stress associated with everyday life, not to mention aging, have a complex and challenging effect on the body. 

13:35:52
Dee Dee
Looking forward to hearing the loon.

13:37:26
Dee Dee
James, is there a particular enema regimen that you follow that is effective for you?

13:38:09
michael b
Also, in St. Paul at the 3M building is one of best IMAX theatres - go there if possible.

13:38:47
Dee Dee
If we have some time, that would be great.  The seminar is at a spa, so we may take in some pampering therapies as well!

13:39:58
Dee Dee
Is everyone staying healthy so far this season?  It seems that many of us are experiencing allergy symptoms, even those people who usually don't.

13:41:52
james H
I had thrown away our 2 Quart Davol after 45 years. Now I am looking for a good heavy-duty fountain syringe of the same quality. We have your 4 quart which is very good but would like something smaller. Any recommendations?

13:42:31
michael b
Sounds pretty rough. Also check what is at the Walker Arts Center. I realize there is only so much time.

13:44:05
Dee Dee
Fatigue, the body's response to stress, and specific challenges within body mechanisms (cellular growth/proliferation, digestion, and the cardiovascular system) can be signs that the body needs more help meeting everyday needs.

13:44:41
michael b
Are you going to fly or drive? Are the leaves changing color yet?

13:45:26
Dee Dee
What 4 quart bag of ours do you have, James? 

13:46:10
Dee Dee
We are driving in early October, so it should be beautiful.  The spa will fit right into my topic of cellular vitality!

13:48:30
michael b
That's great. Take a camera, get someone to take a picture of you two.

13:48:35
james H
 My wife Laura uses a transparent 4 quart Klystra and I have a 4 quart red Klystra. We do a &quot;cleanout&quot; once a week.

13:48:57
Dee Dee
Hi binskeep.

13:50:34
Dee Dee
We do carry the 2 quart red bag, but it is not Klystra brand.

13:50:44
james H
Laura had an enema this morning for a headache. It relieved the problem.

13:51:06
Dee Dee
That is great.  Enemas are great for headaches.

13:52:13
michael b
Are there any new products, sales, or  videos in the line up?

13:54:11
Dee Dee
There will be a new newsletter and sale coupon coming out very soon, in the next couple of days, and the sale usually runs through the end of the month.  We are looking at providing enema bag covers made of recycled sweaters, to make your bags pretty and keep the water warm. I am not sure when those covers will be on the website, though.

13:55:30
Dee Dee
Michael, I am sure you will be one of the first customers to try one!

13:55:39
michael b
Are they going to be like animals of choice thereof?

13:56:24
Dee Dee
There will be all different designs - not sure about animals, but maybe you can request one?

13:56:58
Dee Dee
Hi Bobb

13:57:36
Dee Dee
Does anyone having anything before I have to log out and be with my client?  I have about 3 minutes or so.

13:57:49
michael b
A duck-billed platypus?

13:58:12
Dee Dee
We may be able to accommodate that!

14:00:07
michael b
Another great chat. Be careful. May both you and Kristina stay well.

14:00:28
Dee Dee
Thank you, Michael. We will. You also.

14:01:13
Dee Dee
Thanks everyone.  I'll have to try this again sometime.  Great to talk to you all.  Bye for now.  Call or e-mail me if you want to talk more.

14:01:56
michael b
May all of you fellow chatters have great holidays.

14:02:13
michael b
Bye now.
