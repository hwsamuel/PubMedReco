Hello folks

21:00:02&nbsp;
Kristina
How are ya all doing tonight?

21:00:23&nbsp;
LoneEagle
Ok but not great

21:01:29&nbsp;
Kristina
Please do start posting what is on your minds tonight.

21:02:28&nbsp;
LoneEagle
I have one of your implant plugs but I find it hard to insert. what lube do you recommend using with it?

21:02:55&nbsp;
Kristina
What lubricant have you tried?

21:03:16&nbsp;
LoneEagle
Your super salve and KY

21:03:29&nbsp;
Kristina
Did one work better than the other or no?

21:03:31&nbsp;
Lisa
Super salve works great on plugs!

21:03:54&nbsp;
Kristina
You might need to lubricate both the plug and the anal area.

21:03:57&nbsp;
Buzz
Question.  I have tried almost all your colon tubes, and with no success.  Use olive oil, KY, running water and never get by the first bend.  Just ordered your new tube with Delrin tip.  Would it work if I started on my left side, then lie on edge of bed with

21:04:32&nbsp;
Buzz
my shoulders down and have my wife insert tube?

21:06:25&nbsp;
johnnypops
Hi Kristina, my name is John.  I have some questions to ask. Since I have heart disease, 1. is it safe to use the COFFEE enema due to the stimulant, caffeine, 2. I am taking Zocor (simvastatin) and cannot eat grapefruit nor drink grapefuit juice.

21:06:51&nbsp;
Kristina
My guess is the larger, stiffer colon tube will work better for you. However, some folks find that they need to use an excessive amount of lubricant. For instance, one technique is to use our implant syringe with colon tube to deliver olive oil or Surgilube into the colon and then insert the colon tube. Also, do you try using the colon tube after you have cleared out the lower colon?

21:07:08&nbsp;
michael b
a most wonderful hello to all at this chat.

21:07:29&nbsp;
Kristina
The position for insertion you describe is an excellent position to try. 

21:07:36&nbsp;
Kristina
Hi John.

21:07:39&nbsp;
Buzz
Yes I do.  And have implanted oil as i go.

21:08:21&nbsp;
Buzz
Thank you.  Will try that position when i receive the new colon tube.

21:09:44&nbsp;
Firestar
Hi.  Fire here.  First time on this chat.  Could someone repeat the question where Kristina answered &quot;larger, stiffer colon tube will work better...

21:09:47&nbsp;
Buzz
I will connect a syringe with KY to tube, and have her apply it as she goes.  If that doesn't work, I QUIT !

21:09:48&nbsp;
Kristina
John, I think you would find excellent benefits from a coffee enema. However, I would start with a very small amount of coffee, one tablespoon of brewed coffee to one to four cups of filtered water.

21:10:13&nbsp;
Kristina
John, what has inspired you to try coffee enemas? Do you have any other health issues? 

21:10:31&nbsp;
Kristina
Do you drink caffeinated beverages?

21:10:40&nbsp;
johnnypops
Is it safe for me to use GSE?

21:11:30&nbsp;
michael b
kristina, is cilantro as good for binding as china chlorella ?

21:12:06&nbsp;
johnnypops
I have read your info re: cleaning the liver and was going to try it.

21:12:37&nbsp;
Kristina
What would you use Grapefruit Seed Extract or GSE for? How much would you use?

21:13:55&nbsp;
Lisa
Hey Dave, you were able to log in this time! So glad!

21:14:18&nbsp;
Dave
Five times. first success!

21:14:27&nbsp;
Kristina
Cilantro mobilizes mercury, aluminum, lead and tin stored in the brain and in the spinal cord and moves it into the connective tissues. The mobilized mercury appears to be either excreted via the stool, the urine, or translocated into more peripheral tissues. 

21:15:22&nbsp;
Dave
Among topics, cn we do bifudis implants and recipe for it?

21:15:23&nbsp;
Kristina
Chlorella also enhances mobilization of mercury compartmentalized in non-neurologic structures such as the gut wall, muscles, ligaments, connective tissue, and bone.

21:15:40&nbsp;
johnnypops
To clean my equipment, currently, I am using antibacterial soap to clean the equipment after each use.

21:15:47&nbsp;
Kristina
Chlorella is an important part of the systemic mercury elimination program, as approximately 90% of the mercury is eliminated through the stool. Using large doses of chlorella facilitates fecal mercury excretion. After the intestinal mercury burden is lowered, mercury will more readily migrate into the intestine from other body tissues from where   chlorella will effectively remove it.

21:16:04&nbsp;
Kristina
Cilantro alone often does not remove mercury from the body; it often only displaces the metals form intracellularly or from deeper body stores to more superficial structures, from where it can be easier removed with the previously described agents.

21:16:51&nbsp;
Lisa
Johnny, best to use castile soap. That is not toxic.

21:17:12&nbsp;
Kristina
With all that said, I would use liberal amounts of cilantro in the diet but I would always make sure that you are additionally using coffee enemas and/or another bowel cleanser.

21:18:36&nbsp;
Dave
I have used 10 pct bleach solution but guess that is not the best. in any case, old-fashioned enema can seems easiest to clean.

21:19:13&nbsp;
LoneEagle
I have one of new colon tubes - which way should the curve be for the best insertion?

21:19:24&nbsp;
johnnypops
Kristina, is antibacterial soap ok to use for cleaning the equipment after using it?

21:19:31&nbsp;
michael b
thanks kristina, i buy fresh frozen chopped cilantro, imported from kabutz dorot.

21:19:34&nbsp;
Kristina
Yes, enema cans are exceptionally easy to clean. However, so are most 4 quart enema bags, which offer the user a better chance to clear out the entire colon. 

21:20:20&nbsp;
Kristina
It is mostly the nozzle that needs antibacterial soak with a solution like GSE and water after you have scrubbed it good with soap. 

21:20:55&nbsp;
Firestar
What is GSE?

21:21:56&nbsp;
Kristina
Antibacterial soap is okay to use in the sense that it will do the job of cleaning the equipment.

21:22:45&nbsp;
Mike K
  Firestar     grapefruit seed extract

21:22:59&nbsp;
Kristina
However, there are problems with antibacterial soaps.

21:23:00&nbsp;
Firestar
Thanks, Mike.

21:23:02&nbsp;
Kristina
Triclosan, widely used as an antibacterial ingredient in household hand sterilization products, breaks down rapidly when exposed to chlorinated water and produces toxic chemicals including chloroform.

21:23:06&nbsp;
Dave
I guess that's why the can was the usual enema equipment in hospitals pre-Fleet, and my mom's choice for us too.

21:23:41&nbsp;
Kristina
Chloroform is a toxic chemical and probable carcinogen. 

21:24:58&nbsp;
Kristina
It is best to use soaps that use natural products containing herbal ingredients that are naturally antibacterial. 

21:25:16&nbsp;
LoneEagle
Like Dr. Bronner's

21:25:30&nbsp;
michael b
i cannot find oil of thieves, do you sell it?

21:25:31&nbsp;
Lisa
Like lavender castile soap.

21:25:41&nbsp;
Dave
How about the goat's milk soap as a bag/can cleanser?

21:25:54&nbsp;
Kristina
GSE Nutribiotic? Liquid Concentrate or Grapefruit Seed Extract contains CITRICIDAL?. CITRICIDAL is our cleaner of choice for enema bags.

21:26:14&nbsp;
johnnypops
Kristina, I don't think that you answered my question regarding the coffee enema in regards to my heart disease. please comment, thanks

21:26:25&nbsp;
Kristina
GSE is an extremely potent compound that has been proven to be antibacterial and antifungal.

21:26:56&nbsp;
Kristina
You guys are doing an really spendid job with the questions. 

21:27:05&nbsp;
Firestar
Question:  Can the inflatable balloon on a retention nozzle be replaced?  I made a quick attempt to replace it with rubber from the neck of a balloon, but it didn't seal.

21:27:07&nbsp;
Kristina
Yes, like Dr. Bronners

21:27:50&nbsp;
Dave
Well, we try, Kris LOL

21:27:54&nbsp;
Lisa
Kristina, are you still going to sell goat milk soap since you sold your goats? Do you have another source where you can get goat milk?

21:28:24&nbsp;
Kristina
Well, for some reason I lost all the text. Please post your unanswered questions again. I was kicked off.

21:28:56&nbsp;
Firestar
Here's my question again: Can the inflatable balloon on a retention nozzle be replaced? I made a quick attempt to replace it with rubber from the neck of a balloon, but it didn't seal.

21:29:08&nbsp;
LoneEagle
Which way should the curve on the new colon tube be for the best insertion?

21:29:09&nbsp;
johnnypops
Kristina, john again, because i'm using a statin, no grapefuit products, can i use it for cleaning as long as I properly rinse the equipment?

21:30:15&nbsp;
Kristina
No, the inflatable balloon on a retention nozzle can not be replaced. That was a good idea but you do not want to rig your enema nozzle in such a way because you don't want those added materials to fall off in the anal area.

21:30:38&nbsp;
Firestar
OK, thanks.

21:31:30&nbsp;
Dave
Repeating : goat's milk soap as bag or can cleanser? Also earlier: protocol for bifusidis implant?

21:31:42&nbsp;
Kristina
If you lay the colon tube on a flat surface, it will curve. The colon lays inside your belly as an upside down U. Look at the natural U of the colon tube and insert the colon tube to curve to this U.

21:32:10&nbsp;
michael b
i hope tim is well, 100% or better. where can i buy oil of thieves ?

21:32:14&nbsp;
LoneEagle
Ok Thanks

21:33:10&nbsp;
Lisa
Kristina, my question was, are you still going to sell goat milk soap even though you sold your goats? Do you have another source where you buy goat milk so the soap still can be made?

21:33:42&nbsp;
Kristina
However, for some, the sigmoid area of the colon can be a bit tricky to bypass. If following the guidelines I laid out doesn't work well, then insert the colon tube in the opposite direction and turn it slightly as you insert it.

21:34:05&nbsp;
Kristina
Yes, as long as you rinse the equipment well you will be fine.

21:34:25&nbsp;
Dave
I have an Fr38 rectal tube, but the non-business end does not seem to attach to a hose width. Remedy?

21:35:52&nbsp;
Kristina
Goat's milk soap can be used to clean enema equipment but I would still recommend using an antibacterial agent like GSE. If GSE doesn't work for you, you can use a tea tree oil soak.

21:36:53&nbsp;
Kristina
Thank you, Michael. Tim is much better. He came through Lyme's Disease with full health. However, it did spur the decision to sell the goats and the farm. Thanks for all your help, Michael. Your support was extremely welcome.

21:37:23&nbsp;
LoneEagle
also I am going to my first colon hydrotherapy session soon, seeing that my system moves real slow would it be a good idea if I try to clean out the lower end myself before 

21:37:57&nbsp;
Kristina
Thieves is an excellent oil. I highly recommend it. The only company that I know of that makes the Thieves mixture is Young Living Oils.

21:38:04&nbsp;
Mike K
Kris, what effect will tea tree oil have on latex products?

21:38:41&nbsp;
Kristina
Yes, the man who we bought our goat's from still has goats and lives in the same town where my soap maker is so he will be supplying the raw goat's milk for us.

21:39:15&nbsp;
Lisa
That's good news Kris!

21:39:22&nbsp;
Kristina
Dave, when you are at the Optimal Health Center next week, you can pick up a tubing connector.

21:39:29&nbsp;
johnnypops
Kristina, since you lost our questions, i will repeat mine again. is it safe to use a coffee enema if i have heart disease

21:40:21&nbsp;
Kristina
Taking an enema before your colon hydrotherapy session could prove to be very useful.

21:42:16&nbsp;
Kristina
Johnny, yes, you ought to benefit from coffee enemas. However, I would use a very small amount of coffee to start - 1 tablespoon per cup to quart of filtered water. And, I don't know enough about you yet to be able to answer your question with confidence. What is the extent of your heart disease? What tweaks your interest with coffee enemas? Do your bowels move daily? How is your energy level?

21:42:51&nbsp;
Dave
Thanks re connector. Also, great for Tim. I also got tick-bit but not infected, though it cost me two expensive MD visits!

21:43:00&nbsp;
Kristina
The more you can tell me the more able I would be to craft a protocol specific to your individual body.

21:43:08&nbsp;
Mike K
johnnypops, I have congestive heart failure and use coffee enemas with no ill side effects

21:44:08&nbsp;
Kristina
Tea tree oil contains consituents called terpenoids, which have been found to have antiseptic and antifungal activity. The compound terpinen-4-ol is the most abundant and is thought to be responsible for most of tea tree oil's antimicrobial activity.

21:44:36&nbsp;
Firestar
Q2:  I recently received your silicone colon tube and large volume enema movie.  It seems easier to get a thorough, comfortable clensing with the colon tube rather than a large volume enema.  Doesn't this make sense and thus why aren't colon tubes encouraged more?

21:44:49&nbsp;
Kristina
I would use the tea tree oil only on plastic and silicone enema equipment.

21:45:54&nbsp;
Lisa
Tim is very lucky he got through Lyme's disease. My daughter-in-law had it about eight years ago, and was in the hospital for a whole month! It was very serious.

21:46:44&nbsp;
Kristina
This issue of oils degrading latex over time has caused me to eliminate our latex colon tubes so, in part, that folks can use the oil-based products to clean the part of their enema equipment that comes into contact with their body.

21:47:01&nbsp;
Kristina
Yes, Lyme Disease is very serious.

21:47:23&nbsp;
Kristina
I guess all that goat milk that Tim has been drinking gave him an advantage.....hehehe

21:48:13&nbsp;
Kristina
Very good question! Colon tubes versus large volume enemas....

21:48:41&nbsp;
Kristina
How much coffee do you use? 

21:48:51&nbsp;
Lisa
I'm sure you are right about Tim drinking all that goat milk!!

21:49:08&nbsp;
johnnypops
kristina, bowels move every day without use of enemas, my cardiologist will attest, &quot;John you are strong as a BULL&quot;.  My interest, is for cleansing toxins in the liver as per your documentation, in the products area.

21:49:14&nbsp;
Kristina
Good to hear, Dave, that the tick bite didn't harm your health.

21:49:37&nbsp;
michael b
kristina, those are major changes. i hope it is all for best. did you keep 1 or 2 goats for pets, teach them tricks ?

21:50:18&nbsp;
Firestar
If you are asking me how much coffee do I use - none.  I don't like coffee.

21:51:04&nbsp;
Kristina
Johnny, what diet are you following? The key points to consider when embarking on a program of cleansing your liver is that you need the &quot;toxins&quot; to be moved into the colon from their storage sites and you need to not overwhelm your body by moving these toxins into the colon.

21:51:20&nbsp;
Kristina
LVE versus colon tube is a personal issue.

21:51:35&nbsp;
Kristina
Some people take water more easily than they take a colon tube.

21:52:04&nbsp;
Kristina
Colon tubes, because they are inserted deep into the colon, can cause harm. Water never does.

21:52:07&nbsp;
Dave
A now retired therapist of mine always advocated a pre-session enema when folks making an appointment told of impaction. She only gave enemas to little ones impacted on a doc's suggestion. But she'd always ask adults about when they had their bm. 

21:52:38&nbsp;
Kristina
Many people don't feel at ease inserting anything deep into their colon and can barely find the courage to insert a small nozzle.

21:53:02&nbsp;
Kristina
Water, if taken into the colon slowly enough, will tend to clear out the entire colon.

21:55:15&nbsp;
Kristina
Weird, I have never been kicked off the chat before but tonight it has happened twice. Did I miss any question or comment?

21:55:41&nbsp;
johnnypops
Kristina, I don't understand your last reply, can you send your data regarding the use of coffee enemas ?

21:55:50&nbsp;
Kristina
Mike, Sorry that I haven't returned your phone call. Rayna was sick this week so I am a bit behind. I plan to call you back tomorrow. Thanks for your patience.

21:56:25&nbsp;
Kristina
Our new site will have an entirely new coffee enema protocol. Look for it in the coming weeks.

21:56:34&nbsp;
Mike K
No problem

21:56:49&nbsp;
Kristina
Also, all I have written about coffee enemas is on my site and in my book, Kristina Amelong's Ten Days to Optimal Health.

21:57:42&nbsp;
Kristina
Thanks all for joining me tonight. I am so honored that you would take an hour out of your precious week to join me. See you on October 10th at 7pm, CST.

21:57:50&nbsp;
Dave
I do think the &quot;invasion&quot; mindset is more important than the size of the nozzle.

22:01:36&nbsp;
Lisa
This was a great chat tonight!
