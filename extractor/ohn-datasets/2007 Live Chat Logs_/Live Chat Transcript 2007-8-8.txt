Hi Mike and Lisa. Good to see you both here tonight!

20:51:51&nbsp;
kristina
Do you believe it? I made it!

20:56:06&nbsp;
kristina
Welcome, Debbie.

20:56:32&nbsp;
kristina
Carol, did you get any information back from your chiropractor? If so, I am interested in the details.

20:56:50&nbsp;
Debbie
Hi Kristina I was wondering if you've ever heard of a colon detox producy called colonix by Dr Natura

20:57:26&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, Colonix is a very well-marketed product available on the internet.

20:58:15&nbsp;
kristina
Why do you ask, Debbie?

20:58:43&nbsp;
billythekid
Hi everybody. Good to be here.

20:58:59&nbsp;
kristina
As we get started here tonight, I want to suggest a topic. 

20:59:53&nbsp;
Debbie
I wanted to purchase it but I wanted to be sure if it was effective 

21:01:55&nbsp;
kristina
I am ruminating on my next book and one of my goals is to share with people how other people stay healthy, keep sane, and have fun in this beautiful and difficult world. I was hoping you would all share with me tonight just what you have figured out to these ends.

21:02:12&nbsp;
kristina
Debbie, what is your goal in using the Colonix?

21:02:19&nbsp;
Lisa
Hi!

21:02:22&nbsp;
Debbie
i have been on a water fast for 3 days.  wanted to do a colon cleanse with this product when can I safely do it 

21:03:09&nbsp;
Carol45
Kristina, that is very good news about a new book!  

21:03:50&nbsp;
LoneEagle
Hello all

21:03:51&nbsp;
Lisa
To keep sane I take a trip to Europe I can't really afford! LOL!

21:04:46&nbsp;
kristina
Excellent, Lisa. How does traveling keep you sane?

21:04:46&nbsp;
Carol45
Hello LoneEagle and michael b

21:04:59&nbsp;
Lisa
That is very exciting about your new book!

21:05:14&nbsp;
Debbie
I want to detox from small intestine to colon I believe I'm very toxic due to heavy tongue coating, long time constipation and skin problems 

21:05:14&nbsp;
kristina
Debbie, are you having any symptoms of ill health?

21:05:34&nbsp;
kristina
Will you do enemas when you are using a colon cleanse product?

21:06:13&nbsp;
kristina
I have worked with many people who have used the Colonix product and have had a chance to compare its results with other products.

21:06:24&nbsp;
Carol45
In this heat I'm not so sure that I am sane! I do know that an enema series does help me to relax - and cool off.

21:07:20&nbsp;
Lisa
Traveling makes me very much sane. Learning about others that are very different from us. Not only do I see the sights, but I talk to locals and find out how they live. Did you know raw beef is popular in France? Very different from the USA!

21:07:27&nbsp;
kristina
I have found that  using Herbal Fiberblend is just as effective and less expensive than the Colonix.

21:07:28&nbsp;
michael b
lisa, aka h20 wmn., i was so sorry to read about gail. vaya con dios, gail

21:07:58&nbsp;
Debbie
I have been doing enemas and I have had colonic. they are very uncomfortable. I don't last very long. how do you rate this product?

21:08:51&nbsp;
kristina
I find that swimming often and working on my tan help me lots. I can really tell if I am not out in the sun a few times a week. I wish I lived where I could be out in the sun all year round.

21:08:54&nbsp;
Lisa
Very sad about Gail! I miss her! Our first death here!

21:09:11&nbsp;
kristina
Did you eat some raw beef when you were there?

21:09:18&nbsp;
kristina
Welcome Elsie!

21:09:51&nbsp;
ELSIE
I must have missed a lot in eight minutes.  Can someone catch me up?  Are we talking about colon cleanses?

21:09:58&nbsp;
billythekid
It is the first death than we KNOW about!

21:10:06&nbsp;
ELSIE
Thank you, Kristina.

21:10:25&nbsp;
kristina

21:10:46&nbsp;
ELSIE
What happened to Gail?

21:11:03&nbsp;
kristina
It is very similar to Herbal Fiberblend but much more expensive.

21:11:25&nbsp;
kristina
Gail died.

21:11:43&nbsp;
ELSIE
From what?

21:12:20&nbsp;
ELSIE
Cancer, kidney failure, old age, heart?

21:12:22&nbsp;
Lisa
Gail was getting prepared for cancer surgery and died of a heart attack! She was 54 years young.

21:12:38&nbsp;
kristina
The tea bags used with the Colonix use Senna, which can be bought at most stores as Smooth move tea. 

21:13:43&nbsp;
Carol45
We are getting a nice crowd this evening.  Hello to the new signers-in. 

21:13:50&nbsp;
kristina
My understanding of why most people engage in a colon cleanse is to pull toxins out of their body and to remove more than &quot;normal&quot; waste.

21:14:06&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, I very much appreciate all of you who are here tonight. 

21:14:32&nbsp;
LoneEagle
I found an online company that sells 8 mg senna 1000 tabs 21.99

21:15:08&nbsp;
ELSIE
I have used the Colonix just a few weeks ago for a colon cleanse before I went on a weight loss protocol.  It was a pain in the neck drinking all that junk in the morning.  The evening tea wasn't bad at all, though.

21:15:16&nbsp;
kristina
The herbs that are in most colon cleansing products aren't able to pull toxins out of their storage sites but rather only pull toxins out of the body that are already circulating through the system.

21:15:46&nbsp;
kristina
How do you do with the Senna, LoneEagle?

21:16:26&nbsp;
LoneEagle
It seems to be working I have only been taking it for 2 weeks

21:16:32&nbsp;
kristina
With my history of IBS, I have found that senna is just too harsh and gives me lots of cramps, whereas the aged bark Cascara Sagrada works to empty my colon as well as strengthens it without giving me cramps.

21:16:49&nbsp;
kristina
I had been taking one capsule of the aged bark Cascara sagrada for a year. 

21:17:19&nbsp;
Debbie
I have done enemas and I see a lot of times (sorry for being graphic) yellowish stuff that I think looks like mucus, but I'm not sure. what do you think?   

21:17:29&nbsp;
LoneEagle
I take 8.6 morning and night  100 ducosate sodium pm and 17g miralax mornings

21:17:33&nbsp;
michael b
is that daily ?

21:17:47&nbsp;
Lisa
Colonix and stuff like that are expensive! I will just stick to good cheap enemas that work better than anything!

21:17:54&nbsp;
kristina
A few weeks ago, I started to have diarrhea. I backed down to 5/6th of a capsule and my bowels have returned to fully formed. 

21:18:00&nbsp;
LoneEagle
Mine yes daily

21:18:32&nbsp;
Carol45
Kristina, I really feel that your 10-day program helped to prepare my body for the fast and pulling toxins out of my body. 

21:19:06&nbsp;
kristina
For pulling toxins out of the system, you want to use items like coconut oil, butter oil, dietary changes, raw dairy, orange juice, cherry juice and so on.

21:19:44&nbsp;
Carol45
Unfortunately with the stress of my job lately - I'm probably piling them back in. :o 

21:20:30&nbsp;
kristina
These foods, along with enemas and/or a colon cleanse product, will pull out toxins from their storage sites and strengthen your digestive system.

21:20:42&nbsp;
Debbie
I have candida. I can't have fruit

21:21:05&nbsp;
kristina
Can others please share a bit about what they do to stay healthy, sane and happy?

21:21:22&nbsp;
kristina
You would stick to the other foods then.

21:21:47&nbsp;
Karen
Is it OK to use the small plastic bucket used for coffee enemas to do high volume enema. Is the tube too small? I just fill it as needed. This is all new to me!

21:21:50&nbsp;
kristina
Debbie, graphic is good.

21:21:59&nbsp;
Lisa
Playing music keeps me happy!

21:22:06&nbsp;
kristina
Most yellow release is a mixture of bile and stool

21:22:08&nbsp;
ELSIE
I was going to a nutritionist in my area and she had me doing juice for detox as well as supplements.  She had me on a heavy metal cleanse and when I reached the &quot;healing crisis&quot; state she couldn't help me.

21:23:09&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, you can use the small plastic bucket. You most likely would need to fill it a few times in order to fully clean out the colon, but if that works for you, great.

21:23:39&nbsp;
Karen
Thank you, I love your site:)

21:23:47&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, playing music keeps me very happy, except I want to be so much more knowledgeable than I am which causes a certain amount of internal angst.

21:23:56&nbsp;
kristina
Thank you, Karen!

21:24:17&nbsp;
kristina
What symptoms did you have? How are you now?

21:24:18&nbsp;
billythekid
I can't speak for all, but I don't think I can STAY SANE all the time. Anytime I let my emotions rule my intellect, I am not sane. I try to accept the fact that life is tough and I try not to take myself too seriously. I think that being a lifetime user of 

21:24:30&nbsp;
ELSIE
NEEDLESS TO SAY WE PARTED COMPANY.  BUT I HAVE TO THANK HER BECAUSE SHE IGNITED THE FUSE THAT MADE ME WANT TO LEARN MORE AND SEARCH FORTHE RIGHT ANSWERS FOR ME.

21:25:00&nbsp;
billythekid
Enemas have helped me maintain pretty good health. I don't get sick very often.

21:25:07&nbsp;
michael b
kristina, i have found raw colostrum in nevada and raw milk in calif. are they the same? both made by the same company.

21:25:39&nbsp;
Debbie
I want to colon cleanse because I want to make sure I don't have the old rope-like matter inside me 

21:25:41&nbsp;
kristina
You share such an important truth, that life is a path and every experience, even when things don't go as well as we could benefit from, we can still use it as a stepping stone to head in the direction of the most healing.

21:25:57&nbsp;
ELSIE
Kristina, what is your opinion of infrared saunas?  Good for extracting toxins?

21:26:34&nbsp;
kristina
Colostrum (also known as beestings or first milk) is a form of milk produced by the mammary glands in late pregnancy and the few days after giving birth.  Human and bovine colostrums are thick, sticky and yellowish. In humans, it has high concentrations of nutrients and antibodies, but it is small in quantity.

21:27:09&nbsp;
kristina
Bovine colostrum is sometimes used by humans as a dietary supplement. It has been attributed with curative powers and used as an ingredient in food dishes for the ill or invalid (Davidson, 1999). Purified bovine colostrum extract is also sometimes used in protein supplements used by athletes and bodybuilders.

21:27:49&nbsp;
Lisa
Kristina has an infrared sauna in her Optimal Health Center!

21:27:52&nbsp;
Karen
I would love to invest in your enema silicone bag that you promote on your site to do large volume enemas. What would be the difference with that and using the small plastic bucket that I use?

21:28:02&nbsp;
LoneEagle
I have found a colon therapist in my area but she is not I-ACT certified. Anything a should look for or talk to her about before I have a session with her?

21:28:19&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, on the FIR sauna. We have one at the office. I am hearing wonderful healing stories from folks who are using the sauna, even if they don't do the colon cleansing that we offer at the Optimal Health Center.

21:29:14&nbsp;
Joseph
The FIR sauna is great

21:29:23&nbsp;
ELSIE
 I use both the sauna and colon hydrotherapy treatments.

21:29:26&nbsp;
kristina
I believe that in order to give yourself a therapeutic colon cleanse, where you clear out the entire colon, you need to take in 3-4 quarts of water into the colon during one fill, usually during the second enema in the series.

21:29:48&nbsp;
kristina
Four quart enema bags allow you to do this easily without refilling your enema equipment. 

21:30:28&nbsp;
Karen
I believe it comes with a pump. What is that for?

21:30:50&nbsp;
billythekid
Hobbies are very important for emotional health. I have several. 

21:30:57&nbsp;
kristina
Another advantage to the silicone bag is that silicone is not thought to leech into the water whereas some people think there is a chance that plastic will leech into the body over time when using plastic enema equipment.

21:31:03&nbsp;
Lisa
When I was in Kristina's office, I had the works. I did the sauna, massage and a colonic. Boy, did I ever feel great after that! Another way to keep healthy and sane!

21:31:20&nbsp;
Carol45
Kristina, my farmer asked me if I wanted some colostrum when the goats were having kids.  Still new to goat's milk, I passed - would it have been a good idea to try some? There are no &quot;billies&quot;' and her neubien milk tastes very good. 

21:31:40&nbsp;
kristina
Ask her if she uses disposable tubing during the colon hydrotherapy session.

21:31:51&nbsp;
kristina
Ask her how many colonics she has given.

21:32:04&nbsp;
kristina
Ask her why she is a colon hydrotherapist.

21:32:13&nbsp;
kristina
Ask her why she isn't certified through I-ACT.

21:32:14&nbsp;
ELSIE
You might also want to ask where she was trained and by whom.

21:32:23&nbsp;
kristina
Excellent, Elsie

21:32:44&nbsp;
LoneEagle
Ok thanks all

21:32:49&nbsp;
Debbie
why do you think my colonics have so uncomfortable?

21:32:53&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, colostrum is a therapeutic food that I would take when I had the chance.

21:33:09&nbsp;
kristina
Do you have pain in your colon other than during a colonic?

21:33:16&nbsp;
ELSIE
Also what she is licensed to do and what she isn't.  Can she do implants or more importantly is she trained to do implants?

21:33:24&nbsp;
kristina
What type of colon hydrotherapy machine was used?

21:33:41&nbsp;
kristina
If I am missing anyone's question or input, let me know, please

21:34:03&nbsp;
kristina
Billy, what are your hobbies?

21:34:16&nbsp;
ELSIE
Instrument, Kristina, instrument!

21:34:27&nbsp;
kristina
Mine are piano, movies, being in nature on hikes...

21:34:40&nbsp;
kristina
thanks, Elsie

21:34:45&nbsp;
billythekid
Golf, reading and the New York Yankees!!!!!!

21:34:57&nbsp;
kristina
How did/are the Yankees doing?

21:35:00&nbsp;
kristina
What do you read?

21:35:15&nbsp;
kristina
Michael...

21:35:27&nbsp;
kristina
are you Michael T?

21:35:39&nbsp;
Debbie
no. I've seen 3 different therapists and they all used same machine. it looks similar to your picture online

21:35:50&nbsp;
kristina
Closed system?

21:35:58&nbsp;
kristina
Every time you had lots of discomfort?

21:35:59&nbsp;
billythekid
They are getting beat so bad tonight that I turned them off. Must keep my intellect in charge of my emotions, you know

21:36:01&nbsp;
kristina
Do you use enemas?

21:36:16&nbsp;
kristina
Sorry!

21:36:27&nbsp;
kristina
Are the Milwaukee Brewers still doing well?

21:36:55&nbsp;
Debbie
yes every time I don't last very long I run from the table. Yes I do enemas.  

21:37:00&nbsp;
kristina
Currently, I am listening to the Beatles. They are quite lovely.

21:37:10&nbsp;
billythekid
I think so, but I don't follow the National League that close.

21:37:12&nbsp;
kristina
Do the enemas bother you in the same way?

21:37:26&nbsp;
Debbie
Not as bad 

21:38:00&nbsp;
kristina
Infrared (IR) radiation is electromagnetic radiation of a wavelength longer than that of visible light, but shorter than that of radio waves. The radiation penetrates the body and heats through a process called conversion, instead of heating the air around you.

21:38:27&nbsp;
Debbie
But I was told enemas don't reach very far

21:38:44&nbsp;
kristina
Infrared sauna promoters state that infrared radiant heat is safe and beneficial, claiming that the heat penetrates more than 1.5 inches (40 mm) into the body. The argument is based on the idea that the wavelengths of far infrared waves are typically between 5.8 and 1000 micrometers. This is supposed to correspond to the vibration of the water molecule at 9.4 micrometers. Because these vibrations are similar, say promoters, the infrared rays help knock toxins loose from fat cells into the body, and those toxins are then released through sweating. They claim this heals and stimulates tissues, and that it is effective therapy for arthritis and tissue injuries.

21:38:56&nbsp;
ELSIE
Why is it that a person cannot tolerate enemas, but has no problem with colon hydrotherapy?  With an enema I cramp no matter how slowly I go, but there is no cramping or discomfort with the colon therapy.

21:39:04&nbsp;
kristina
Enemas, done well, will clean out the entire colon. I promise you.

21:39:47&nbsp;
Carol45
Absolutely!

21:40:03&nbsp;
Debbie
doesn't it cause sluggish colon - I'm afraid I'll never go natural again

21:40:11&nbsp;
billythekid
I will vouch for that!

21:40:27&nbsp;
billythekid
That is a myth!!!!

21:41:08&nbsp;
ELSIE
Debbie, it has been my experience that enemas and colon hydrotherapy sessions do not cause a sluggish colon.  It does just the opposite.

21:41:15&nbsp;
kristina
Who else here has used both colonics and enemas and can speak to each?

21:41:18&nbsp;
Lisa
Debbie, do you know about the OHN message board? We would love to have you there!

21:41:23&nbsp;
kristina
Enemas?

21:41:26&nbsp;
LoneEagle
Elsie, I have been told that colon hydrotherapy uses a much lower water pressure than enemas use. Is this true Kristina?

21:41:40&nbsp;
Karen
How to deeply cleanse the colon with the enemas. I have only been able to put a little water in and then I need to eliminate what was one of my previous meals. I have taken a break since I am not too sure this is good.

21:41:44&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, we would, Debbie!

21:42:02&nbsp;
kristina
No.

21:42:32&nbsp;
Carol45
How can one locate an infrared sauna in their area?  Is there a listing like I-ACT has?

21:43:11&nbsp;
kristina
Karen, we have a whole assortment of movies on how to take therapeutic enemas that will clear out the entire colon. The method is to take in a small amount of water and then to rest for a bit and then to take in a bit more water. 

21:43:21&nbsp;
ELSIE
The water pressure in an enema is as low or as high as you raise the bag - gravity.

21:43:45&nbsp;
kristina
You do this over and over again, until you have taken into your colon 2-4 quarts of water. Then you sit on the toilet, release all.

21:44:19&nbsp;
kristina
Then you take a second enema, filling only with a small amount of water, 1 tablespoon to 1 cup, per &quot;fill.&quot;

21:44:24&nbsp;
billythekid
The &quot;myth&quot; I referred to was that enemas would cause a sluggish colon. Just for the record.

21:44:50&nbsp;
kristina
After you do this for a few enema series, you learn what works best for your body. 

21:44:50&nbsp;
ELSIE
I can never make it to the toilet after even 1 qt.  I have a retention nozzle and even then I leak.  

21:45:07&nbsp;
Debbie
what if you have that rope-like matter - will it clear all that out?

21:45:10&nbsp;
kristina
Many people can then take more water all at once and still retain it for a 2-4 quart fill.

21:45:23&nbsp;
Lisa
Does anyone here have Kristina's video All About Enemas? It is the best video DVD out there on the subject!

21:45:28&nbsp;
kristina
Also, using the proper water can affect how well you can hold the enema solution.

21:45:34&nbsp;
LoneEagle
Elsie, is yours a single or a double?

21:45:42&nbsp;
kristina
You might need to use sea salt to assist you.

21:46:01&nbsp;
kristina
Peppermint, added to the enema bag and water, can also make a big difference.

21:46:07&nbsp;
ELSIE
I have all of her videos.  I've used sea salt and I've used peppermint.

21:46:11&nbsp;
Karen
Thank you. I did watch your large volume enema online. I am waiting until budget permits to purchase your video. Thank you for answering my questions!

21:46:34&nbsp;
Carol45
Kristina's videos are VERY helpful, even for those of us old timers.  Lisa, will you be performing in Berlin and/or Prague?

21:46:41&nbsp;
kristina
If you still can't figure it out, you might consider a hair tissue mineral analysis because it is possible that your electrolytes are imbalanced which is why you can't hold water.

21:46:56&nbsp;
ELSIE
Single retention nozzle. double too expensive for my cash flow right now.

21:47:11&nbsp;
kristina
Thanks, Carol. Might you comment on a particular skill you learned from watching one of the videos?

21:47:32&nbsp;
Debbie
how much sea salt? I have to confess eneamas scare while I'm doing it. I get panic attacks sometimes  

21:48:08&nbsp;
kristina
Elsie, after you take a 1 quart enema, can you then take more water on a second enema?

21:48:09&nbsp;
LoneEagle
A double might help - I have been told that the singles can actually work their way in deeper, then leaks are possible

21:49:06&nbsp;
Carol45
Using different nozzles and colon tubes for successive enemas in a series and lying on my right side for the largest fill.  Also found out I was trying to get the coffee enema up too high into my colon. 

21:49:22&nbsp;
kristina
The ropes come out only with product like our Vit-Ra-Tox kit or the Herbal Fiberblend. Also, I have laid out a 35-day plan that starts with dietary changes and ends with a five day nutritious liquids fast that will produce &quot;ropes&quot; and will leave you in a much stronger relationship with your body that will last you for a long time

21:49:34&nbsp;
ELSIE
Had hair analysis done a few months ago by you.  Nothing unusual.  No, on the more water on second enema.  Usually less.

21:49:44&nbsp;
kristina
Hey Jude... remember to let her into your heart and then you can start to make it better....

21:49:56&nbsp;
kristina
hey jude, don't be afraid...you were made to go out and get her....

21:50:12&nbsp;
kristina
hummm.....

21:50:15&nbsp;
Lisa
No, I won't be performing in Europe this time, but I do hope to get known there so I can! I will need to contact the right people to make that happen. And I will be meeting the right people.

21:50:28&nbsp;
Carol45
I'll be humming that all night!

21:50:47&nbsp;
kristina
Elsie, have you tried different water or some of the enema solutions other than just water?

21:51:21&nbsp;
kristina
hey jude....you can start to make it better, better, better, better....

21:51:38&nbsp;
kristina
Me, too, Carol. And, I will think of you and all the rest of you here, too!

21:51:52&nbsp;
Lisa
I like the song &quot;Imagine&quot; - Love the lyrics!!

21:52:26&nbsp;

I am sorry to all of you who tried to come to the last live chat that I missed. I just had too much going on. Thanks for coming back this month. How does this time work for folks?

The water I use is filtered well water and I have in the past used castile soap followed by salt, just plain water

Debbie, if you are new to enemas, be patient. You will find that it becomes an art form. They won't hurt you.

Debbie, do try to join us on the message board.  Everyone else here that isn't already on the board - we'd love to have you.

I love Imagine. I tried to learn it on the piano but gave up.

Hello

21:53:27&nbsp;
kristina
Yeah, and maybe folks can start posting on the board what they do to keep healthy, sane and happy. I will, too.

This time is good for me.  It's after my yoga practice instead of during it.  I won't give up the yoga, but love listening in on the chats.  It is past my bedtime of 9:00 EDT, but what the hey!  I'm learning something from all of you fine folks.

21:54:10&nbsp;

Excellent, we can all use some additional ideas I'm sure.

kristina, as you see, there are a lot of michaels and mikes but there are much  worse names. will there be a possibility of the large and small enemas on a dvd for the computer slow?

That &quot;welcome&quot; is something else.  I'm new to this whole approach to health and darned if I don't seem to have a latex allergy.  What a mess I am right now. Awaiting new equipment which I hope will have better results.  At least less.  

21:55:18&nbsp;
MIChopperGuy
looks like I missed it all

21:55:24&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, that is a good idea. Can you email me to remind me?

21:55:58&nbsp;
kristina
Also, I would love feedback on what other topics to cover as we could use one more short movie to fill out a DVD.

21:56:35&nbsp;

21:57:04&nbsp;
kristina
Itching?

21:57:28&nbsp;
carlisle63

21:57:34&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, we start at 8 pm, Central Standard Time.

21:57:49&nbsp;
kristina
No good. Sorry about that. Are you getting silicone enema equipment?

21:57:50&nbsp;
Carol45
Can't believe it's over all ready.  This time works very well.  Everyone have a good evening and month.  Condolences to Gail's friends and family. *choochoo* 

21:58:02&nbsp;
carlisle63
Yes.

21:58:19&nbsp;
kristina
Great. Let me know how that works for you. Itching where?

21:58:36&nbsp;
ELSIE
How do we email you?  Tried to do that a couple of times and didn't get anywhere.

21:58:40&nbsp;
billythekid
Bye bye everyone :D 

21:58:52&nbsp;
