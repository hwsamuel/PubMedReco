19:55:14&nbsp;
Dave
Dave signing on. get my e-mails, Kris?

19:55:59&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, I did Dave. But I haven't had time to look into the issue.

19:56:20&nbsp;
Dave
Fine, just wanted to make sure they got there.

19:56:46&nbsp;
bhtimm
Hi Kristina

19:56:48&nbsp;
billythekid
Good Evening from the Bowels of the South 

19:56:49&nbsp;
bhtimm
this is Heidi

19:57:08&nbsp;
kristina
Thanks. I appreciate you letting me know about what happened at the conference. I still don't know anything about it. Please do tell us here, if you wish and if you know any of the details.

19:57:16&nbsp;
kristina
Hello bhtimm

19:57:24&nbsp;
kristina
Hi Heidi

19:57:30&nbsp;
Dave
Welcome Heidi.

19:57:30&nbsp;
kristina
And, hello to everyone else.

19:57:52&nbsp;
kristina
Glad you can join us, Heidi. How is everything going?

19:58:22&nbsp;
bhtimm
the colonic with Dee Dee went OK...I was a little sorer this time but I think it's been because I was off the Alli x 2 weeks.

19:58:55&nbsp;
bhtimm
the tube was over the area of rectal inflammation...after a while I had to ask her to take the tube out for a bit.  Then I got the coffee

19:59:23&nbsp;
bhtimm
she recommended an olive oil/MSM implant

19:59:53&nbsp;
kristina
The implant is an excellent idea. Were you aware of any colon inflammation before you had the colonic?

20:00:02&nbsp;
kristina
How did you feel afterward?

20:00:20&nbsp;
Dave
Just briefly, it was reported that 140 or so conference attendees came down with suspected norovirus - 24 hours in the bathroom. unsure how it happened.

20:00:44&nbsp;
bhtimm
I was telling Dee Dee about it...and you too but I can refresh your memory...It happened 12 years ago when I was a college student.  I had a really bad diet at the time and had a stool so hard it ripped the rectal mucosa and had a bright red stool...

20:00:46&nbsp;
kristina
Hi Carol.

20:00:49&nbsp;
Dave
Nice turnout so far.

20:01:10&nbsp;
Carol45
*choochoo*  Hi everyone.

20:01:18&nbsp;
bhtimm
from that point on I've had issues on and off, from 2001-2005 off and on used hydrocortisone / triple antibiotic over the area to attempt to self-treat

20:02:34&nbsp;
kristina
 Norovirus Viral Gastroenteritis &gt; Norovirus  Noroviruses (genus Norovirus, family Caliciviridae) are a group of related, single-stranded RNA, nonenveloped viruses that cause acute gastroenteritis in humans. Norovirus was recently approved as the official genus name for the group of viruses provisionally described as “Norwalk-like viruses” (NLV). 

20:03:16&nbsp;
kristina
We are talking about the Weston A. Price conference that happened this past weekend. 

20:03:18&nbsp;
Dave
That's apparently the critter. Seems to happen on cruise ships too.

20:03:26&nbsp;
Carol45
I almost forgot it was chat night. 

20:03:31&nbsp;
kristina
Heidi,

20:03:33&nbsp;
bhtimm
I did have a bout of gastroenteritis, too - so Dee Dee noticed my stool color was light

20:03:37&nbsp;
bhtimm
yes

20:03:48&nbsp;
bhtimm
probably w/Norovirus

20:04:13&nbsp;
kristina
What I am asking is, Was your anal area inflamed in the hours or days before you came for the colonic?

20:04:41&nbsp;
bhtimm
no, actually since I emailed you last it had seemed to be steadily improving.

20:04:48&nbsp;
Denise
Hi everyone I had a really hard time entering

20:04:50&nbsp;
Lisa
Hello everyone!

20:04:54&nbsp;
bhtimm
the raw milk butyrate seemed to be kicking in

20:05:07&nbsp;
Dave
Hello Lisa, world traveler.

20:05:07&nbsp;
kristina
 I don't know why but the reminder  didn't go out. 

20:05:20&nbsp;
kristina
Hi Denise. Welcome

20:05:31&nbsp;
bhtimm
perhaps it just got sore because the water pressure from the colonic was right over it

20:05:32&nbsp;
Denise
Thank you

20:05:49&nbsp;
Lisa
I just got back from a wonderful trip to Berlin Germany!

20:05:53&nbsp;
kristina
Great. so its seems to you that the colonic itself triggered the soreness?

20:06:02&nbsp;
bhtimm
possibly

20:06:06&nbsp;
kristina
Wow, Lisa. Welcome back. How was your trip?

20:06:27&nbsp;
Carol45
Glad you're back safe and sound Lisa.

20:06:43&nbsp;
Lisa
The trip was exciting, but cold! When in Prague, it was two degrees!!

20:06:43&nbsp;
Carol45
What went on at the Price conference?

20:07:05&nbsp;
Denise
Kristina did you go to the conference?

20:07:24&nbsp;
Lisa
Thanks Carol45!

20:07:26&nbsp;
Dave
A possible seasonal topic tonight. What is best enema solution for dealing with colds, flu? i read somewhere it's salt/baking soda.

20:07:38&nbsp;
Denise
I downloaded Sally Fallon's talk on my mp3 from 2006 and it was very informative

20:08:16&nbsp;
Lisa
Great question Dave! I had a pretty bad cold now. Not surprising.

20:08:40&nbsp;
kristina
I didn't go to the conference. I was at a co-counseling conference in Western Wisconsin, which was absolutely fabulous.

20:08:45&nbsp;
Carol45
Their 'cookbook' is a wealth of information!

20:08:59&nbsp;
michael b
let me wish every one and their families a great thanksgiving

20:09:08&nbsp;
kristina
Seems that 140 people who were at the conference came down with a gastrointestinal discomfort.

20:09:15&nbsp;
Denise
I liked hearing about the different people Dr. Price visited and the information he gathered about their health

20:09:32&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, the work of the Weston A. Price Foundation is absolutely fabulous. 

20:09:35&nbsp;
Denise
Oh I'm glad I did not go.  Why did they get sick

20:09:37&nbsp;
Lisa
Thanks Michael, and same to you!!

20:09:41&nbsp;
billythekid
I have used salt and baking soda solution for many years with no problems. At my age I still feel compelled to take advantage of the Flu Shot which I have done for years and years-again with no problems

20:10:03&nbsp;
kristina
I have written much about it in my book, Ten Days to Optimal Health. You can also learn lots on their website. 

20:10:16&nbsp;
bhtimm
I've decided not to take the flu shot this year - a brave thing being I work in a hospital!

20:10:19&nbsp;
Carol45
We've got some kind of a stomach upset and fever going on in our area. 

20:10:31&nbsp;
Denise
Yes I have your book also and find it very informative and see that they support your work also

20:10:34&nbsp;
kristina
The cookbook is Nourishing Traditions by Sally Fallon. Sally Fallon is the person who has grown the WAPF to where it is today.

20:10:49&nbsp;
kristina
Thank you, Michael.

20:11:28&nbsp;
bhtimm
I am a pharmacist so I have a lot of sources claiming the thimerosal is insignificant - I don't believe that.  What about cumulative toxicity?

20:11:50&nbsp;
bhtimm
you have to get the shot every year

20:11:55&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, Dr. Price's book is called Nutrition and Physical Degeneration  

20:12:55&nbsp;
kristina
Heidi, tell us all you know about vaccines, if you would be so kind

20:13:34&nbsp;
Dave
Sort of ironic it happened at a nutrition conference, but apparently wasn't linked to food since there were 1,200 there.

20:13:43&nbsp;
bhtimm
well I would actually like to know more about what I don't know...for example, the potential risks of getting them year after year

20:14:09&nbsp;
bhtimm
my Pharmacist's Letter cites that 20% of Americans will get influenza in any given year...I find that hard to believe

20:14:25&nbsp;
kristina
So, they think it wasn't what they ate but that those 140 would have gotten sick anyway?

20:15:01&nbsp;
kristina
Dr. Mercola writes a lot about vaccinnes. I don't recommend them.

20:15:09&nbsp;
bhtimm
I did get my mercury fillings taken out by a caring dentist who is now retired.

20:15:11&nbsp;
billythekid
I agree that is a very high percentage - one in five!

20:15:21&nbsp;
Carol45
I have heard that what a lot of people think is flu is actually a case of food 'poisoning'.

20:15:21&nbsp;
bhtimm
That is why my mercury was not too bad on my hair analysis

20:15:42&nbsp;
bhtimm
right...it's not the respiratory virus...many many people are miseducated about that

20:15:58&nbsp;
bhtimm
i mean that influenze A IS a respiratory virus

20:16:02&nbsp;
Dave
All I know is what was said on TV, and one participant said it wasn't food. Nothing on the Price web site earlier today.

20:16:13&nbsp;
kristina
Here are a couple of good reads - &quot;What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Childhood Vaccinations&quot; by Stephanie Cave; &quot;Just a Little Prick&quot; by Peter and Hilary Butler

20:16:37&nbsp;
bhtimm
we are growing an herb garden w/fresh cilantro - which is a great mercury detoxer.  I've been throwing some in with my juicer

20:17:02&nbsp;
bhtimm
Kristina - I use my Magic Bullet to &quot;juice up&quot; my salads, since all you were seeing on my colonic were &quot;chunks&quot;

20:17:08&nbsp;
bhtimm
I also eat the pulp.

20:17:09&nbsp;
kristina
Excellent idea. I would also recommend chlorella.

20:17:39&nbsp;
Carol45
Last year I had started on my raw goat's milk and kefir.  Haven't had a flu shot in two years - and I feel better. 

20:17:46&nbsp;
kristina
For those who want to get a flu shot, they do come thermisol free

20:17:52&nbsp;
bhtimm
exactly what metals does chorella chelate?  I've been looking and can't find it

20:18:02&nbsp;
bhtimm
Flumist is also thimerosal-free

20:18:02&nbsp;
kristina
This is great news, Carol. How is the job coming along?

20:18:08&nbsp;
bhtimm
(the nasal spray)

20:18:51&nbsp;
bhtimm
I love goat cheese - next best thing to raw milk cheese which I plan on buying from Dr. Mercola's site soon

20:19:17&nbsp;
bhtimm
I have read that even if goat milk is pasteurized, it doesn't suffer the same structural damage to proteins the way cow's milk does

20:19:20&nbsp;
kristina
 Chlorella appears particularly helpful at eliminating toxic metals like cadmium and uranium from the body. 

20:19:20&nbsp;
Lisa
I'm going to cut out early tonight. I'm really not feeling well. I'm drinking lots of orange juice for this cold. I just want to get into bed now. I'll chat with you all on the mesage board.

20:19:28&nbsp;
michael b
a lot of people have have vaccinations over decades, seldom do they say how long they last.

20:19:34&nbsp;
Carol45
I am FINALLY down to part time hours AND someone else will be Office Manager!  Felt better almost immediately.  Will be only part time until a co-worker's husband is doing better and she returns to work full time. 

20:19:36&nbsp;
bhtimm
and it doesn't have to be homogenized, the fat globules are too small

20:19:55&nbsp;
kristina
Rest well, Lisa. Thanks for poking your head in to say, &quot;hello!&quot;

20:20:09&nbsp;
bhtimm
I have been feeling still this low-energy myself - I think it's my body releasing copper.

20:20:27&nbsp;
kristina
You can get raw milk cheese locally from us and the Willy St. Coop and Whole Foods. 

20:20:32&nbsp;
bhtimm
I feel pretty good now, but have been struggling more with insomnia

20:20:53&nbsp;
Lisa
Thanks Kris! Goodbye for now!

20:20:54&nbsp;
bhtimm
Whole Foods - I looked there, couldn't find any raw milk cheese.  Didn't think it was legal to sell

20:21:09&nbsp;
Dave
Wisconsin is OK with raw milk cheese sold commercially?

20:21:14&nbsp;
kristina
Yeah, Carol. This is good news. I am so glad to hear this. 

20:21:16&nbsp;
Carol45
Hope you feel better soon.  Now that my life looks like it is getting regulated, I'll join you again on the message board - I've missed you all. 

20:21:20&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, Whole Foods.

20:21:35&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, you can buy raw cheese at many grocery stores in WI

20:22:03&nbsp;
kristina
Heidi,

20:22:25&nbsp;
Dave
I had thought the big dairy industry would fight it.   

20:22:28&nbsp;
kristina
Have you thought about the saliva testing because we would be able to look directly at your cortisol levels throughout your circadian rhythm

20:23:04&nbsp;
kristina
The adrenal rhythm and its importance: The human adrenal gland does not secrete its steroid hormones at a constant level throughout the day. The hormones are actually released in a cycle with the highest value in the morning and the lowest value at night.

20:23:18&nbsp;
bhtimm
i may have to hold off for now...my husband is frustrated with how much we've had in bills with various things.  I'm looking at doing the fasting protocol first week of December

20:23:24&nbsp;
kristina
An abnormal adrenal rhythm can influence many functions of the body:

20:23:39&nbsp;
kristina
Sleep quality: the ability to enter REM sleep cycles, i.e. regenerative sleep, is interrupted by high cortisol values at night and in the morning. Chronic lack of REM sleep can reduce the mental vitality and vigor of a person and induce depression.

20:24:00&nbsp;
bhtimm
right...I did have my cortisol done about six months ago, there didn't seem to be a problem except the fact that it dropped off too quickly from morning to noon

20:24:14&nbsp;
kristina
I understand.

20:24:15&nbsp;
bhtimm
cortisol was low-normal at bedtime

20:24:16&nbsp;
Carol45
I am SO looking forward to getting my saliva test done.

20:24:41&nbsp;
bhtimm
did you find out the results of yours Kristina?  I know you were asking me about what the ideal times for taking it were.

20:24:42&nbsp;
billythekid
Kristina, what size tubing do you sell besides 5/16 inch if any?

20:24:42&nbsp;
kristina
More on saliva testing...  Energy production - Abnormal adrenal function can alter the ability of cells to produce energy for activities of daily living. People who have a hard time rising in the morning, or who suffer with a low energy level during the day, often have abnormal adrenal rhythms and poor blood sugar regulation.  The maintenance of a stable blood sugar level depends on food choice, lifestyle, adrenal function and insulin activity. This panel measures stress hormones and insulin, to help ferret out causes of fatigue, cravings and obesity. 

20:24:52&nbsp;
kristina
Muscle and joint function - Abnormal adrenal rhythms are known to compromise tissue healing. Reduced tissue repair and increased tissue breakdown can lead to muscle and joint breakdown with chronic pain.

20:25:05&nbsp;
michael b
 Carol45, were you born before august 15, one of the last of the war babies?

20:25:12&nbsp;
kristina
Immune health - Various immune cells (white blood cells) cycle in and out of the spleen and bone marrow for special conditioning, and possible nourishment and instructions. This immune system trafficking follows the cortisol cycle. So, if the cycle is disrupted, especially at night, then the immune system is adversely affected. Short and long-term stress is known to suppress the immune response on the surfaces of our body as in lungs, throat, urinary and intestinal tract. With the reduction in the surface antibody (called secretory IgA), the resistance to infection is reduced and allergic reactions are believed to increase.

20:25:33&nbsp;
bhtimm
I think my copper release is actually in result of increased adrenal activity - I have read that improved adrenal function facilitates the excretion of copper.

20:26:01&nbsp;
bhtimm
If I drink my licorice tea now, I actually feel WORSE - but for a long time, it was a natural, coffee-free pick-me-up.

20:26:08&nbsp;
bhtimm
caffeine-free I should say

20:26:32&nbsp;
kristina
All of our tubing is 5/16&quot;. However, some of it is more flexible than others.

20:26:53&nbsp;
billythekid
Thank you.

20:27:13&nbsp;
Carol45
Michael B, I was born in May.  It looks like Kristina is writing my life story!!

20:27:37&nbsp;
Dave
The latex tubing seems especially flexible and adaptable.

20:28:05&nbsp;
Denise
Sorry I got a phone call, I hope I didn't miss much

20:28:28&nbsp;
Denise
I am looking forward to the Sylvia results also

20:28:35&nbsp;
bhtimm
Kristina I found a legit way to have my ice cream and eat it too!  We have an ice cream maker, and can use raw milk and natural sweetener to make our own ice cream!!

20:28:42&nbsp;
kristina
Heidi, What stage of copper release do you think you are?

20:28:51&nbsp;
Carol45
Kristina, I hope this get printed in the board.  I know I will want to re-read all about the testing. 

20:29:05&nbsp;
bhtimm
I have no idea...we'll have to see with a repeat hair test in 3 mos

20:29:25&nbsp;
bhtimm
it makes me wonder if I had a hidden copper toxicity before

20:29:25&nbsp;
Dave
Did I miss an answer as to best enema ingredients for cold/flu?

20:29:31&nbsp;
kristina
Excellent, Heidi. Raw milk ice cream is very tasty.

20:29:50&nbsp;
kristina
What do you mean, Carol, by I am writing your life story? I missed that.

20:29:51&nbsp;
bhtimm
by the way...Dr Mercola cites this Dr. L . Wilson so I assume he is a very good authority on hair analysis

20:30:13&nbsp;
billythekid
I have been using 1/4&quot; tubing for my more recent enemas and have found a much higher comfort level as far as volume, retention and lack of leakage is concerned.  

20:30:37&nbsp;
Carol45
I have tried to make ice cream out of goat's milk.  It turned out good, but I used Rapidura.  Has anyone tried to use vegetable glycerine?

20:30:40&nbsp;
Denise
Is raw cheese that is aged for 60 days still considered raw? and does it still have the good enzyme content?

20:30:50&nbsp;
kristina
We plan to launch our new www.optimalhealthnetwork.com over the next month. We will post all the past live chats after that.

20:31:00&nbsp;
bhtimm
More info on copper toxicity

20:31:18&nbsp;
kristina
In the meantime, you can read more about the saliva testing at http://www.diagnostechs.com/main.htm

20:31:25&nbsp;
Carol45
Kristina, all of the ill effects from adrenal being out of whack. 

20:31:31&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, and yes to Denise

20:31:46&nbsp;
Denise
thanks

20:33:12&nbsp;
michael b
kristina, do you read music as well as you type?

20:33:27&nbsp;
kristina
many children are born with excessive tissue copper.  It is passed from high-copper mothers to their children through the placenta. 

20:33:34&nbsp;
Carol45
Billythekid, is your 1/4&quot; tubing silicone?

20:33:35&nbsp;
Denise
Why are the weston a price people against eating raw egg whites

20:33:48&nbsp;
kristina
Got it, Carol. 

20:33:49&nbsp;
billythekid
No

20:33:59&nbsp;
bhtimm
Kristina did you see too that the high copper in extremes can lead to schizophrenia?  That's exactly what my mother's got!

20:34:10&nbsp;
kristina
Michael - yes and no

20:34:20&nbsp;
kristina
I do read music but not as proficiently as I type.

20:34:29&nbsp;
kristina
I am devouring my piano music these days.

20:34:40&nbsp;
kristina
I love it and I am getting better and better at it.

20:34:54&nbsp;
kristina
Recently, I feel in love with piano works by Chopin.

20:35:00&nbsp;
Dave
Lisa will be pleased to hear that, kristina.

20:35:19&nbsp;
bhtimm
I have another article about the link between high copper and postpartum depression - I can't paste it here, but I'll try to remember to print it off for you and bring it into my next appointment.

20:35:20&nbsp;
Denise
They say that egg yolks are okay raw but to cook the whites?

20:35:59&nbsp;
Denise
Do you know why or where I can get more information on this?

20:37:00&nbsp;
kristina
Great, Heidi. Thanks.

20:37:10&nbsp;
Carol45
Heidi, how much natural sweetener do you use in your ice cream?

20:39:06&nbsp;
Carol45
Dave, on your baking soda enema for the cold and flu season - how much do you use?

20:40:37&nbsp;
kristina
Some people think that eating too many egg whites - 2, 3, 4 or more daily - might contribute to a biotin deficiency

20:40:54&nbsp;
Dave
Haven't tried it, just asking for Kristina and others' opinion and experience at this point. Assume it'd be 2 quarts.

20:41:18&nbsp;
Carol45
How much soda?

20:41:31&nbsp;
kristina
The idea here is that egg yolks are extremely good for you so you might want to eat 2 or more daily but that the whites aren't as good. I am not sure what I think at this point.

20:41:43&nbsp;
kristina
You can find out more on www.mercola.com

20:41:58&nbsp;
billythekid
I can tell you that I use the regular amount of celtic salt and I add 3 or 4 heaping teaspoons of the baking soda.

20:42:04&nbsp;
kristina
2-4 quarts of water 

20:42:20&nbsp;
kristina
I missed Dave's question, can you post again?

20:42:29&nbsp;
Carol45
:p  Glad you said baking soda - the other kind would be awfully fizzy!

20:42:37&nbsp;
billythekid
I use 2 qts.

20:43:23&nbsp;
Dave
Wanted to know if salt/soda enema is good for cold/flu or a different ingredient and amount.

20:44:12&nbsp;
kristina
I would also add coffee at the end for a cold or flu

20:44:41&nbsp;
kristina
Is Lisa a fan of Chopin?

20:44:52&nbsp;
michael b
Adrien Brody plays a Chopin piece in the movie The Pianist. He really learned it - no double.

20:44:53&nbsp;
Denise
I think  Mercola is for raw eggs, but the weston a price people are not for raw whites.  Mercola used to agree but finds now that the whites raw are necessary as well.  Hard to know what to do

20:45:07&nbsp;
Denise
I eat one raw egg per day in my shakes

20:45:37&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, lots of different information. I will keep my eyes open on that one, Denise.

20:45:50&nbsp;
kristina
Lately, I eat 2-4 eggs most days.

20:45:51&nbsp;
billythekid
I don't know, but I would think that as long as the colon is kept clean on a regular and frequent basis during the flu and cold season that what you use would not be that important. My use of baking soda goes back to my childhood days.

20:46:17&nbsp;
Denise
Are the 2-4 eggs raw?

20:46:28&nbsp;
kristina
1 Teaspoon of celtic sea salt per quart. Same on the baking soda, but this level I am less certain.

20:46:35&nbsp;
kristina
both raw and cooked

20:46:45&nbsp;
Dave
So I could start off with salt/soda or do a soap suds first in the series and finish with the coffee implant as we've done?

20:46:52&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, Dave.

20:47:29&nbsp;
Denise
I have been cooking my eggs sunny side up so the yolk is raw and white cooked, I will try to research more on this also...

20:48:30&nbsp;
Denise
Is baking soda okay for enemas, not sure if I saw that information on your site Kristina?

20:48:35&nbsp;
billythekid
The baking soda will leave a residue inside the bag after the enema and it is ok to let it stay there for a while. It protects the bag from bacteria or so I have been told. 

20:48:42&nbsp;
Carol45
The coffee makes a big difference in my overall health.  With the 'bug' season upon us, I am definitely going to get back into my routine of regular series with coffee at least 4 -5 times a week.

20:48:46&nbsp;
kristina
Here is what WAPF says about egg whites:

20:48:47&nbsp;

consumption of raw egg whites on a regular basis can lead to digestive problems. The problem is not, as Dr. Mercola states, that raw egg whites can cause biotin deficiency, but that raw egg whites contain enzyme inhibitors that can interfere with protein digestion. Whole eggs should be cooked--and it is fine to cook them any way you like them, even scrambled. Beating or whipping eggs does not damage the proteins or cause the cholesterol to oxidize, as Mercola has suggested.

Don't know Lisa's current favorite, but it was Mozart last year. Chopin was big in Warsaw, as you might expect, when I was there.

Sometime back Kristina asked for some input on the Board about the use of baking soda enemas, but I don't remember where it is in the dorums.

If anyone knows could you put it in the chat forums?

I can only repeat that I have never had a problem using baking soda in the solution. I don't use with all of my enemas.

I think cold/flu season was a time for more enemas, at least when some of us were kids.

For those of us who were likely to be more constipated, that was definitely the case.

Costipation and flu-bed  seemed to go together, thus an enema.
