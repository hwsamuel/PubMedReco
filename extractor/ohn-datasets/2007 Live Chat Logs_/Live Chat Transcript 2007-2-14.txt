Happy Valentine's Day!

17:57:10&nbsp;

Hi all

17:57:17&nbsp;
Lisa
Hi everyone! I can make it today because of V Day - my student canceled because she was going out with her husband. So I'm free to be here today!

17:58:12&nbsp;
kristina
I am very pleased that you are here today, Lisa. And, you too, Mike! Lucky me that I get to spend a bit of time on Valentine's Day with you all!

17:59:39&nbsp;
Lisa
The same student canceled last month, so I get to make it to the chat twice in a row!

17:59:59&nbsp;
kristina
One of the subjects that I would like to discuss today is colon tubes.

18:00:32&nbsp;
kristina
As some of you may have noticed, I am now offering a stiffer colon tube in silicone, 70 durometer. The old silicone colon tube was only a 50 durometer colon tube. 

18:00:47&nbsp;
LoneEagle
Hello all

18:00:49&nbsp;
kristina
I did this because of input from colon tube users.

18:01:26&nbsp;
kristina
I am also now considering developing a new silicone colon tube.

18:02:12&nbsp;
Mike K
Do you feel this new tube is easier to insert?

18:02:24&nbsp;
bbholl
hi guys! :)

18:02:34&nbsp;
LoneEagle
Hi BB

18:02:53&nbsp;
kristina
The features of this colon tube will be a larger FR-40 or so, with a removable tip so that the colon tube is much easier to clean and can be used to drain the first part of the colon, or the ascending colon.

18:03:04&nbsp;
bbholl
it's been a while since I've been able to chat (schedule conflicts)

18:03:24&nbsp;
kristina
Additionally, this colon tube will allow an easy insertion deep into the colon. 

18:03:37&nbsp;
kristina
Your thoughts?

18:03:39&nbsp;
kristina
positive or negative?

18:04:07&nbsp;
bbholl
sorry, which colon tube are we talking about?

18:04:26&nbsp;
bbholl
Kristina, what lube do you recommend?

18:04:29&nbsp;
kristina
A colon tube I am considering producing and offering at the OHN.

18:04:38&nbsp;
bbholl
ok, thanks!

18:04:59&nbsp;
LoneEagle
I think it will be a good item - flexible enough not to cause damage but stiff enough so it will not coil or turn back

18:05:17&nbsp;
bbholl
is this tube larger than normal?

18:05:31&nbsp;
bbholl
sorry, I don't know much about these tubes

18:05:34&nbsp;
bbholl
yet

18:06:08&nbsp;
kristina
Super Salve is my lubricant of choice, although it is the most difficult to clean up from.

18:06:26&nbsp;
bbholl
what about KY jelly?

18:06:42&nbsp;
kristina
I also recommend coconut oil

18:07:17&nbsp;
kristina
The idea with both of these lubricants is that they are therapeutic to the anal area as well as viscous for an easy and safe nozzle insertion.

18:08:14&nbsp;
LoneEagle
Speaking of colon tubes, what is the best way to clean the bottom end of a closed opening tube?

18:08:19&nbsp;
Lisa
I don't know why, but I sometimes burn and itch when I use KY jelly. Super Salve is great!

18:08:37&nbsp;
kristina
Surgilube and the like work fine, but they don't nourish the body while they lubricate.

18:08:46&nbsp;
bbholl
is it ok to use, though?

18:08:50&nbsp;
bbholl
KY that is

18:09:38&nbsp;
Lisa
KY is fine for most people.

18:09:39&nbsp;
kristina
Clean the tube immediately after use with very hot, soapy water. Use the force of the water to clean. Eye up the tube to make sure all fecal matter has been removed. This is another reason that silicone is a better choice for colon tubes, because you can see into the tube.

18:09:53&nbsp;
kristina
Then, if needed, you can use a pipe cleaner. 

18:10:09&nbsp;
michael b
i would like to wish a wonderful valentine's day to all

18:11:06&nbsp;
kristina
Follow all of this cleaning up with a soak in Grapefruit Seed Extract and hot water for 10-30 minutes.

18:11:33&nbsp;
Lisa
Thank you, Michael! I hope you are having a great Valentine's Day too!

18:12:31&nbsp;
kristina
Don't use a toxic commercial soap, as the chemicals will end up in your body. Stick to Dr. Bronner's Lavender Castile Soap, as it is antiseptic and will clean your equipment without toxic residue.

18:12:52&nbsp;
Elsie
Good evening, all.  Kristina, I haven't forgotten about temperatures and the hair analysis.  The temps are so low that I figure on taking them again.  I'm beginning to wonder if I'm alive! 

18:13:36&nbsp;
Elsie
The hair will have to wait because I have to let it grow out.  I wear it very short.

18:13:42&nbsp;
kristina
I would also add a few extra drops of lavender essential oil to increase the antibacterial and antifungal action of your cleaner

18:14:02&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, KY Jelly is fine to use.

18:14:49&nbsp;
Lisa
Is there a reason why you use lavender, Kristina? What about peppermint?

18:15:12&nbsp;
kristina
But what I notice after years of working with people as their colon hydrotherapist is that the anus tends to get looser and looser and thus retaining enemas gets more and more difficult. I think that there is great benefit from using the therapeutic lubricants.

18:15:46&nbsp;
kristina
With cleaning, lavender provides more antifungal and antibacterial benefits than peppermint does.

18:16:14&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, I am continually amazed at how low most people's temperatures are. 

18:16:24&nbsp;
Lisa
Oh, I see. Thanks!

18:16:42&nbsp;
bbholl
what does Super Salve do, exactly, that makes it therapeutic?

18:16:46&nbsp;
kristina
If I missed anything, please do feel free to post again as this is an active board!

18:17:55&nbsp;
kristina
Super salve is a food. It contains: Olive Oil, Organic Chaparral Leaf, Organic Comfrey Leaf, Organic Echinacea Flower, Organic Hops, Organic Usnea Moss, Organic Bee's Wax, Cocoa Butter, and Vitamin E and Almond Oils. Essential Oils of Cajuput, Lemon Grass, Lemon, Lavender, and Tea tree

18:18:45&nbsp;
kristina
The herbs and oils within Super Salve keep bacteria levels low so there is less risk of infection while taking enemas.

18:19:01&nbsp;
michael b
i have used aloe vera gel, and i have seen cuttings from live plants heal nasty cuts.

18:19:46&nbsp;
kristina
The herbs and oils within Super Salve keep fungal levels down so that there is less chance of skin irritations on the anal area as well as in the rectum.

18:20:11&nbsp;
kristina
I have seen Super Salve both reduce and eliminate hemorroids.

18:20:21&nbsp;
bbholl
makes sense

18:20:44&nbsp;
bbholl
I'll look for it next time I shop at your store

18:20:47&nbsp;
kristina
Aloe Vera gel has similar properties to the ingredients in Super Salve. I find it to be less viscous, but certainly easier to clean up.

18:20:51&nbsp;
kristina
Thanks.

18:21:29&nbsp;
Elsie
I've used super salve for cuts and abrasions on the grandchildren instead of an antibacterial ointment.

18:21:58&nbsp;
Winc
are tubes good for removing gas?

18:22:00&nbsp;
kristina
We do have scales for the hair analysis that we can send out so you can be accurate about how much hair we really need. You would be surprised at how little hair it takes.

18:22:29&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, colon tubes can be wonderful for removing gas. 

18:23:01&nbsp;
kristina
Anyone have thoughts on the possible upcoming colon tube design? Or on how they would like to see their colon tube experience improved upon?

18:23:08&nbsp;
Elsie
I have the scale and have also had two hair analyses done in the past.  It takes more than what I thought.

18:23:31&nbsp;
sue_jance
hello, I'm Susan. I'm new to colonics, but I read your website and I want to know if it's good for me.

18:23:32&nbsp;
Winc
Most of my concerns is to avoid perforation

18:23:45&nbsp;
kristina
I guess your hair is short, short. I am always surprised at how little hair a HTMA takes, but my hair is long.

18:23:46&nbsp;
bbholl
kristina, I've been looking at this enema bag

18:23:50&nbsp;
Elsie
And more than I have.  1/4 inch on the sides and back doesn't give you a whole lot of head to work with.

18:23:56&nbsp;
bbholl
is this a good one for a beginner?

18:24:01&nbsp;
kristina
Hi Susan. Welcome!

18:24:44&nbsp;
kristina
Susan, what are your goals for your health that have brought you to considering colon cleansing?

18:26:09&nbsp;
sue_jance
I suffer from chronic abdominal pain - maybe gallstones - but can't do the flush until I do the colon cleanse. I am constipated. Sometimes no stool comes out. What do you recommend? I'm 50 years old from the Philippines.

18:27:55&nbsp;
kristina
bbholl, I can't seem to follow that link. Can you tell me the name and/or sku of the bag you are referring to?

18:27:55&nbsp;
michael b
from looking at the 70&quot;, hardness seems like a good idea.

18:28:53&nbsp;
sue_jance
 I am scared of colonics because I read that it could also cause damage. I suspect that something is wrong with my intestines too. I need your guidance. Thanks. Is it possible to contact you by phone later?

18:28:58&nbsp;
Mike K
Kris it's the 4 Quart Easy Enema with Flex Tip

18:29:37&nbsp;
bbholl
thanks, Mike K

18:29:52&nbsp;
bbholl
I just read Kristina's reply

18:30:09&nbsp;
kristina
I recommend that you work through the 35-day plan that is within my book, Kristina Amelong's Ten Days to Optimal Health. This colon cleanse program will effectively prepare your body for the gallbladder cleanse. I can't tell you how many people I see get sicker from a gallbladder cleanse if they have not first improved the body's detoxification abilities with dietary changes and a few well-placed colon cleanse sessions.

18:30:32&nbsp;
Mike K
my opinion is that it's a great bag for starter kit

18:31:10&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, you can call my office to set up a phone consultation. I am very confident that you can get your health back to where you want it to be.

18:31:33&nbsp;
bbholl
thanks, Mike K :)

18:31:43&nbsp;
Winc
I would suggest a transparent bag and hose so one can see how it's going 

18:31:44&nbsp;
kristina
To learn more about the services that I offer, you can go to our services menu or you can call my office at 608-242-0200. I am not sure what country code you might need to use.

18:32:13&nbsp;
bbholl
the sku number is 124

18:32:45&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, the 4 Quart Easy Enema with Flex Tip is a perfect starter bag. It will also prove to be an excellent bag as you mature in your enema practice because of its four quart capacity.

18:32:45&nbsp;
bbholl
I think the U.S. country code is +1

18:33:09&nbsp;
bbholl
thanks, Kristina

18:33:14&nbsp;
Elsie
Sue_jance, there is nothing to fear but fear itself.  I was also told that colonics would destroy my body.  That was 3 years ago, and I'm glad I did research and decided to ignore my primary care physician's advice and took colonics.

18:33:33&nbsp;
kristina
Transparent is also an excellent idea. However, there is a lack of option in the transparent bag, which is one of my goals to correct.

18:34:05&nbsp;
kristina
We do have two inexpensive transparent enema bags, the 1500cc and the 2500cc bags.

18:34:32&nbsp;
kristina
From there you have the 4 quart silicone bag, which costs a lot more but will last a lifetime and is completely non-toxic.

18:36:00&nbsp;
sue_jance
What time are you available for a call? Yes I believe in colonics but i need the proper way of doing it. That's why I need your personal advice. I have a friend in the USA who can purchase products from your company and bring it here. How soon will the product come to the Philippines?

18:36:15&nbsp;
kristina
The 6 quart amber is also translucent

18:36:55&nbsp;
kristina
Thanks, Elsie. I would love to have others speak to their colon cleanse experience and how it has improved their health.

18:37:32&nbsp;
sue_jance
I mean how soon will the product reach the Philippines if I order it personally? A friend from the USA will be here next neek. Maybe it would be faster though her?

18:38:32&nbsp;
kristina
Sue_jance, please call during the day between 9-4 CST to set up an appointment. I very much look forward to our work together. Also, you can go to our message boards any time to learn from others and share your own experience.

18:39:04&nbsp;
kristina
Product delivers are almost always within 3-7 days, even outside the United States.

18:39:21&nbsp;
kristina
I meant to say product deliveries...

18:40:13&nbsp;
bbholl
hmmm.... 1500 and 2500cc? - isn't that about 1.6 and 2.6 qt, respectively?

18:40:58&nbsp;
bbholl
out of curiosity, what would be a good reason to use a small enema bag like that?

18:41:16&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, bbholl

18:41:34&nbsp;
bbholl
oh good...my math was right :)

18:41:39&nbsp;
kristina
Price is one good reason. 

18:41:48&nbsp;
kristina
Other than that I would always recommend a larger bag. 

18:41:53&nbsp;
bbholl
good point

18:42:20&nbsp;
bbholl
would it be good for a small volume enema?

18:42:31&nbsp;
sue_jance
Another problem is I suffer from severe multiple chemical sensitivity, especially to smoke and even to detergents. Even hair shampoos make me suffer. This aggravated my condition. I lost weight from 53 to 45 kilos although it was gradual for a period of 6 months

18:42:50&nbsp;
kristina
However, some people can cleanse their colon adequately using the 2500 cc bag, or when they are clearing the lower colon only or for the small volume enema.

18:43:30&nbsp;
michael b
the transparent bag is the best idea going. Raymond Lowey pointed out clear plastic containers outsold the others 4 to 1. there must a reason.

18:43:34&nbsp;
Lisa
Sometimes I like to use a small bag instead of using a bulb to clean the lower part of the colon. I find that small bags are much easier than the bulb. That's how I feel anyway. Many folks are fine with the bulb.

18:43:51&nbsp;
kristina
I, too, had severe chemical sensitivities. That is a horrible condition to live with. I no longer have chemical sensitivities. You can be free of them, too.

18:44:15&nbsp;
bbholl
yikes! that's a low weight!

18:44:27&nbsp;
kristina
Who is Raymond Lowey?

18:44:30&nbsp;
bbholl
thanks Lisa, I have a bulb syringe right now

18:44:44&nbsp;
bbholl
you're right, it's not that easy at times

18:45:07&nbsp;
kristina
I agree with you, Lisa, that a bag is easier to use than a bulb syringe, as long as you can easily hang the bag.

18:45:21&nbsp;
Winc
2500cc is small?

18:45:21&nbsp;
Winc
:-O

18:45:41&nbsp;
kristina
No, I don't consider 2500cc small. It just isn't four quarts. If the goal is to clear out the whole colon, as if you were having a professional colon hydrotherapy session, then you will want to have access to a four quart bag for your enema series.

18:45:57&nbsp;
bbholl
I've heard people using those IV stands. Do you have any, Kristina?

18:47:06&nbsp;
bbholl
that's the size I think about when I think of an enema - sorry to imply that 2500cc is small

18:47:24&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, we do offer IV stands. I use an IV stand in my center when I give enemas.

18:47:51&nbsp;
Lisa
IV poles are great for enemas. Wouldn't know what to do without it! Kristina sells them on her site.

18:48:19&nbsp;
bbholl
great! - my shopping list is growing :)

18:48:41&nbsp;
sue_jance
I read the article of Julia Chang of Prime Health Products and the gallbladder/liver flush, but I don't like the bentonite clay and plantago seeds for the colon cleanse. Do you know each other? She's also from Canada. 

18:48:51&nbsp;
kristina
No, I do not know Julia Chag, but I am aware of her work.

18:49:26&nbsp;
Coastalcat
Kristina, can you tell me a little about how the goat's milk soap with frankincense and myrrh helps/affects the prostate gland in males?

18:49:51&nbsp;
michael b
an interview with on 60 Minutes called him one of greatest industrial inventors of the 20th century, most proud of being asked to design the interior of the Sky Lab 

18:50:31&nbsp;
kristina
 I will restate here though that a gallbladder/liver flush ALWAYS needs to be preceded by a supportive diet so that the liver is prepared. 

18:53:02&nbsp;
sue_jance
I would like to avoid a galbladder attack, but my pain is getting worse. I appreciate if this enema can be done in the soonest and  safest way possible.

18:53:28&nbsp;
sue_jance
I am scared of detox since once it almost took my life, if God did not perform a miracle 

18:53:51&nbsp;
kristina
Frankincense is considered a holy anointing oil in the Middle East, where it has been used in religious ceremonies for thousands of years. More recently, it has been used therapeutically in European and American hospitals and is the subject of substantial research.

18:54:19&nbsp;
sue_jance
Where do I start? I'm getting confused. Thanks

18:54:23&nbsp;
kristina
You can HEAL fully!

18:54:23&nbsp;
Lisa
Oh Kristina, I'm doing some research on raw milk in Europe. Finding out on their health and if their laws are like the silly laws we have here in the USA. I'll let you know what I find out!

18:55:06&nbsp;
kristina
Call my office on Thursday and set up an appointment. I think we can talked tomorrow. Tell Dee Dee that I will make time for you, even if she says I have a full schedule.

18:56:37&nbsp;
sue_jance
Thanks Kristina. God Bless to all!

18:56:50&nbsp;
bbholl
same to you!

18:57:21&nbsp;
Elsie
God Bless you, too, sue_jance.  I'll say a prayer for you.

18:57:41&nbsp;
Coastalcat
I found the goat's milk soap with frankincense and myrrh to be stimulating directly to my prostate....but can it be soothing at the same time? [as I mixed the solution quite strong]

18:57:53&nbsp;
michael b
kristina, the newer 70 hardness you said could be cut from 30 to 20 inches. can one be bought at 40 inches? have you cooked a square egg? 

18:58:12&nbsp;
Winc
I didn't know the forum existed. But it's great :-)

18:59:02&nbsp;
kristina
Young Living had a Frankincense and Myrrh blend called Protec for the prostate. It was horribly expensive but I could see that it was providing benefit to men with prostate issues. I also studied the benefits of butyrate, within milk, and its benefits to regeneration. This is how I came to develop the soap. The FDA could shut me down if I claim too much, but I am certainly getting lots and lots and lots of success stories from men who are using it.

19:00:14&nbsp;
kristina
Michael, I was going to ask if that is you. Thank you so much for the gifts. I so appreciated them. My husband's birthday was on Friday and he, being a farmer, is always in need of a decent pair of work gloves so I gifted him all the gloves. He was so touched. 

19:00:29&nbsp;
kristina
Also, I will be using the square egg maker this weekend for fun with my kids. 

19:00:52&nbsp;
Coastalcat
Can someone like me/us write you via email to learn the effects of soaps/solutions?

19:00:53&nbsp;
bbholl
and yet they do their best to keep you safe from idiots who would try to sell you deadly stuff

19:01:06&nbsp;
kristina
Okay, as great as this is and as many unanswered issues there are on the table, I must run to pick up my son from wrestling. 

19:01:26&nbsp;
kristina
The next live chat will be on March 14th, 4 days from my birthday on March 18th!

19:01:28&nbsp;
Lisa
Kristina, I'll email you about the raw milk in Europe!

19:01:38&nbsp;
kristina
Thank you all so very much for joining me on this lovely day.

19:01:48&nbsp;
bbholl
this has been wonderful!

19:01:56&nbsp;
bbholl
hopefully I can make it next month

19:01:56&nbsp;
kristina
I really can't tell you how blessed I feel to be a part of this developing community.

19:02:04&nbsp;
kristina
Good bye

19:02:06&nbsp;
kristina
Peace

19:02:18&nbsp;
bbholl
in my research, this has been the only legitimate site about enemas

19:02:28&nbsp;
bbholl
good bye all! :D
