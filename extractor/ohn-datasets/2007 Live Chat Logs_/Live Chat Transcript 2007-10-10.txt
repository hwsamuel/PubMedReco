Lisa
Great! I'm looking forward to hearing about that!

20:03:27&nbsp;
kristina

The conference I went to is a much smaller conference but with fabulous speakers. 

20:06:27&nbsp;
Lisa
That's all that matters!

20:07:05&nbsp;
kristina
This is an event not to be missed in Michigan and surrounding states and complements the highly regarded National Weston A. Price Conference &quot;Wise Traditions&quot; held annually in Washington D.C. for the past 7 years.  A unique opportunity to hear an inspirational range of expert speakers on important nutrition and health topics providing essential learning for our own personal quests in achieving optimal health.  In addition we will showcase delicious nutrient dense foods and drinks as validated by Weston A. Price throughout both days including hors d?oeuvre?s, snacks, lunch and drinks.  All food will be organic, mainly local, nutrient dense and delicious!

20:07:37&nbsp;
kristina
If you go to http://www.wisetraditionsmichigan.org/index.html, you can see that Optimal Health Network was a sponsor.

20:07:54&nbsp;
kristina
Also, I learned a lot from a particular speaker named Dr. Janet Lang.

20:08:09&nbsp;
kristina
She teaches how to balance male and female hormones.

20:08:30&nbsp;
Lisa
Hello winwip! Are you new here? If you want too, you can tell us about yourself.

20:08:34&nbsp;
Dave
Were they as open-minded to colon hydrotherapy/therapeutic enemas as hoped?

20:08:47&nbsp;
kristina
In practice for 27 years, Dr. Land now dedicates her time to ongoing research and teaching professionals seminars across the country on the following topics:      * Balancing Female Hormones Naturally     * Balancing Male Steroid Hormones Naturally     * Thyroid, Adrenals, and Blood Sugar     * The Cardiovascular System 

20:09:37&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, many people at the conference were very pleased to see us there. We had an assortment of enema equipment, which we sold. We did also sell quite a few of my book on colon cleansing and nutrition, Kristina Amelong's Ten Days to Optimal Health.

20:09:47&nbsp;
winwip
I am new to the chatroom!  I want to educate myself on how to get healthy.

20:10:03&nbsp;
kristina
Are you having any symptoms of ill health, winwip?

20:10:22&nbsp;
Lisa
That great winwip. Glad to have you here!

20:11:03&nbsp;
winwip
I have a whole and I do mean whole host of conditions and problems.

20:11:53&nbsp;
kristina
You would be welcome to share what is going on with you. I bet we can start you on the path to excellent health!

20:12:17&nbsp;
Lisa
Hi Denise! Glad more people are joining us now!

20:12:37&nbsp;
winwip
OK!  

20:13:14&nbsp;
Dave
Given that enema equipment not readily available as in earlier years. I figured you'd have buyers.

20:13:20&nbsp;
kristina
By listening to Dr. Lang, I was able to connect for myself how the adrenal stress response and associated blood sugar challenges effect both female and male hormone.

20:13:41&nbsp;
Denise
sorry I couldn't figure out where to type now I am good and Hello All

20:14:38&nbsp;
Lisa
Nice to have new members! Do you know about our message board?

20:14:39&nbsp;
kristina
And, what we can do about improving one's health using saliva readings.

20:15:04&nbsp;
Dave
Are you a newbie on the forum too, Denise?

20:15:14&nbsp;
Denise
Yes, I have been reading them for years and they are very helpful

20:15:49&nbsp;
kristina
Another subject that fascinated me at the conference was the connection between the mechanism of liver-gall bladder hormone detoxification and excretion and the necessity to facilitate this process in managing female problems.

20:16:07&nbsp;
kristina
Hi Denise. Good to see you here tonight.

20:16:20&nbsp;
Dave
This is the place to get instant answers and others' experiences. 

20:16:23&nbsp;
Denise
Thank you. Hello

20:17:02&nbsp;
Denise
I want to listen and learn and don't feel that I know enough about my problem to comment yet

20:17:47&nbsp;
kristina
So, more on hormones: Let's start with the adrenal glands:

20:18:08&nbsp;
kristina
Abnormal adrenal function can alter the ability of cells to produce energy for activities of daily living. People who have a hard time rising in the morning, or who suffer with a low energy level during the day, often have abnormal adrenal rhythms and poor blood sugar regulation. 

20:18:24&nbsp;
kristina
Abnormal adrenal rhythms are known to compromise tissue healing. Reduced tissue repair and increased tissue breakdown can lead to muscle and joint breakdown with chronic pain.

20:18:43&nbsp;
kristina
The adrenal rhythm determines how well we build bone. If the night cortisol level is elevated and the morning level is too high, our bones do not rebuild well, and we are more prone to the osteoporotic process. Stress is the enemy of the bones. In postmenopausal women, the effect of stress worsens due to the female hormone imbalances.

20:19:00&nbsp;
Denise
And as I learned today can cause constipation in some?

20:19:09&nbsp;
kristina
Various immune cells (white blood cells) cycle in and out of the spleen and bone marrow for special conditioning, and possible nourishment and instructions. This immune system trafficking follows the cortisol cycle. So, if the cycle is disrupted, especially at night, then the immune system is adversely affected. Short and long-term stress is known to suppress the immune response on the surfaces of our body as in lungs, throat, urinary and intestinal tract. With the reduction in the surface antibody (called secretory IgA), the resistance to infection is reduced and allergic reactions are believed to increase. 

20:19:20&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, and constipation...

20:19:30&nbsp;
kristina
The ability to enter REM sleep cycles, i.e. regenerative sleep, is interrupted by high cortisol values at night and in the morning. Chronic lack of REM sleep can reduce the mental vitality and vigor of a person and induce depression. 

20:19:44&nbsp;
kristina
Human skin regenerates mostly during the night. With higher night cortisol values, less skin regeneration takes place. So, a normal cortisol rhythm is essential for optimal skin health.

20:19:58&nbsp;
kristina
The level of cortisol at the cell level controls thyroid hormone production. Quite often, hypothyroid symptoms such as fatigue and low body temperature are due to an adrenal maladaptation.

20:20:12&nbsp;
kristina
About 12-18% of the U.S. population suffers from a genetic intolerance to grain. Specifically, a high incidence occurs in Celtic, Germanic, and Nordic derivation. The gut becomes inflamed within 30 minutes after consuming the grains and this can lead to an adrenal stress response, increased cortisol and reduced DHEA.

20:20:43&nbsp;
Denise
I was told to take my body temp upon wakening to see if I have low thyroid and it was low - is this what you mean?

20:21:39&nbsp;
kristina
As you can see, making sure your adrenals and your adrenal hormones are functioning properly are key to good health.

20:21:54&nbsp;
Denise
Is this siliac?

20:22:10&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, low temperature is one indicator of an underfunctioning thyroid.

20:22:23&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, celiac

20:22:44&nbsp;
kristina
But, also Leaky Gut Syndrome and IBS

20:22:47&nbsp;
Denise
not a good speller on the spot

20:23:03&nbsp;
kristina
just fine. just wanted to make sure we were talking about the same things

20:24:03&nbsp;
Denise
I have never felt the symptoms of irritable bowel - just the constpation. could I still have the celiac?

20:24:12&nbsp;
winwip
I am dealing with asthma,  bi-polar with hipomania, breast cancer (remission), COPD, fibromyalgia, lymphodemia, thyroid (Hashimoto), vertigo from a recent accident which includes, blurred vision and memory problems. I was on 15 different medicines. 

20:24:13&nbsp;
kristina
Yes and no.

20:25:24&nbsp;
Denise
Hopefully I will find out after this week, with Kristina's help I am going off of grains for the week to see if it helps.

20:25:54&nbsp;
kristina
You can have an grain intolerance that causes you ill health but isn't necessarily a &quot;condition.&quot;

20:26:09&nbsp;
kristina
Go Denise!!!

20:26:21&nbsp;
kristina
Winwip, that is a tough list of health problems.

20:26:41&nbsp;
winwip
I have more!

20:26:57&nbsp;
kristina
What things have you done to improve your health up to this point?

20:26:58&nbsp;
Denise
Thanks I need the cheering on, its not going to be easy I love my grains!

20:27:29&nbsp;
Carol45
Good evening.  I've missed you all. 

20:27:42&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, grains are the heart of many the diet..and for good reason...they are yummy, soft, sweet, filling, and more..

20:27:49&nbsp;
kristina
Hi Carol, welcome!

20:27:50&nbsp;
Dave
More the merrier, Carol

20:28:05&nbsp;
Denise
Hello

20:28:25&nbsp;
Lisa
Hi Carol! We all missed you, and am glad you can join us tonight! How are you doing Carol?

20:28:36&nbsp;
Carol45
See you're talking about grains.  I have found them hard to totally give up also.

20:28:39&nbsp;
kristina
Denise, make sure that you find other treats...hanging with a special friend, sitting in a sauna, music, movies, baby carrots...hehehe

20:29:20&nbsp;
Denise
Yes, I will have to get creative,  

20:29:57&nbsp;
kristina
Carol, as I was talking about earlier, but you aren't able to read any longer, I will now be doing tests that detect gluten antibodies and  helps identify grain intolerance

20:30:20&nbsp;
Carol45
Oh - what a great idea!

20:30:32&nbsp;
kristina
Here is more about the testing:

20:30:34&nbsp;
kristina
The Adrenal Stress Index? (ASI?) - Four saliva samples are used in the ASI? for the following ten tests:  4 x Cortisol  - Helps evaluate stress response; 2 x Insulin  - Helps investigate blood sugar control; DHEA  - Helps determine stress adaptation; Secretory IgA  - Helps evaluate toll on immunity; 17-OH Progesterone  - Helps determine adrenal reserve

20:30:45&nbsp;
Denise
That sounds like something I may need in the future

20:31:28&nbsp;
Carol45
Sounds like this needs to be done in your office - ?

20:31:34&nbsp;
kristina
Carol, how is your health these days?

20:31:40&nbsp;
Carol45
Stinks

20:31:59&nbsp;
Denise
Is the information available from the seminar that you recently went to Kristina, it sounds like it was packed with information?

20:32:14&nbsp;
kristina
The test is non-invasive and can be performed wherever you are.  Saliva is collected in vials that are sent to your home. 

20:32:17&nbsp;
Carol45
Guess it isn't that bad as I'm working every day, but getting little done at home. 

20:32:58&nbsp;
Carol45
I need to get your book out and start all over again from scratch.

20:33:50&nbsp;
kristina
I have been studying non-stop since I arrived home from the seminar and I have been studying this stuff for over two years but hadn't run into this mentor, yet. I have been working with thyroid, progesterone, vitamin D and more through my work with Metabolic Typing and Ray Peat.

20:33:57&nbsp;
Carol45
Is the new test listed on the site?  I just got a different monitor - have been having problems seeing and using the top of the screen correctly - so haven't been on the computer much. 

20:34:19&nbsp;
Denise
Has anyone here gone off of all grains and how has it been for you?

20:34:57&nbsp;
Carol45
When I cheat and eat them I feel rotten the next day.

20:35:32&nbsp;
kristina
The testing is only available at this point through a phone call. Technically, we are putting all our energies into launching our new website in November so I won't be able to add new products to the site until the site is launched and all the bugs are worked out. Call Dee Dee anytime if you have more questions, or email me at kristina@optimalhealthnetwork.com

20:36:00&nbsp;
Denise
So it does help you to refrain from them I presume?

20:36:17&nbsp;
kristina
I haven't eaten any grains for probably about 9 years. The healing I have been able to do is tremendous, both emotionally and physically. 

20:36:59&nbsp;
Denise
Do you ever miss eating pizza or sandwiches or pasta?

20:37:00&nbsp;
Carol45
Still no answer from the hair test lab via the chiropractor's office :{  so will be contanting Dee Dee on that subject also. 

20:37:24&nbsp;
Dave
What replaces fiber in grains to keep the system open and working?

20:37:27&nbsp;
Carol45
Rye bread

20:37:51&nbsp;
kristina
However, I did this work over many, many months of being very sick, grieving the loss of my beloved foods as well as all the loss that was connected to my lifestyle choices, like my brother dying...

20:38:02&nbsp;
kristina
Vegetables and fruits.

20:38:24&nbsp;
Carol45
I meant I miss rye bread.  Typed too slow. 

20:39:00&nbsp;
Carol45
Lisa, how did your last trip go?

20:39:04&nbsp;
kristina
Avocado Beans Broccoli* Brussels sprouts* Cabbage* Carrot Chick Peas/Garbanzo Beans Eggplant Greens -- collards, kale, turnip greens* Lima beans Mushrooms Potato with skin Pumpkin, canned Peas -- black-eyed peas, green peas Peppers Rhubarb Spinach* Sweet Potatoes

20:39:32&nbsp;
Denise
Kristina do you also do the meat and dairy along with veggies and fruits and are all the vegies you eat cooked?

20:39:43&nbsp;
Lisa
Carol, I have not left yet. I'll be leaving November 1st to Berlin Germany!

20:39:49&nbsp;
kristina
The vegetables with an asterisk are also goitrogenic, meaning that they promote thyroid enlargement and can potentially cause or aggravate hypothyroidism. Typically, the risk is highest when these foods are consumed raw, regularly, and in substantial quantity. Cooking eliminates most goitrogenic properties.

20:40:01&nbsp;
kristina
Highest Fiber Fruits Apples Avocado Bananas Berries -- Blueberies, Blackberries, Raspberries, etc. Dried Fruits -- Figs, Raisins, Apricots, Dates, etc. Guava Kiwi Orange Pears Prunes

20:40:46&nbsp;
Denise
so I can eat bananas? I was told to stay away because they may be constipating?

20:40:47&nbsp;
kristina
I do but since I was so very, very sick I have come to not miss any of it because I love be well SO VERY MUCH!!

20:41:21&nbsp;
Denise
Are you in good health now?

20:41:23&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, for some, bananas are constipating. I would limit those but you can have 1/2 a banana every other day or so...

20:41:37&nbsp;
Dave
Looks like there are plenty of alternatives to grain.

20:41:41&nbsp;
Denise
Ok I love them

20:42:06&nbsp;
Carol45
I ate a sweet potato the other night and was surprised that it raised my blood sugar as much as a regular potato would have. 

20:42:38&nbsp;
Denise
Kristina I wish you would put out a cookbook for us, I need ideas, also could you suggest one?

20:42:43&nbsp;
kristina
Most days but not every day. I no longer have chemical sensitivities, my energy is fabulous, I don't look sick anymore but I now believe that I haven't fully tackled my hormones, which keeps my tendency to gut inflammation up.

20:43:06&nbsp;
kristina
You always need to eat protein with all starchy vegetables.

20:43:17&nbsp;
kristina
Do you know how many grams of protein you eat per meal, Carol?

20:43:51&nbsp;
kristina
Spagetti squash makes fun noodles that you can dress up just like pasta

20:44:32&nbsp;
Denise
Now that I have stopped eating meat, I get little protein this may be messing me up,  and yes I do like spaghetti squash

20:45:13&nbsp;
kristina
I eat meat at EVERY meal. I eat every 2-3 hours. I eat 1-2 pound of grass-fed meat most days

20:45:29&nbsp;
Denise
Could I eat the pulp from my juicing veggies to get the fiber?

20:46:01&nbsp;
Denise
aren't you afraid of the cholesterol and fat in your blood?

20:46:30&nbsp;
Carol45
Not for sure.  12 - 14 oz of Kefir at approx. 7, 11, and 2, then salad and 4-6 oz meat for supper.  Back to my bad habits of not 'eating' all day long - or drinking enough water at work.

20:46:33&nbsp;
kristina
This means that I eat 100-200 grams of protein each day.

20:46:42&nbsp;
kristina
yes, you can eat the pulp

20:47:07&nbsp;
kristina
No, I am absolutely not afraid of cholesterol or fat. I have written about this extensively in my book.

20:47:14&nbsp;
Denise
Are you in ketosis and are your kidneys okay?

20:47:58&nbsp;
kristina
saturated fats are needed for energy, hormone production, cellular membranes and for organ padding

20:48:14&nbsp;
Denise
I'll have to read about this, there is so much information in every direction from ...

20:48:38&nbsp;
kristina
People with high cholesterol live the longest.

20:49:15&nbsp;
Carol45
I'm convinced that the cholesterol drugs are far worse for you. 

20:49:16&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, there is SO VERY MUCH information coming from every direction. I, too, struggle with this.

20:49:22&nbsp;
Denise
So is it misinformation that high cholesterol caused heart attacks etc.

20:49:31&nbsp;
Denise
I am sure you must?

20:50:01&nbsp;
Carol45
I know I feel a whole lot better when I follow Kristina's diet and her book. 

20:50:29&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, there is SO VERY MUCH information coming from every direction. I, too, struggle with this.

20:50:39&nbsp;
m2bozz
How do I get more information about HTMA?

20:50:59&nbsp;
kristina
That was weird-my whole post was deleted and a repeat post came out instead?

20:51:12&nbsp;
Lisa
The best source of iron is in red meat, and I feel much better when I have red meat in my diet.

20:51:34&nbsp;
Denise
do you eat it raw?

20:51:37&nbsp;
kristina
My book is a great place to read about the importance of fat in the diet, as is the book Nourishing Traditions, as is the website www.westonaprice.org

20:51:43&nbsp;
kristina
Sometimes

20:52:05&nbsp;
Lisa
No, I can't get use to raw meat, but I don't over cook it.

20:52:16&nbsp;
kristina
Here is a link to more information about HTMA.

20:52:17&nbsp;
Denise
What about parasites and e coli?

20:52:50&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, it is misinformaiton that high cholesterol causes heart attacks.

20:53:00&nbsp;
Carol45
Since I know exactly where my beef comes from, I can eat it as rare as possible - and have nibbled on raw. 

20:53:11&nbsp;
kristina
But it is not an exception; there are now a large number of findings that contradict the lipid hypothesis. To be more specific, most studies of old people have shown that high cholesterol is not a risk factor for coronary heart disease.

20:53:18&nbsp;
Denise
Would vegetable fats be equally beneficial and if not why?

20:53:58&nbsp;
m2bozz
Will htma help with diagnosing non-hereditary hair loss?

20:54:09&nbsp;
kristina
No, most vegetable fats are not equally beneficial because they are not the same type of fat

20:54:19&nbsp;
kristina
They are unstable at high temperatures.

20:54:36&nbsp;
Carol45
I love my coconut oil.

20:54:38&nbsp;
Denise
What if you eat them fresh?

20:54:42&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, the HTMA will help. 

20:54:53&nbsp;
Denise
and do they need to be saturated?

20:55:09&nbsp;
Denise
to be of benifet

20:55:29&nbsp;
Denise
benefit rather

20:55:41&nbsp;
kristina
Raw is often better, not always but vegetables are excellent for minerals and vitamins and fiber but they just don't have the type of fatty acids that you will need to heal fully

20:55:54&nbsp;
kristina
One needs saturated fats in order to be healthy.

20:56:27&nbsp;
Dave
Next chat?

20:56:54&nbsp;
Carol45
That late already?

20:56:55&nbsp;
Denise
Thank you for all your help
