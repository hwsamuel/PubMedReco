I am completely engrossed in spring. We have 14 new baby goats on our farm and the crocuses are coming up out of the garden. Dee Dee is involved in a spring cleanse using our Vit-Ra-Tox kit. I thought this would be one of the excellent topics that could happen tonight... What cleansing program do you follow in the spring?

18:01:58&nbsp;
210bob
Hi Kristina, just you and me, eh?

18:02:33&nbsp;
210bob
Hello

18:05:08&nbsp;
210bob
Kristina, I've been a follower of yours for a few years AND APPRECIATE ALL THAT you do. Thanx

18:05:26&nbsp;

Hi Kris

18:05:42&nbsp;
Mike K
Hi 210bob

18:06:11&nbsp;
kristina
hello

18:06:29&nbsp;
210bob
It's nice and warm here on the coast of SC

18:06:48&nbsp;
kristina
Bob, can you tell me more about yourself? Thank you for the appreciation. I love those.

18:06:54&nbsp;
kristina
And, you are welcome.

18:06:58&nbsp;
Mike K
Not bad in San Diego either

18:07:21&nbsp;
kristina
Wisconsin weather has been absolutely lovely. I spent most of Saturday, Sunday and Monday outside.

18:07:39&nbsp;
210bob
Bought your videos about two years again and started helping myself

18:08:17&nbsp;
210bob
feel a lot better now

18:08:33&nbsp;
210bob
am 67 and getting younger

18:08:44&nbsp;
kristina
Another topic at hand is that I am looking into launching a new silicone colon tube, FR 42 with a removable cap, length 40 inches. I have gotten feedback that more experienced enema users would like to see such a product. Any thoughts?

18:09:04&nbsp;
210bob
would love to try it

18:09:19&nbsp;
kristina
What health issues did you have 2 years ago that brought you to colon cleansing?

18:09:44&nbsp;
Mike K
what are the chances of the cap coming off inside the colon?

18:10:32&nbsp;
kristina
I wouldn't offer a colon tube that had a risk of the cap coming off. The cap will be produced by the same nozzle craftsman that produces our delrin nozzles. It will be made of delrin.

18:10:34&nbsp;
210bob
sluggish and a lot of diarrhea

18:10:46&nbsp;
kristina
That is an excellent question and was also one of my concerns.

18:11:29&nbsp;
210bob
have arthritis in my finger, so have to use two to type

18:11:31&nbsp;
kristina
What specific changes did you make that you credit toward your improved health, Bob?

18:11:59&nbsp;
kristina
I think you can get your body to shift away from the arthritis also.

18:12:25&nbsp;
kristina
Welcome, Major! Anything on your mind tonight?

18:12:33&nbsp;
210bob
my problems of old seem to have stopped with enemas 3-4 times a week

18:12:44&nbsp;
kristina
Welcome, Cowboy! Anything on your mind tonight?

18:12:58&nbsp;
major
arthritis??

18:13:20&nbsp;
Mike K
You could try bee venom

18:13:22&nbsp;
kristina
Congratulations! What solutions do you use with your enemas?

18:13:44&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, bee venom is a topic that has come up around these parts. Have you heard of people using bee venom, Mike?

18:14:16&nbsp;
210bob
sea salt followed by coffee

18:14:32&nbsp;
Mike K
I know a least three people who use it for arthritis

18:15:00&nbsp;
kristina
Also, for arthritis, you need to have a grain-free diet for a period of 35 days, to start. I would also experiment with using aspiring in enemas and orally. What do you eat each day?

18:15:02&nbsp;
Mike K
only if you're not allergic to bee venom

18:15:11&nbsp;
210bob
I wear a magnetic wrist band at it seems to help some

18:15:14&nbsp;
kristina
And, does it work for those three people?

18:15:38&nbsp;
Mike K
perfectly

18:15:43&nbsp;
210bob
not what I should

18:16:12&nbsp;
kristina
Most people aren't allergic to the honey bees that are used with venom therapy. Mostly people are allergic to yellow jacket wasps, I think.

18:16:22&nbsp;
210bob
I do all the cooking around here, so I fix what I like, not what's good for me

18:16:26&nbsp;
kristina
Would you mind sharing a sample daily diet?

18:16:32&nbsp;
Mike K
I know one who uses it for MS

18:17:00&nbsp;
Mike K
My Wife is is allergic to honey bee venom and one son

18:17:10&nbsp;
kristina
Good to know.

18:17:26&nbsp;
210bob
roasted red pepper soup 2-3 times a week.  Casseroles a lot because they're easy and last 2-3 days

Loking for help with vertigo and arthritis

18:18:12&nbsp;
kristina
Bob, have you tried the 35-day program as laid out in my book? Because it is only 35 days, laid out in ten-day increments, you might find it works wonders to make some of the changes you would still like to make.

18:19:07&nbsp;
210bob
no I haven't, but I will get it (the book)

18:19:09&nbsp;
Mike K
one of the side effects of the heart medications that I am on is vertigo (not good)

18:19:17&nbsp;
kristina
Major, can you be more specific? ie, where is the arthritis? do you have it daily? how often do you get vertigo? how long does it last?

18:19:55&nbsp;
210bob
Also, just found out I have COPD, which doesn't make my life and easier.

18:20:02&nbsp;
kristina
Keep me posted and do go to the colon health forum to ask me questions any time. Also, I am always available for consultation over the phone if you feel that you need additional support.

18:20:21&nbsp;
kristina
I am sorry, what is COPD?

18:20:54&nbsp;
210bob
chronic obstructive pulminary disease

18:21:12&nbsp;
210bob
have only 60% of lung power left

18:21:14&nbsp;
major
arthritis in joints daily for many years. It's the vertigo now for over a year that I really need help!

18:22:18&nbsp;
major
Looking forward to phone consultation

18:23:05&nbsp;
kristina
I, too, am looking forward to working with you over the phone, Major. What have you tried so far for these issues? What works? What hasn't worked?

18:23:22&nbsp;
kristina
What happened to your lungs, Bob?

18:24:43&nbsp;
major
Valium did not help, and I avoid drugs for arthritis other than an Aleve 

18:25:13&nbsp;
kristina
Sure, Mike. I would love to. I will send them out tomorrow.

18:25:16&nbsp;
210bob
Don't know.  It seemed to come on suddenly, but must have been slowly going down hill and didn't notice until I just started coughing and coughing and went to get medical help. Then they found it.

18:25:17&nbsp;
kristina
Thanks for asking.

18:25:42&nbsp;
kristina
Do you have a history of smoking or working around toxins?

18:26:08&nbsp;
210bob
quit smoking Oct 20,1980 after twenty years

18:26:43&nbsp;
major
What is best time to call?

18:26:55&nbsp;
210bob
worked five and 1/2 years in the coal mines in WV, but Dr doesn't see that as a contributing factor

18:27:21&nbsp;
kristina
Congratulations for quitting smoking. I am confident that you can heal your lungs. If not fully, than at least in part.

18:27:35&nbsp;
210bob
hope so!!!

18:28:06&nbsp;
kristina
I wonder why an MD wouldn't see working in the coal mines as a contributing factor to your lung health?

18:28:13&nbsp;
Mike K
certain drug interactions will take and accelerate COPD

18:28:29&nbsp;
210bob
sorry, but have to go. Have Bible study class in 15 minutes.  Very nice to chat with you. see you next month

18:28:50&nbsp;
Mike K
Namaste, 210bob

18:29:29&nbsp;
kristina
Major, Dee Dee, the woman that answers the phone here, works from 9-4. She also sees clients but if  she isn't able to answer the phone when someone calls, she will call you back. She sets up my appointments.

18:30:10&nbsp;
major
Thanks - talk soon!

18:31:06&nbsp;
kristina
Welcome, Chuck! 

18:31:44&nbsp;
Mike K
what with blood pressure medicine and other heart related drugs (not much) (LOL)

18:32:19&nbsp;
chuck
I'm new to the chat room, but have been reading the archives.  A while ago, you stated that you had noticed weakening in the anus, as time went on, under treatment.  What caused this?  And thanks.

18:33:11&nbsp;
kristina
I think aging, diet, and a history of constipation cause weakening of anus overtime.

18:33:22&nbsp;
kristina
Is this an issue for you?

18:33:58&nbsp;
chuck
Not now, but as I look into this and am thinking about starting it, it did cause concern.

18:35:24&nbsp;
major
Tell me something good about aging, other than alternative??

18:35:55&nbsp;
Mike K
you don't do as many dumb things  (S)

18:35:56&nbsp;
kristina
It certainly doesn't happen to most people and I don't think it is caused at all by using enemas. 

18:36:25&nbsp;
major
Right on, Mike

18:36:43&nbsp;
Mike K
or we hope so anyway

18:37:13&nbsp;
Mike K
as we get older our muscles lose elasticity 

18:37:33&nbsp;
chuck
Thanks.  Another question: What strength do you recommend for coffee enema?

18:37:52&nbsp;
kristina
You know, aging certainly is not what I want to have happen, but there are so many pleasant things about aging. For instance, yesterday I was walking down my driveway in the country. The sky was a brillant blue of different shades in the North, in the South and in the East and West.

18:37:59&nbsp;
kristina
It was absolutely fabulous.

18:38:07&nbsp;
kristina
I was in awe. My five-year-old said, Is it really that pretty to you?

18:39:36&nbsp;
kristina
One doesn't &quot;have to&quot; degenerate with aging as fully as we witness around us. However, it does take living a different lifestyle than those we see around us, as well.

18:40:11&nbsp;
major
For sure - and do take notice EVERY day!! just like to enjoy in better health!

18:41:39&nbsp;
kristina
Since we are slow tonight, I am going to head out because I have two clients waiting for me tonight. Any more questions, comments or the like before I close the chat? I sure do appreciate you all joining me.

18:43:02&nbsp;
chuck
Strength recommended for coffee enema as in tablespoons per quart?

18:43:12&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, I do have a sample of the new colon tube.

18:43:36&nbsp;
kristina
How much coffee one needs to use varies with the individual

18:44:34&nbsp;
Mike K
You can answer in the java applet window

18:44:48&nbsp;
Joseph
Hello!  I know I only have a few minutes, but nice to see you all

18:44:53&nbsp;
kristina
I recommend that a person start with a small amount of coffee, 1 tablespoon of brewed coffee in one quart of water. Some people will benefit from as much as a quart of brewed coffee in the colon for the 12-15 minutes but for some this amount of coffee with be too stimulating. 

18:45:36&nbsp;
Mike K
I use one cup of brewed coffee and 1qt. water

18:45:50&nbsp;
chuck
Thanks.  

18:45:53&nbsp;
kristina
The quantity needed is also affected by the type of coffee one uses. Always use a low-acid, high-caffeine, and high-palmitate type of coffee, which our made-for-enema coffee is.

18:46:06&nbsp;
kristina
Welcome, Joseph!

18:46:26&nbsp;
chuck
Have to go.  Thanks.

18:46:39&nbsp;
kristina
Anything on your mind? Due to other demands here at my office, I was about to close down but please do share if you have anything on your mind.

18:46:46&nbsp;
Mike K
Chuck, start low and work up

18:47:17&nbsp;
Joseph
Thank you!  Seems my timing is perfect as I am about to administer a coffee enema directly after chat

18:48:35&nbsp;
kristina
You are welcome. Enjoy. And do join us at the colon health forum any time with questions as well as your own personal experiences. Good bye to all.

18:48:53&nbsp;
Joseph
Thanks, take care all!

18:48:57&nbsp;
kristina
See you next month, the 2nd Wednesday of the month, which is April 11th.

18:49:08&nbsp;
Mike K
Talk to you later, Kris. Namaste.
