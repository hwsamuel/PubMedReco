Hi folks. Welcome. I am just finishing up dinner. Back in 5 minutes. Do feel free to suggest topics. I will fill you in on my ideas soon.

19:54:56&nbsp;
kristina
Carol, if you wish, i can talk about your Saliva Testing Results that came in.

19:55:03&nbsp;
Carol45
GREAT - I am anxiously awaiting them.

19:55:29&nbsp;
Carol45
Hi Denise

19:56:59&nbsp;
Denise
I am doing much better now that I am working the Kristina and the Weston A. Price diet

19:57:26&nbsp;
Carol45
Hi Heidi and Dave.

19:58:19&nbsp;
Carol45
I didn't realize how much better I was doing, until I went off for a few days.  After two days I felt lousy.

19:58:36&nbsp;
bhtimm
I am on the 5-day fast right now

19:58:41&nbsp;
Dave
Any topics of special interest tonight?

19:59:01&nbsp;
kristina
So, Carol, you are okay if others read, too?

19:59:13&nbsp;
kristina
Hello all.

19:59:20&nbsp;
Carol45
Absolutely.  We're all here to help one another. 

19:59:50&nbsp;
kristina
Denise, would you be willing to share the details of how you are doing better and what you are doing specifically?

20:00:13&nbsp;
kristina
How is the fast coming along, Heidi? Details.

20:00:14&nbsp;
Denise
Sure,

20:00:31&nbsp;
Carol45
The hardest part of the collection was rinsing my mouth with 'very cold water'.  My teeth are sensative. :o 

20:00:39&nbsp;
bhtimm
I have a concern...when I picked up the lavender soap I noticed it had hemp oil in it...I have to do drug screens

20:01:03&nbsp;
bhtimm
I am producing ketones...tested myself an hour ago with some strips I had left over from my failed-Atkins diet

20:01:13&nbsp;
Carol45
I use lavender oil on occasion.

20:01:18&nbsp;
kristina
Carol, do you floss at least one time daily? How do you brush?

20:01:54&nbsp;
Denise
I have had chronic constipation for years and now that I am eating healthy fats and eliminating grains (except for soaked grains, I am going without any help and am feeling so much better 

20:01:59&nbsp;
Carol45
I only have a couple lower teeth to hold my partial - but they let me know about it!!

20:03:27&nbsp;
Carol45
Billy, looks like you logged in without problems tonight. 

20:03:49&nbsp;
Denise
I used to have to take enemas and use cascara sagrada and it was still not normalizing me, but I went  off the vegetarian diet and back to good meats and fat etc and I can't believe the difference

20:04:01&nbsp;
Dave
Looks like a nice big turnout.

20:04:12&nbsp;
billythekid
Things have been going great all day. I woke up AGAIN this morning!

20:04:15&nbsp;
kristina
That is an interesting question, Heidi. I don't imagine that would show up in a drug screening test, but let's look into that. The oils is soaps are saponified but you can trade it in for one of the goat's milk soaps.

20:04:40&nbsp;
Denise
I am also devouring any information I can and the weston a price website is packed, also I read Kristina's book and have learned so much!

20:04:54&nbsp;
bhtimm
i told my board monitor about that, so no worry...but I'll let you know.  On cascara, I was telling Kristina I got sick off it!

20:05:11&nbsp;
kristina
That is great, Billy!

20:05:36&nbsp;
Carol45
Denise, I got the Price 'cookbook' and it too is packed with information. 

20:05:40&nbsp;
kristina
Free Cortisol Rhythm

20:06:16&nbsp;
Denise
Yes I did get it also and am making yogurt, and soaking my oats and other things, its packed

20:06:36&nbsp;
kristina
oh, a bit of background: I am now working with saliva testing, which I find to be a super tool to optimize one's health with. I am now going to post Carol's results:

20:08:19&nbsp;
kristina
7-8am-15 Normal, 11-12pm- 8 Normal,  04:00 - 05:00 PM 1 Depressed

20:08:29&nbsp;
kristina
11:00 - Midnight 3 Normal 1-4 nM

20:08:51&nbsp;
kristina
Low values are sign of adrenal deterioration.

20:08:55&nbsp;
Dave
K, any word on when the new OHN site will debut?

20:09:07&nbsp;
LoneEagle
Any ideas on what to take if one is all ready taking Miralax and senna and still moving slow? The cause of my slow system is due to heavy medication use

20:09:09&nbsp;
kristina
I know that this doesn't surprise you, Carol.

20:09:25&nbsp;
bhtimm
My values the second time I did it were a normal curve but low-normal noon, eve and night values

20:09:33&nbsp;
bhtimm
the first time I did it was a disaster

20:09:50&nbsp;
Carol45
I'm 'depressed' about the 'normal'. *) 

20:09:53&nbsp;
kristina
The new site is most likely going to make its debut within this next week.

20:10:01&nbsp;
bhtimm
it correlates well with my energy level which drops off about late morning

20:10:09&nbsp;
kristina
There is lots to work with using these results.

20:10:14&nbsp;
Denise
I just heard that Miralax should not be taken longterm, that it is a plastic, maybe Kristina could weigh in on this

20:10:35&nbsp;
bhtimm
one thing that really helped me was licorice tea -- for giving the adrenals a rest.

20:10:46&nbsp;
bhtimm
Esp. helpful in late morning or early / late PM.

20:10:49&nbsp;
Carol45
Ok = I'm ready to get started.  Afternoons are my absolute worst. 

20:11:21&nbsp;
bhtimm
I can comment on Miralax - it is a polyethylene glycol - actually related to antifreeze

20:11:27&nbsp;
kristina
Post-prandial insulin elevation comes from high carbohydrate intake, or  hyperinsulinic state usually associated with chronic stress and increased  cortisol production.

20:11:29&nbsp;
kristina
Post-prandial 21 Elevated Optimal: 5-20 uIU/mL

20:11:50&nbsp;
kristina
Fasting Insulin-  13 Hyperinsulinic Normal: 3-12 uIU/mL

20:11:52&nbsp;
bhtimm
how are those insulins drawn?  Or are they saliva too?

20:12:20&nbsp;
billythekid
I got some results from my annual physical last week. The Doctor said my good cholesterol was good, but my bad cholesterol was bad. Should I treat that with more good enemas?

20:12:24&nbsp;
kristina
Carol, this is a key reason why following the diet in my book helps you so much, it keeps your blood sugar stable.

20:12:27&nbsp;
Carol45
Chronic stress is a definite.

20:12:36&nbsp;
kristina
Eating often is one of your best ways to stay healthy.

20:13:04&nbsp;
bhtimm
http://www.fastingconnection.com/ketosis-explained-new.html

20:13:27&nbsp;
bhtimm
this is why my ketones in urine were encouraging - indicates near-zilch insulin levels

20:13:39&nbsp;
Carol45
Every three hours, with kefir (goat's milk) for two of the meals keeps me going just fine.

20:13:51&nbsp;
kristina
LoneEagle-do you eat LOTS of fruits and vegetables, along with lots of healthy fats and meats? I would target the diet first. Also, how often do you take enemas?

20:14:00&nbsp;
bhtimm
I am starting to get those cravings you describe in the book, Kristina :)  you know the ones you're supposed to resist

20:14:26&nbsp;
kristina
Thanks, Heidi and Denise

20:14:33&nbsp;
bhtimm
I am doing so well eating five-six small meals per day rather than join the crowd at lunch, I do my meals on my own time at work

20:14:36&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, we use saliva

20:14:53&nbsp;
Carol45
LoneEagle, did you get Kristina's question = it was when you dropped out for a minute. 

20:14:55&nbsp;
bhtimm
on actual lunch hour I take a walk on the treadmill in our onsite gym

20:15:08&nbsp;
LoneEagle
Ok if Miralax is bad which would be better senna or enemas?

20:15:14&nbsp;
Denise
So should I stay away from even soaked grains and sprouted bread at this time with my problems?

20:15:14&nbsp;
Dave
Like Billy, had physical recently and sugar a bit high. Advice orally or enema-ly?

20:15:50&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, the cravings, those can be tough. What are you feeling like would be excellent to eat just about now?

20:16:04&nbsp;
LoneEagle
No I did not

20:16:05&nbsp;
bhtimm
in the pharmaceutical world there are many olderfolk who are on the Miralax (now it's called &quot;Glycolax&quot;) daily indefinitely - not good

20:16:17&nbsp;
LoneEagle
What was the Q?

20:16:40&nbsp;
bhtimm
hmmm...not pizza as you suggested...I stopped at Whole Foods and got my raw cheese, pasture-fed yogurt and free-range eggs.

20:16:47&nbsp;
bhtimm
That would be good!

20:17:05&nbsp;
kristina
I would recommend cascara sagrada over senna but would need to know more about other factors in your lifestyle before I answered enemas or herbal laxative. Do you currently use enemas? If so, how do they work? What do you eat? How do you feel otherwise? 

20:17:08&nbsp;
bhtimm
I would say with what I know now, the enemas over senna

20:17:22&nbsp;
bhtimm
senna is a stimulant like Dulcolax

20:18:06&nbsp;
Denise
Are most of you now not eating any grains to keep your blood sugar in check?

20:18:11&nbsp;
Carol45
LoneEagle, Q about your diet - fruits, vegs, etc.

20:18:34&nbsp;
kristina
Also, I missed a question about cholesterol that is now gone, can you please ask again.

20:18:40&nbsp;
bhtimm
Kristina, how do you weigh in on Dr. Mercola's &quot;protein-type&quot; vs. &quot;carb-type&quot;?

20:19:02&nbsp;
Denise
I wondered that also

20:19:12&nbsp;
LoneEagle
I do not use enemas at this time I eat kinda so so I feel ok for the most part but I am not very active due to a back problem

20:19:13&nbsp;
bhtimm
He says for juicing protein types can only have the following juiced:  spinach, asparagus, string beans, cauliflower, and there was something else I can't remember.  A very limited list.

20:19:22&nbsp;
kristina
Michael, My family is doing very well. Thanks. My husband is looking for a job as a nurse. We have sold all of our farm related stuff and are looking to sell our beautiful farm. Rayna turns 6 next week.

20:19:37&nbsp;
bhtimm
Your husband is an RN?

20:20:05&nbsp;
bhtimm
I took the quiz in the Metabolic type book and I be much closer to Protein than Carb

20:21:18&nbsp;
bhtimm
sorry got kicked off

20:21:19&nbsp;
Denise
I am sorry to hear about your farm, I am sure that was a hard decision, but it had to be a struggle handling a farm and your job and children,

20:21:21&nbsp;
billythekid
I stated that my good cholesterol was good, but my bad cholesterol was bad. Should I treat that with more good enemas.? 

20:21:22&nbsp;
Carol45
Kristina, I have cut out most breads.  two or three times a week I do give in to my cravings and have something whole wheat.  should I cut them out entirely?

20:21:32&nbsp;
kristina
Dr. Mercola is using a version of Metabolic Typing. All people needs lots of protein, but what type of protein can vary between red meat versus more fish or eggs.  Some people need more fruits and vegetables whereas others need to stick with mostly meats and fats and raw dairy. Metabolic Typing is much more comprehensive than Mercola's types.

20:21:38&nbsp;
bhtimm
I'm interested in the cholesterol question too

20:22:23&nbsp;
kristina
Dave, eat protein with EVERY meal, eat every 2-3 hours, limit grains and sugars, add coconut oil to your diet. Might you do these things?

20:22:33&nbsp;
Carol45
Also what types of supplements should I be taking?

20:22:49&nbsp;
Dave
I could give it a try, for ure.

20:22:51&nbsp;
bhtimm
I read The Cholesterol Myth in the sauna - does that mean cholesterol is not correlated with anything, that it couldn't function as a barometer?  I hope not because my HDL is the best it's ever been at 74!

20:22:53&nbsp;
kristina
Denise, yes, stay away from grains for the next 3 months.

20:23:11&nbsp;
Denise
Okay

20:23:20&nbsp;
bhtimm
i've struggled getting it out of the 40's

20:23:30&nbsp;
kristina
Heidi, try to stick with liquids but eggs are fine, especially raw eggs. I am sure a bit of cheese would be just fine, too.

20:23:50&nbsp;
bhtimm
that's fine, I only have one more day :)

20:24:07&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, too much. It was awesome, but it degraded the quality of our life in other ways given that 3 of our kids still lived in Madison. 

20:24:20&nbsp;
kristina
I loved it. It was crazy. 

20:24:48&nbsp;
Dave
Glad I got to see it.

20:24:58&nbsp;
Carol45
I hope you can still get a supply of goat milk. 

20:25:30&nbsp;
bhtimm
Whole Foods sells raw goat cheese - DELICIOUS

20:25:52&nbsp;
kristina
No, high cholesterol isn't an indication of the need for cholesterol lowering drugs. Cholesterol need not be low in order to be healthy. What did you think of the book as a scientist yourself?

20:26:05&nbsp;
bhtimm
long time ago my husband's farm used to have 2 goats, both billys though

20:26:22&nbsp;
billythekid
My HDL was 46, but my LDL was 143.6. Overall cholesterol was 201.

20:26:26&nbsp;
kristina
Carol, we will talk about supplements fully over the phone. And, I will keep posting your results:

20:26:47&nbsp;
kristina
A depressed mucosal SIgA may be attributed to one or more of the following reasons: 1- Excessive chronic cortisol output causes a reduction in the number of SIgA producing immunocytes. Appropriate restorative treatments have been shown to produce incremental improvements in SIgA. 2- Excessive sympathetic activity causes inhibition of SIgA release from the mucosal immunocytes. 3- Chronic deficits in cortisol and/or DHEA levels. 4- Possible systemic deficit in capacity to produce IgA - an inherited problem. Rule out possibility with a serum IgA test. A normal finding rules out this possibility.

20:26:47&nbsp;
bhtimm
if I remember correctly HDL functions as an antioxidant and LDL represents it AFTER it's been oxidized.  Hence the HDL being the so-called &quot;good&quot;

20:27:15&nbsp;
kristina
Total Salivary SIgA 13 Depressed Normal: 25-60 mg/dl

20:27:32&nbsp;
bhtimm
my HDL 74 LDL 116 total chol 195 and triglycerides ONLY 27!

20:27:36&nbsp;
kristina
Raw cow's milk now

20:27:55&nbsp;
bhtimm
I do know that there is a correlation between triglycerides and insulin sensitivity

20:28:30&nbsp;
kristina
Carol: Gliadin-Negative

20:28:31&nbsp;
kristina
Gliadins are polypeptides found in wheat, rye, oat, barley, and other grain glutens, and are toxic to the intestinal mucosa in susceptible individuals. Healthy adults and children may have a positive antigliadin test because of subclinical gliadin intolerance.

20:28:45&nbsp;
Denise
I had the saliva test and Kristina is working with me to get me back to health and will let you all know how the supplements are helping me when I receive them and take them for a while

20:28:57&nbsp;
bhtimm
Kristina, I overheard you talking to a client about vitamin D.  Mine is borderline-low.  An MD (dr. selfridge, complementary medicine at GHC) suggested I take 3000 IU/ day and have it retested in 4-6 weeks.  What do you think?  Should I use cod liver oil? 

20:29:18&nbsp;
bhtimm
she suggested a straight D3, a couple brands available at Comm. Pharmacy

20:29:59&nbsp;
Carol45
So I can have a piece of rye toast on Sunday mornings?

20:30:19&nbsp;
LoneEagle
Ok so if I quit taking the miralax and started taking enemas would you suggest one two or more a day. If I do not take and medications for my slow system I move every three days

20:30:35&nbsp;
kristina
Hemp oil is an excellent choice to make into soap because of its high Essential Fatty Acid (EFA) content. Adding hemp to our soap has improved the moisturizing and afterfeel dramatically. The lather now is smoother, milder and creamier.  In late July, Canadian Customs stopped a shipment of our soaps at the border. The soaps could not enter because of their hemp oil content. Not only is all of the hemp oil we use certified and compliant with Canadian regulations, with the THC content at less than 10 parts per million*, but we actually use oil purchased in Canada in the first place! Health Canada is not interested in the fact that we can document that the hemp oil that goes into the soap is certified Canadian compliant; they only want to see the finished product tested. 

20:31:15&nbsp;
michael b
kristina, i have watched both of your movies, the 2nd one i have questions about, but i will write a letter with those questions, i can only start to imagine how busy you are, you can read it when and if you have time?

20:31:27&nbsp;
bhtimm
Oh, thank you so much for that info Kristina!

20:32:06&nbsp;
Lisa
Hi everyone! I'm glad at least I can make it the last half hour! I had a rehearsal tonight for Sunday's recital!

20:32:19&nbsp;
LoneEagle
Hi Lisa

20:32:28&nbsp;
Denise
Hi Lisa

20:32:39&nbsp;
bhtimm
Hi Lisa

20:32:53&nbsp;
Dave
Ditto

20:32:53&nbsp;
Lisa
Good group here tonight!

20:33:11&nbsp;
Denise
Lone Eagle are you on the diet in Kristina's book, it may really help you. I had the worst system and now I am good.

20:33:14&nbsp;
kristina
Billy, might you set up a consult. There are many factors to consider and I want to make sure that we cover them all. The best and most simple change to make is with the diet. Have you read my book? Might you follow the 35-day plan laid out in it?

20:33:18&nbsp;
Carol45
Good evening Lisa, it's a busy night.  We've got questions of all kinds.

20:33:25&nbsp;
Lisa
Is there a topic tonight?

20:33:45&nbsp;
kristina
It would be fine to ask it now?

20:33:49&nbsp;
kristina
Hi Lisa

20:34:04&nbsp;
Lisa
Hi Kris!

20:34:05&nbsp;
kristina
I lost the Vitamin D question, sorry. Please ask again.

20:34:16&nbsp;
LoneEagle
No I am not sounds like a good place to start if you think it will help

20:34:30&nbsp;
Denise
Absolutely!

20:34:49&nbsp;
Carol45
Kristina has been going over my saliva test results.  there is loads of information.

20:34:53&nbsp;
kristina
I LOVE IT! I just wish the text wouldn't disappear so quickly!

20:35:03&nbsp;
bhtimm
I had my 25-OH D3 checked and it was borderline low.  So Dr. Selfridge from complementary med at GHC suggested I take 3000 IU/day and retest in 4-6 wks.  I did purchase a cod liver oil product, but she suggested straight D3.

20:35:04&nbsp;
kristina
Maybe I can change that for next time.

20:35:22&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, it will help! What do you think, Heidi, Carol and Denise???

20:35:42&nbsp;
bhtimm
think about what?!?

20:35:44&nbsp;
billythekid
Who is Lisa?:) 

20:35:56&nbsp;
Denise
Go to the Weston A. Price website also it is packed with info

20:36:09&nbsp;
kristina
Why test for insulin? Insulin activity is affected by the stress and cortisol responses. Chronic stress with cortisol elevation antagonizes insulin, and may cause functional insulin resistance. Furthermore, chronic hypercortisol causes hyperinsulin responses to carbohydrate intake. Chronic insulin resistance and overproduction lead to pancreatic exhaustion.

20:36:10&nbsp;
Lisa
Lisa is Waterwoman!

20:36:14&nbsp;
Denise
and my system was so bad, I had to do something to go

20:37:10&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, we have straight D3 at the office. I would recommend 10,000 throughout the winter. Our D3 is from Biotics Research.

20:37:32&nbsp;
bhtimm
10000 IU Daily?!

20:37:35&nbsp;
bhtimm
wow

20:37:35&nbsp;
kristina
Who tested your D3? How did you think to test it? How was it tested?

20:37:44&nbsp;
Denise
I was eating high fiber because I thought it was good for me and am finding out that it was misinformation and was infact hurting me.  Try the raw milk and lacto fermented veggies, and make beet kvass, I can't stress this enough, it really did help me.  

20:37:55&nbsp;
bhtimm
I had seen Dr. Selfridge in March of this year.  She suggested getting it tested in Nov.

20:38:14&nbsp;
LoneEagle
I would use Biscoplax waited 2 HR then had to use a second one sometimes

20:38:15&nbsp;
bhtimm
at first my primary MD drew the wrong one - the 1,25

20:38:16&nbsp;
Denise
Is that 10,000 per day of D3?

20:38:19&nbsp;
kristina
Think about if the dietary changes you have all been working through will help to optimize one's health and cholesterol levels...

20:38:40&nbsp;
bhtimm
25-OH is the one that assesses nutritional status

20:39:02&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, per day.

20:39:18&nbsp;
kristina
It is a trick to keep up with this lively chat!!!

20:39:19&nbsp;
LoneEagle
Which is the name of the book Denise?

20:39:35&nbsp;
Denise
Of course the first thing to do is listen to what Kristina has to say because she really does her research and has a lot of experience

20:39:53&nbsp;
Denise
The book is Ten Days to Optimal Health

20:40:18&nbsp;
kristina
Vitamin D is a steroid hormone precursor that has recently been found to play a role in a wide variety of diseases. Current research indicates vitamin D deficiency plays a role in causing seventeen varieties of cancer as well as heart disease, stroke, hypertension, autoimmune diseases, diabetes, depression, chronic pain, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, muscle weakness, muscle wasting, birth defects, and periodontal disease.

20:40:22&nbsp;
LoneEagle
Ok that's what I thought it would be but wanted to make sure

20:40:28&nbsp;
Denise
Also Wise Traditions by Sally Fallon for the great recepies

20:41:02&nbsp;
kristina
If you totally avoid the sun, recent research indicates you need about 4,000 units of vitamin D a day. Which means you can't get enough vitamin D from milk (unless you drink 40 glasses a day) or from a multivitamin (unless you take about 10 tablets a day), neither of which is recommended.

20:41:15&nbsp;
kristina
Most of us make about 20,000 units of vitamin D after about 20 minutes of summer sun. This is about 100 times more vitamin D than the government says you need every day.

20:41:23&nbsp;
LoneEagle
Denise do you use emenas also or just the diet?

20:41:26&nbsp;
kristina
the only way to be sure you have adequate levels of vitamin D in your blood is to regularly go into the sun, use a sun bed (avoiding sunburn), or have your physician administer a 25&#8209;-hydroxy vitamin D test. Optimal levels are around 50 ng/mL (125 nM/L).

20:41:48&nbsp;
Denise
So can I also take more than 2000 per day with the test results you saw from me

20:41:51&nbsp;
bhtimm
FYI my levels are about half the optimal

20:41:55&nbsp;
bhtimm
22 ng/ml

20:41:59&nbsp;
bhtimm
a little less than half

20:42:05&nbsp;
LoneEagle
How much time in the sun bed?

20:42:36&nbsp;
bhtimm
Dr. Selfridge did not recommend the sunbeds for this reason:  EMF

20:42:39&nbsp;
Denise
Yes LoneEagle, I did do the enemas, but now I am so normal, I don't need them.  I am 52 and I was all messed up. But I feel so much better now.

20:42:47&nbsp;
bhtimm
electromagnetic frequencies

20:43:01&nbsp;
bhtimm
Dr. Mercola concurs with that

20:43:17&nbsp;
LoneEagle
Ok thanks

20:43:56&nbsp;
Denise
Sure thing. Good Luck

20:44:00&nbsp;
bhtimm
wow that's a potent product - alternatively can you rub it on your skin?

20:44:02&nbsp;
Lisa
I sure don't need a sun bed here in Texas! We have beautiful winters here most of the time. What a beautiful sunny day we had here today! But no, I won't rub it in. LOL!

20:44:04&nbsp;
kristina
How much time in the sunbeds depends on how tan you already are, right, just like being in the sun. I use them for 10 minutes, two times weekly. 

20:44:34&nbsp;
kristina
No, if you can be outside all year around you won't need the sunbed, but if you can't you will need to figure other ways to keep your Vitamin D levels up.

20:44:43&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, you can rub it on your skin

20:44:47&nbsp;
bhtimm
I don't think she said you COULDN'T use beds, just that she felt there was that risk, and certainly not as good as old-fashioned sun.  Woe to us though, we live in Wisconsin!

20:45:06&nbsp;
Lisa
Funny Kris!

20:45:06&nbsp;
LoneEagle
Ok is sun bed time equal to sunshine time?

20:45:34&nbsp;
bhtimm
Kristina do you know what your D levels are?

20:45:43&nbsp;
Denise
What is better ingesting vitamin D or putting it on your skin?

20:46:11&nbsp;
bhtimm
so, raw milk does have some NATURAL vitamin D?

20:46:39&nbsp;
Carol45
I got booted out - and then this contraption froze up.  Sure hope this gets printed up.  I know I missed a lot. 

20:46:43&nbsp;
kristina
No, you spend less time in a sunbed. I would recommend being outside as often as you can and tanning up to one hour per day.

20:47:02&nbsp;
kristina
No, I do not know what my Vitamin D levels are, mostly because I have no health insurance

20:47:03&nbsp;
bhtimm
I know the pasteurized has artificially added--and a correction, I believe your book (and Mercola's) says D2, it is D3 as per the label (I don't have any in my house, just noticed as I was walking in the store to check)

20:47:08&nbsp;
kristina
Ingesting

20:47:25&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, raw milk is good for Vitamin D

20:47:38&nbsp;
Denise
Thanks

20:47:47&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, all chats will be on the new site but not when it is first launched over this next week.

20:48:04&nbsp;
bhtimm
I will be the &quot;guest celebrity&quot;!

20:48:07&nbsp;
LoneEagle
Ok another Q what gets rid of gas besides a fast moving system

20:48:08&nbsp;
bhtimm
LOL

20:48:15&nbsp;
Denise
Looking forward to seeing the past few chats they are packed with information

20:48:32&nbsp;
Carol45
Me too, as well as the new site!

20:48:35&nbsp;
kristina
Cutting out the food that is causing the gas, mostly like a grain product. What is your diet, LoneEagle? 

20:48:35&nbsp;
bhtimm
one thing we tell patients in the hospital is walk around

20:48:40&nbsp;
bhtimm
for ridding gas

20:48:45&nbsp;
Dave
Sources tell me the new site will be pretty spiffy.

20:48:49&nbsp;
kristina
Also, you might find that you  would benefit from taking some food enzymes.

20:49:03&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, you will be Heidi!

20:49:12&nbsp;
bhtimm
:)

20:49:13&nbsp;
Denise
Since I changed my diet I have almost eliminated my gas

20:49:18&nbsp;
LoneEagle
To much bread products for starters

20:49:24&nbsp;
Lisa
Is KJ still the webmaster?

20:49:37&nbsp;
Carol45
I have had to eliminate all nightshade veggies.  That has helped the gas. But, boy when I get a green pepper! 

20:49:43&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, too much bread:( 

20:49:50&nbsp;
bhtimm
I love bell peppers

20:50:07&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, KJ is still with me.

20:50:07&nbsp;
bhtimm
esp. the colored varieties, and more nutritious, too

20:50:19&nbsp;
bhtimm
who's KJ?

20:50:27&nbsp;
LoneEagle
I love it but I was brought up on a diet high in breads and red meat

20:50:32&nbsp;
Denise
Kristina can you now do soaked grains, now that you are healthy?

20:50:34&nbsp;
LoneEagle
high

20:50:57&nbsp;
bhtimm
I am drinking raw milk now and it's making me crave cornflakes now :(

20:51:03&nbsp;
LoneEagle
Um roasted bell peppers are great

20:51:34&nbsp;
kristina
Next Live Chat, Wednesday, January 9th at 7 p.m., CST. I do so appreciate all of you for being a part of tonight's Live Chat. I would love to hear from some of you, What you are looking forward to in this coming month as we all say good-bye!

20:51:37&nbsp;
Denise
Me too LoneEagle, but you will not miss it if you are eating more fats and protein and fermented foods

20:51:56&nbsp;
bhtimm
I am curious if you can tell the difference btwn. the Holstein and Jersey milk at that Amish farm.  Say you let it sit...can you notice the Jersey has more cream rise to the top?

20:51:58&nbsp;
LoneEagle
I probably should stop eating cereal every morning right?

20:52:08&nbsp;
kristina
LoneEagle-you might be surprised how much you like a healthier diet, you might find yourself eating lots of red meat.

20:52:34&nbsp;
kristina
NO, I do not eat any grains.

20:52:39&nbsp;
bhtimm
I can tell you Lone I don't get constipated on raw dairy the way I do on pasteurized

20:52:42&nbsp;
Carol45
My 10 day diet has lasted over a year - with a few lapses!  What a difference.

20:53:05&nbsp;
kristina
Yes, there would be a bit more cream with the Jersey milk.

20:53:07&nbsp;
Denise
Wow! Good for you!

20:53:18&nbsp;
bhtimm
I will confess and say I ate a Haagen-Daz the night before I started my fast-but a normal amount, not the whole pint!

20:53:18&nbsp;
kristina
yes, what else might you like to eat for breakfast.

20:53:19&nbsp;
LoneEagle
Ok what places can you find raw dairy

20:53:22&nbsp;
billythekid
I am looking forward to and hope everyone here has a Merry Christmas and a Healthy New Year!!

20:53:39&nbsp;
bhtimm
that is my &quot;lapse&quot;  - do I need to take a white keytag, Kristina?

20:53:45&nbsp;
LoneEagle
Sausage yogurt

20:53:51&nbsp;
bhtimm
but otherwise I have done great

20:53:55&nbsp;
kristina
I am taking a trip to Mexico and Belize with my mom, my son and my daughter for 12 days over the Winter School break. I am very much looking forward to it.

20:54:11&nbsp;
bhtimm
I'm glad you get to go!

20:54:13&nbsp;
LoneEagle
eggs

20:54:14&nbsp;
kristina
Might you also eat an orange or another type of fruit with the sausage and yogurt?

20:54:24&nbsp;
Dave
Don't drink the water!

20:54:29&nbsp;
LoneEagle
Yes i like citrus

20:54:31&nbsp;
Denise
have a great trip!

20:54:38&nbsp;
Carol45
Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night. 

20:54:44&nbsp;
kristina
Yummy...ice cream....you might learn to make your own....

20:54:50&nbsp;
Lisa
Most of Europe has raw dairy. Too bad it's not common here!!

20:55:07&nbsp;
kristina
I feed my kids ice cream all the time, I consider it a healthy treat, as long as they eat some healthy protein before the ice cream.

20:55:20&nbsp;
kristina
go to realmilk.com for sources of raw dairy.

20:55:29&nbsp;
LoneEagle
Do you work in the medical field bh?

20:55:33&nbsp;
bhtimm
I was able to get about a pint of raw cream off the top of a gallon and drank that straight

20:55:39&nbsp;
bhtimm
yes, I'm a pharmacist

20:55:48&nbsp;
LoneEagle
Ok

20:55:49&nbsp;
michael b
reading some of the older chats, said stil having tonsils is good.

20:55:57&nbsp;
bhtimm
but I am a full believer in alt med

20:56:02&nbsp;
kristina
yes, still having tonsils is VERY good.

20:56:06&nbsp;
LoneEagle
My main cause is medication-related

20:56:08&nbsp;
bhtimm
and your appendix too

20:56:24&nbsp;
LoneEagle
is

20:56:36&nbsp;
Denise
All five of my siblings and I had ours removed

20:56:57&nbsp;
kristina
Hi Stella, we are just about finished, but do have anything to add? We start at 7, CST

20:56:58&nbsp;
Dave
I somehow escaped the tonsil-taking craze as  a kid, happily.

20:56:59&nbsp;
bhtimm
I am curious about Activator X.  Is its only source green grass?

20:57:05&nbsp;
Denise
I'll have to look up the downside, but nothing I can do now

20:57:21&nbsp;
bhtimm
to say if cows are eating hay for fodder they have no hope of getting it?

20:57:31&nbsp;
stella
No, I've just been &quot;listening&quot; and trying to take notes.  It's a lot of info..

20:57:36&nbsp;
bhtimm
my father-in-law goes all the way out to SD to get hay for his cows

20:57:42&nbsp;
kristina
Activator X in organ meats from grazing animals

20:58:02&nbsp;
stella
I do have 1 question:  I live in NY. does anyone know where I could get raw milk?

20:58:05&nbsp;
bhtimm
the cows on my husband's farm do not graze, but they get a good amount of hay

20:58:17&nbsp;
bhtimm
extra hay that is

20:58:29&nbsp;
bhtimm
they of course grow their own too, but of course not always fresh

20:58:43&nbsp;
kristina
Butter is also a rich source of the substance, especially when it comes from cows that are eating fast growing grass during the spring and fall.

20:58:51&nbsp;
kristina
Your best bet for Activator X-rich butter oil

20:58:54&nbsp;
Denise
Do you refrigerate your butter oil or can you leave it out?

20:59:16&nbsp;
firestar
Hi all.  Wish I could have made it on earlier.

20:59:22&nbsp;
kristina
www.realmilk.com for raw milk. I know you can get it in NY but am not sure where. The site has a guide to where.

20:59:30&nbsp;
kristina
You can leave it out.

20:59:35&nbsp;
bhtimm
thanks I saved it in my favorites

20:59:36&nbsp;
LoneEagle
bh could you tell me what diet changes to make if I give you a lost of my meds?

20:59:39&nbsp;
kristina
Hello Firestar

20:59:44&nbsp;
LoneEagle
list

21:00:03&nbsp;
bhtimm
I can maybe with Kristina's help

21:00:24&nbsp;
bhtimm
I can clarify some medication-related issues for her, she would probably be the better for the diet issues per se

21:00:32&nbsp;
kristina
LoneEagle, Heidi and I would love to consult with each other to help you out. Please make an appointment soon.

21:00:47&nbsp;
michael b
kristina, you really need a break, have a wonderful time.

21:00:53&nbsp;
kristina
Good night all, I will shut us down now. I hope to see you all next month.
