A friend of mine who's 25 is thinking about getting circumcised. I told him he's freak'n nuts for thinking about it. Does anyone know someone who got a circumcision as an adult? Were they happy with the result? How painful is it?

I have never known anybody who had the procedure done as an adult, and I'm not exactly sure how it works. I always hear online and on tv about people saying it hurt, but I really don't know for sure.

It might be really hurting and painful to get it done as an adult. What I knew about is when a child is born at that minute the skin is really soft and easily removed rather than at an adult age. Anyways, I don't know anyone who have got this done so can't say exactly how much it hurts.

I don't personally know anyone that has done this as an adult but I do know that I have read that one of the main reasons that they do this when you are a baby is because it is a lot less recovery time.

I never saw an adult circumcision although I used to assist on vasectomies sometimes. The wise physician will prescribe an anti-anxiety pill or two. I would think that the area would be numbed before the procedure begins, by freezing spray or novacaine. I would think there would be some pain and soreness, but I think perhaps the anticipation would be the worst part of it for a guy. I wish him luck!

Pain control isn't usually used for infants where it is used with adults.

Wow, I had no idea that they don't typically use anything to help with the pain on infants. In that case, I can see less pain, but might be a worse experience in general.

Is it really important to get this circumcision done or is it up to parents wish whether they want their baby to be circumcised or no?? Do the doctors ask the parents or they just do it?? Somehow I am not sure if I want my son to be circumcised but my husband says we will have to, I am in thoughts....

Circumcision is an unnecessary procedure, unless there is a deformity associated with the foreskin. You just tell the pediatrician and your other doctors to leave the foreskin in place, and then end any further discussion. Cultural reasons for circumcision range from preventing the mother from manipulating the penis to ideas about cleanliness, that again focus more on the mother's manipulation and cleaning of the penis....power issues, IMHO. My sons were not circumcised and have never had any problems. You probably need to ask your husband why he feels the son needs to be cricumcised. You might find that his reasons are not sound and find a way to avoid the procedure.

I have three cousins who were not circumcised who got infections, supposedly due to not being circumcised. I have always had the notion that it's not as hygienic to be uncircumcised, but that's really just the impression I get from experiences with family (like above) and a doctor's comments when we got my younger brother circumcised.

I can't imagine why anyone would want to have the circumcision operation as an adult, unless there was a medical reason for it. And in the case of a medical reason, then I guess the pain of the op issue would be secondary to the pain of the medical problem. I don't agree with circumcision of infants. I've never heard a convincing enough argument to make me agree that removing parts of a child that are supposed to be there is a good thing.

Our nephew, who is three months older than our son, was not circumcised, and our son was. He got a few infections when he was in diapers, but also has had some off and on as an older child and adult. One unforeseen complication of keeping his foreskin was that we took the kids to the beach when they were younger, and our nephew happened to get some sand under his foreskin. The poor kid was in alot of pain, and even after a soak in the tub and a couple of good rinses, he had raw patches on his penis that didn't go away for a week or so. My circumcised son had not one problem with the sand.

That is what I have heard from a lot of people, and why I have always thought of getting a son circumcised as being the safest way to prevent infections &quot;down there&quot;.

Hell I would assume that it does if it hurts a new born baby.

I am 29 and I am having a circumcision because the skin at the end of my foreskin has lost it's elasticity. I honestly don't want to lose it all, I love having a foreskin because the head of my penis is pretty sensitive and i love it....I am trying to see if i can maybe get a partial instead of the full cut but I guess have to talk to my doctor before the procedure. This by no means is a hygiene issue the medical term is known as Phimosis....

well im going in on nov 20 2008 to have it done so i will let you know after how painful it is 

10-25-2008, 08:12 PM

not becase of hygiene either its what i think they call progiea the skin has got tighter at the opening and the skin splits when its pushed over the end so short term pain is better then another 50 or more years of this type of pain

Yow, Sage. You can certainly make the determination that your sons not getting circumcised. I don't know what to think about the implications about mothers who have their sons circumcised cutting pieces off our son's bodies. I never tried to imply that you would want your son to get penile infections; that would be mad. I didn't see circumcising my son as some kind of power issue, I wanted him to not get infections, never have to worry about cleanliness or the higher incidence of penile cancer.
