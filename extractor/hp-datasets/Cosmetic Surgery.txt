Not sure if this really fits here or not, but there doesn't seem to be a forum for just &quot;skin&quot; issues. A few (3-4 months, maybe more) ago, I had a small red bump form on my chest. It's located in line with my nipple and the top of my armpit, so it is visible sometimes depending what shirt I wear. It doesn't hurt, or really itch or anything. But it is growing. It's gone from a tiny speck to being 1/8&quot; diameter and 1/8&quot; tall (sticking out from my body). It still seems to be growing . I'm attaching a very poor quality picture of it, just so you can see. It's tricky trying to take a picture of it myself Any idea what it is? How to make it go away? I did ask the doctor back in September about it, while I was in for a yearly check up (I only have a medicentre, no family doctors seem to be taking patients around here). She pretty much completely brushed it off as some &quot;strawberry&quot; thing where she claims blood collects under the skin, and that it will go away on its own. I am going to see if I still have access to the dermatologist I saw a bit less than a year ago. Would this be something she could help me with?
