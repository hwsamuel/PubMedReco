hi! so i started birth control on october 2nd, on the day i got my period. i'm on alesse 28 and today, two weeks later, i still have my period. i'm really paranoid about it. my boyfriend and i had sex before i was on the pill, unprotected. i don't know what it could be so i'm dying for some help. my period was normal, and went away for about a day but then it came back kinda brown, but starting yesterday its red again. what is it?
