Hi All: I am a 48 year old woman. I have hypothyroidism and hashimotos disease which is untreated because I hate medications of any kind. Hate side effects. One of the symptoms I have struggled with my thyroidism is anxiety which I have been able to deal with finally to an extent. My question is... I have not had a mentstrual period at all in 5 months. Nothing . Lately, I noticed I have been having mood swings. I can start the day happy, 2 hours later feel sad, few hours later feel tired, few hours later feel angry and irritable, Then I feel anxious without any reason. What a roller coaster of emotions. My questions are: 1) Is this menopause? 2) What stage of menopause? That confuses me. 3) What foods can I eat to eliminate these emotions? If any. I do not want to take herbal remedies as they can have side effects too. 4) How long does this mood swing crap last for? And just for the heck of it...5) Why do men not ever have to deal with the crap we have to go through as women? Any suggestions or personal stories that relate to mine? Thanks
