Hi All I'm new to this forum. I am 3 weeks in to this new programme called hypnotension in the UK. I have not misspelled it its Hypnotension not hypertension. I just wondered if anybody else has experience with it? So far the results are looking positive I started at 182 over 70. I am 74 years young. My doctor has put me on various types of meds none of which made any difference. However my bp is now 165 over 80 so the top one has dropped nicely but the difference is dropping which is important apparently. So I just wondered if anybody else was trying it. Regards Steve
