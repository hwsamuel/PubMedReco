We all know by now that sunblock/sunscreen is a necessity to help protect ourselves from skin cancer. Which SPF number do you choose and why? I think the higher the better if it takes care of both kinds of rays... On the same subject, does anyone know why they keep manufacturing screens that are number 15 if higher is better? For what reason would number 15 be used?

I think that they make the lower ones just so they target the ones that still want to prevent some of the UV rays but still want to get tan. I have two red headed sons so we use the highest one possible.

I use the same as my kids which is a really high factor. We found a good one which stays on all day so you only need apply it once which is great. When I was younger (and child-free) I used a lower factor and sunbathed, but it was more important to get a tan then!

I think I'm a type who'd think it wasn't enough, though, and end up deciding it's not worth the risk. After all that we've learned over the past decade or so, I really don't care much about tans any longer.

I'd use one million spf if it were available, I'm pretty fair skinned and not a big fan of sunburn

If you don't mind what is the brand that you found that you only have to apply once a day? I would love something like that. Thanks.

I always have the highest. I have two grandsons that are red heads, and they come over and swim in our pool. Being red heads and skin so fair that is what I use.

I was told by a dermatologist I worked for that psoriatics (people who have psoriasis)were lucky in one respect in that they do not get skin cancer. I rarely use SPFs because I am not a burner as I have olive skin and brown eyes, and exposure to the sun helps to make the psoriasis less. My husband, who has blue eyes and fair skin, I always put SPFs on, usually around thirty. Those spray-on brands are really good, I think.

I always use the highest SPF I can find when I do use it. However, I prefer to keep the kids covered up rather than use any sort of protection. They are fair, so it's safer to make them wear T-shirts &amp; caps than rely on cream. My eldest got very burnt in patches once when I relied on a friend to smother him in cream &amp; she missed bits. Green-Moo

I make a point to stay out of the sun as much as possible because I have yet to find a face product that will last all day. Most SPF protection suggests reapplication at certain intervals which is impossible if you wear make up.

Most SPF protection suggests reapplication at certain intervals which is impossible if you wear make up. I stay out of it as much as possible, too. The only time I can't really avoid it is the week or 10 days we always spend in Florida. We keep applying screen and it works just fine, but it's annoying to have to keep doing that. I really need some kind of hat before we head down there again... but I've never been a hat person.

I also try to avoid being in the sun for any length of time, and I usually go for the highest number when I'm choosing a sunscreen.

While we're on this topic, does anyone know how long the stuff stays effective? I bought Neutrogena last fall for Florida because it had gotten the best ratings. It's a great sunscreen... is there any reason to think that the same tube won't be good to use again *this* year?

I think, first, we have to know what SPF means: The SPF is based on how long your skin can stay in the sun without burning compared with unprotected skin. So someone whose skin starts to redden after 10 minutes on the beach would get 150 minutes of skin protection from an SPF 15 sunscreen and 300 minutes of protection from an SPF 30. The difference is the time, not the protection level. And bear in mind that the result is based on ideal lab tests. In reality, most people use much less than recommendation (some say only 1/4 was applied on average) and do NOT reapply as instructed. Higher SPF sometimes give us wrong message that we can stay in the sun for the whole day, which is really dangerous.

I think they suggest that you should buy new each year as it loses it's effectiveness. I'm inclined to think that they would say that though and treat it with a certain amount of cynicism.

15 SPF is the best for all type of general skins. You should only use more SPF products when consulted by the physician. Otherwise 15 would be fine.

Good info! In my perception the original concept of SPF signifies how many times longer it takes for the sun to redden your skin when you&#8217;re using a given sun protection product, versus how long it would take to redden without protection. =============================== awaremed.com

After reading your column for ages, I dutifully bought myself moisturizer with sunscreen (Olay Complete All Day Moisture Lotion) and used it all winter. Now that itâ€™s spring and the UV is cranking up, I started using a 70 SPF for my face (Neutrogena Dry Touch sunblock). I also have a tinted moisturizer that I use instead of foundation to smooth out my blotchy skin (Clinique Moisture Sheer Tint, which also has SPF 15 in it). That seems like a lot of layers for my face every morning. Do I need all of it? Just the sunscreen and tinted stuff? In what order should I put it on? It seems strange to put sunscreen on top of makeup, but equally strange to put moisturizer on top of sunscreen. Thanks for any advice you can give!!

SPF 15 is mostly used world wide. According to my opinion it works for 7-8 hrs and Sun raise also affects for 7-8 hrs. But it depends on your geographical situation, may be in hot areas you need some extra prevent as compare to cool areas.
