Hi there, My son is 3 1/2 months old, and just recently my nipples have been getting real sore while I latch him on... They have been getting really dry and peely, and have been cracking.. I've been putting breast milk on my nipples as well sometimes, just to ease it a little, as well as nipple ointment. I also have a 1 1/2 old girl, I breastfed her till she was a little over 1 yr old, everything was fine with her. Anyways, my husband reminded me that I should put my whole areola in his mouth if I can, b/c it seems as though he's just got the nipple in his mouth.. makes sense. I'm in almost excruciating pain when he latches on for the first few seconds.. my nipples hurts sooo bad!! Is there a remedy that would help me, or something I should do more of besides putting my whole nipple in his mouth...?? Something I could put on my nipples to heal them... I need some help here, I've been in this pain for almost 2 weeks.. This has never happened to me before. Thanks for reading my concern!
