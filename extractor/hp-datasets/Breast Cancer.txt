I think it's great to be seeing more awareness events and the popularity of pink ribbons and so on. Things like screenings are important and the more people who know about it, the better their prognosis can be if it's caught early enough.

This is so true. I had I guess you would say a wake up call concerning this about a year ago. I lost a friend to breast cancer. She was only 30 years old. Within a year of finding it she had passed away. This is something that is so important because it just helps you to find it early which is the best thing you can do.

Tater, I'm sorry for the loss of your friend. I am fortunate to not have a family history of breast cancer, but that doesn't mean I don't do self-examination every month. I hope everyone does!

Thanks, it really threw me for a loop that's for sure. But opened eyes as to how it important it is to make sure you do the self examinations and get the mammograms. I am lucky in that it doesn't run in our family either.

Tater, I too am sorry for the loss of your friend. When I asked my doctor about a mammogram, he said it's not necessary to start doing them until I'm 50 because there is no history of breast cancer in my family. Well, a friend of mine just had her first mammogram at 48 (no history in her family as well) and they found a 3cm malignant growth! She did not feel this during her self exam. I think women should be doing breast self-exams at least monthly and mammograms long before the age of 50!

Tater, I hope everything goes well for your friend. Last time I had a mammography they had a poster up which showed the size of the growth that mammography can pick up,and it was hardly bigger than the size of the head of a pin.

Mammograms catch abnormalities much earlier, before they can be felt during an exam.

I had my first mammogram five years ago. I was nervous about it, but once it was done, I felt a kind of relief that nothing showed up. It's essential that women have their yearly mammograms done, early detection on anything is key.

What a hard loss for you. I had my first mammogram last year, and it actually picked up a lesion I couldn't feel with my fingers. Luckily, further testing showed the area was benign but it was sure a wake up call to me. From now on, I'm getting a mammogram every year without fail!

I have a sister who is 15 months younger than I am and she had breast cancer about 12 years ago. She is a survivor. It does increase my chances of getting breast cancer but so far, I'm okay. I'm pleased to be part of a company (Avon) that sells some of the pink awareness products. All profit goes to help with breast cancer research.

It is not all about breast cancer. For many health realted problems people are not that much awareness which helps them to treat that on time.

sorry to bust anyones bubble but my mother was diagnosed with bilateral breast cancer. she had a mammogram done 6 months prior that showed nothing. the screening need to be done either at the same place or have the records transferred so that they can be compared from the previous screenings. comparing the 2 can detect a different type of breast cancer that is not picked up by mammograms. lumps are detected but sheets of cancer is not. a woman needs to tell her doctor that the bra that used to fit is either too tight or too small now.

Speaking of breast cancer awareness; I recently bought Cashmere bathroom tissue and was pleased to discover that a portion of the cost was going directly to the Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation. I looked more into their involvement and discovered that they host an annual fashion show fundraiser and numerous on-line contests all linking to breast cancer support. I honestly find this admirable that companies that have the financial and marketing resources actually use it for a good causes. If you're interested in learning about this visit cashmere.ca. There's a ton of good info and different ways you can get involved. Does anyone know of other companies that are doing similar things?

My friend Barb is running BC awareness events in different places from the Atlantic to Vancouver - amazing lady. Wish I could do it too.

I have read that surgeon advice any female above 40 years to do a &quot;mamogram&quot; every year for early detection of breast cancer That is because breast cancer is very aggressive, but doctors think that early detection carries a better outcomes

Hi All, Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women all over the world and lots of work to be done to bring awareness in women to deal with breast cancer. Women struggling with breast cancer must avoid sunflower, safflower, corn, cottonseed oils, white flour, white rice, white potatoes and sugar and increase salmon, tuna, mackerel, sardines, lake trout, tofu, edamame, roasted soy nuts and soy milk.
