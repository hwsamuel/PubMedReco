What is it that needs to happen in a friend's relationship that would make you move from &quot;it's really not my business&quot; to &quot;I need to do something about this&quot;? Would it need to actually move into physical abuse before you'd do anything?

We've watched a crazy sister-in-law trash her life with the person she lived with, but to my knowledge it didn't involve physical abuse, so I guess after trying to talk to them, the physical abuse would be a milestone for getting involved.
