Does anyone happen to know of anyone taking this medication for Leukemia? Just was wondering if they had a lot of side effects and if it worked for them? Thanks, a friend of mine was just diagnosed with Leukemia.

Never heard of it, what did the doctor suggest for your friend?

Thank you so much. I will send this link to her to read over. I know she seems to be doing good on this medication but it sure is expensive. Thanks again.
