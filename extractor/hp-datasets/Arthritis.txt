What type of Arthritis are we talking about? Osteoarthritis (OA) or Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)? If it is OA, which is the most common, glucosamine has been proven to be more affective than placebo, and just as effective as ibuprofen, without the effects that NSAID's have on the body. Another suggestion would be to stay as active as possible.
