I think I have to explain more,if we suppose he is infected by HIV, and we have used condom,but he touched the condom by his hand in order to fix it better,may be the condom was infected,and during to try annal sex that short contact to blood without any entry may cause to infect me.is it possible? what do you mean by At no time did you have an exposure?thank you
