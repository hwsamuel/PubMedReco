Forgive me if this is posted in the wrong section.. I am new here. I would like to know how smoking a small amount of pot compares to smoking cigarettes, in terms of cancer or other lung damage. To put it into perspective, if someone takes a couple of hits (short drags on a small pipe) a few times a week at night to help to get to sleep, can this cause lung cancer or other cancer problems?

Doubtful. Heat is bad for lungs as it causes irritation. There would be more tar in weed than tobacco.

I wont say more injurious because cigarettes also contain nicotine which is very harmful to he body.It cause amputation of digits or limbs and problems with vein contraction amongst many.
