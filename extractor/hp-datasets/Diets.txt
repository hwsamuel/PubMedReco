Hi, I've been more active recently and been dieting. My weight has been steadily going down and when I reach my target BMI (21.5) I plan on gaining muscle weight. First, what good high calorie food should I consume for easy energy conversion when I do cardio? I heard bananas are pretty good. Other good easily convertible source of energy? Second, what should I eat more to develop my muscles? Proteins I suppose? I heard that egg white are good source of protein and as long as I don't eat the yolk, it should be pretty healthy. Any other source of protein?

Haha, 4 month after posting that, there is finally a reply. This board is so dead. Well thanks for the reply. You'd be glad to know that I've already started to drink green tea like a month ago.

Protein rich food is good for growth as well as repair.I think you must go for cereals,meat,milk that too at least 3 glasses a day.

Hello you all, I truly have to ask you smth really crucial! I just stopped to inject myself botox , after years of treatments.Evidently you know why. So, in this new position, I should switch the botox with something else, I have a preference to a less dangerous invention, because if not my skin will drastically change not for good. I've been recommended to operate with a small device, a home spa which operates with a galvanic current and unique creams, when the producer that has patented it states that it affects on our genes and the procedure is not just for lifting the skin, but in addition it slows the process of aging from its origin. I am prepared to buy it by now, but I have to have your support initially, also if you know where I can buy it, so please let me know what you know about it and if you've ever tried it in the past.Do you know someone who has? I really thank you for your opinion.

Eating good high calorie foods is beneficial in several situations and best for the good health. Dark chocolate is a nutrient and antioxidant packed food that is well worth the calories. high-calorie breakfast is the best for this.
