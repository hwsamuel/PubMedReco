Most bone cancers actually spread there from other primary sites... starting in the bones is rather rare. Treatment for it now is much better and more effective than it was in the past due to the chemo and radiation treatments that are available. Osteosarcoma is the most common bone cancer... if you or someone you know has this type, which of the treatments did they choose?

Am I right in thinking that Osteosarcoma is one of the more common cancers to affect children?

There are a few cancers that primarily hit children, yes... osteosarcoma strikes boys more often than girls, but not solely. Many times it starts around the knees, (sometimes upper arm) and often in teens. The risk increases (but only slightly) if the child is extra tall.

He had chemo and also had his right leg amputated. There just didn't seem anything that helped for him.

If I remember right Osteosarcoma is prevelant in children. Isn't it a hard cancer to beat? I have never known anyone personally with it though, thank goodness.

I'm most awfully sorry to hear that Molly. Cancer is so prevalent these days that almost everyone knows someone who is or has suffered.

Common type of bone cancer is Osteosarcoma. It occurs mostly in the knee and upper arm. Primary bone cancer is rare. It accounts for much less than one percent of all cancers.

Hi, Bone cancer is a malignant (cancerous) tumor of the bone that destroys normal bone tissue (1). Not all bone tumors are malignant. In fact, benign (noncancerous) bone tumors are more common than malignant ones. Both malignant and benign bone tumors may grow and compress healthy bone tissue, but benign tumors do not spread, do not destroy bone tissue, and are rarely a threat to life. Thanks,

Primary bone cancer is where a cancer originates in a bone. It is a rare type of cancer. There are several different types. Bone is a living tissue. There are two main types of cells within the hard bone tissue that make and mold bone.

Bone cancer is a malignancy in bone. Cancer that originates in the bone is termed as primary bone cancer. This type of cancer is very rare. Children are effected mostly by this type rather than adults.

I wish you a speedy recovery I think osteosarcoma has 3 lines of treatment: a. Surgical excision (if localized to bone) &amp; filling the defect using bone chips b. Radiotherapy c. Chemotherapy The last 2 lines of treatment are used if the tumor is widespread

Bone Cancer is is now a days very common. The primary precautions are very much important for this. Now a days due to the chemo and radiation treatments that are available and it is the very effective treatment on Bone Cancer.
