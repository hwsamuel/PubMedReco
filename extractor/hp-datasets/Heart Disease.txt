last night when I woke up, i feel my left lips uncontrollable and my tongue is numb like get scalded. my jaw seems weak in eating and have a little discomfort in drinking water coz it kept coming out from my left lips. I have a sleep disorder these couple days. I'm 29 years old and weight 95 kgs and height about 1,65 meters. Is this a mini stroke or TIA. thanks for the help and information.
