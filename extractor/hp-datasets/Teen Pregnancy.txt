Okay so started a new birth control about three months ago, after the first couple weeks I had sex with my partner. I had my period a week later. The next month I decided to skip my period because I was in my first week at university and I did not want to have to deal with it. This week I have had a lo of cramping and gas. I had a bit of discharge with some brown in the the other day, yesterday I started spotting and today I had more then just spotting. I'm hoping to get my period next week bu I'm nervous that I mIght be pregnant. Is it possible or are all thoses symptoms bEcause I started a new birth control and skipped my last period ??
