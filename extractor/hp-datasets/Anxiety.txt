On Saturday I went out drinking and could have possibly had 14 drinks. I also smoked quite a bit and I'm a non smoker. I've regrettably done this before. SInce last night (24 hours ago) I've had what I think is like anxiety quite bad. Feels like a constant adrenaline rush or the feeling of have to much caffine. I missed work today. Any thoughts? Advice? I'm a 29 year old male!

Mate never do something which could cause you to regret, and if you do just forget it, time and life never stops..better to move on.
